Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,859
Kurt Siefried and my partner in writing bad code.

2
00:00:10,869 --> 00:00:11,229
Josh

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:11,880
Reser.

4
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:16,909
Yes. And I don't mean I don't know about that intro for today. We have a guest today.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,620
Actually, we have

6
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:18,270
Jill

7
00:00:18,389 --> 00:00:22,079
Monet Correo, Director of product Security Engineering Response at

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,469
github, which I guess is kind of a fancy way of saying you run the github bug bounty.

9
00:00:26,479 --> 00:00:29,850
So, Jill, welcome to the show. We're really excited for you to be here.

10
00:00:30,139 --> 00:00:33,330
-- Thank you so much for having me. I'm excited to be here.
-- Fantastic.

11
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,369
So, so tell us, tell us what you do

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,590
and, and kind of what's going on.

13
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,790
So I guess the short version is I organize chaos.

14
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:43,229
Um But

15
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:47,119
what I really do is I manage the teams,

16
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:52,459
the product security incident response team as well as our bug bounty in that,

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,060
just like I said, organizing chaos. It's a,

18
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:56,180
it was a fun time

19
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,290
doing what I do

20
00:00:57,419 --> 00:00:58,669
setting the stage for everyone.

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,650
Kurt and I spent a very long time at Red Hat doing product security work.

22
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:04,319
I mean, this was back before it even had a name.

23
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,919
I remember we what do we call it originally? It wasn't product security, it was

24
00:01:08,589 --> 00:01:09,769
security response,

25
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,930
whatever doesn't matter, doesn't matter a long time ago.

26
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,879
So we're very excited for you to be here

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,959
and, and I guess I want to start out with the bug bunny because

28
00:01:17,089 --> 00:01:19,669
Github has a pretty big bug bunny.

29
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,339
And I would just love you to explain

30
00:01:22,589 --> 00:01:24,830
what is a bug bunny because we're gonna have people

31
00:01:24,839 --> 00:01:26,750
listening that think they know what a bug bunny is.

32
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,559
But I think as anyone who's ever managed a bug bunny,

33
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:33,279
what we think it is and what it really is are two very different things generally.

34
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:34,480
Very true.

35
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,610
Um So a bug bounty is an open forum for

36
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:44,050
folks of all abilities to report vulnerabilities to a company.

37
00:01:44,059 --> 00:01:46,410
So for us, we are looking for

38
00:01:46,529 --> 00:01:49,489
any and all walks of life to send us a report in on

39
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,790
something that they think doesn't quite fit their expectation of our product.

40
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,599
Whether that ends up being a valid report or not, we'll

41
00:01:57,705 --> 00:02:02,394
interact with that person, coach them maybe in the right way to get a valid report.

42
00:02:02,404 --> 00:02:05,214
And then at the end, we'll reward you with some money,

43
00:02:05,224 --> 00:02:10,524
maybe some new fun non monetary rewards that we're launching soon

44
00:02:10,684 --> 00:02:12,505
in the case where it's not a valid report.

45
00:02:12,514 --> 00:02:14,324
We'll go ahead and coach you for the next time.

46
00:02:14,544 --> 00:02:17,324
-- That
-- is definitely not something we really did when we were at Red Hat.

47
00:02:17,335 --> 00:02:20,524
When you say coaching. No, I'm actually really intrigued now. So

48
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:21,220
in,

49
00:02:21,649 --> 00:02:22,339
because again,

50
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,919
my traditional view of bug bounties and eating security reports is like,

51
00:02:25,929 --> 00:02:27,369
that's not about go away.

52
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,919
I have work to do. So, you're talking about coaching them.

53
00:02:29,929 --> 00:02:31,360
So, what does that involve?

54
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:31,750
Yeah.

55
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:36,649
So especially in the last few years with the state of the world, we've seen a lot of

56
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,910
folks coming to

57
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:41,815
bug bounty to kind of test their skills, test the waters.

58
00:02:42,104 --> 00:02:45,244
So we see a lot of folks who are reporting their

59
00:02:45,434 --> 00:02:47,925
first vulnerability in that

60
00:02:48,115 --> 00:02:50,714
we might get a report that doesn't quite meet our scope,

61
00:02:50,725 --> 00:02:55,205
even though we have a pretty broad scope, pretty much no holds barred there.

62
00:02:55,554 --> 00:02:59,445
But if they don't meet the scope or if they're

63
00:02:59,695 --> 00:03:04,384
kind of going down the path and maybe we can give them some documentation to

64
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,910
push them further so that they're able to be successful

65
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:10,619
and then we can celebrate their first win with them.

66
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:13,960
We want to see people be successful. We want to keep the doors open.

67
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,789
We want you to report your first vulnerability to us.

68
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,509
We think it's so special to have that community

69
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,720
come to us and report things.

70
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,350
All right, Jill,

71
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,350
I'm going to ask you to clarify what you mean by scope because there's a link,

72
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,949
I'll put a link in the show notes, you have a scope on the website,

73
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,550
but I would like you to explain that.

74
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:36,490
Yes. So for anyone who has not participated in a bug bounty. It

75
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:40,419
is not free and open fields on every product.

76
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:47,100
Every bug bounty has some bounds, there is a little bit of a fence to keep the cows in.

77
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,699
You want to,

78
00:03:47,804 --> 00:03:51,574
you check that out for each individual product. So for us,

79
00:03:51,735 --> 00:03:54,104
uh, we want you to focus in

80
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:56,664
on our heavy hitters. So

81
00:03:56,794 --> 00:03:57,785
github.com,

82
00:03:57,794 --> 00:03:59,574
come on and take a look if you're

83
00:03:59,585 --> 00:04:03,384
seeing repo permissions or something that just doesn't

84
00:04:04,054 --> 00:04:07,945
smell right spidey sense. However you want to equate it to you.

85
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,759
Um, go ahead and look at our scope,

86
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:14,029
see if it falls within the bounds and then send it over.

87
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:14,589
Now,

88
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:18,190
like I said, we want you to report your first vulnerability to us. So

89
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,510
even if you're not sure send it over, there's no

90
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,470
harm in sending it over to us.

91
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:26,540
I noticed you explicitly have a like a safe harbor.

92
00:04:27,109 --> 00:04:29,709
I don't want to say agreement necessarily like, because I guess,

93
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,619
well, it's not really a click through, but it's just you've stated that, you know,

94
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,049
basically boils down to

95
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,660
you're not going to sue them if they report security flaws to you. Which

96
00:04:38,149 --> 00:04:41,489
as we, I we did this years ago with the auto industry announcing that we're like,

97
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,440
that is actually a massive step forward for large companies to officially say that.

98
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:48,410
Yeah, and we, we do have to reiterate it at times,

99
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,410
but we do want to make sure that everyone is aware of that case.

100
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:52,730
And,

101
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,200
you know, just

102
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,269
be a good human report, things be actively involved in the community.

103
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:01,910
So, one thing I'm curious about is I'm actually just looking at your bug

104
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,679
man results.

105
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:03,540
Number one,

106
00:05:03,549 --> 00:05:06,109
I love that your top leader board person has tried

107
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:09,480
to put a javascript um escape into his user.

108
00:05:10,829 --> 00:05:12,720
But one thing I'm curious about is so

109
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,899
a lot of the bug reports are undisclosed. And

110
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:20,959
like, I guess one thing I've noticed is like we have, there tends to be, I find,

111
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,230
especially in the web space weirdly not so much the software space,

112
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,049
but in the web space,

113
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,170
like there'll be

114
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:29,600
like trends, I guess would be the word I'm looking for. Like somebody reports a bug

115
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,000
and then like six more people report the exact same bug. And it's kind of like,

116
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,440
like, is it the same person, like what is going on? Right. And

117
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,420
I'm wondering, do you, does github

118
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,450
also see that

119
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,619
-- we
-- do, um usually the trends that we see tend to be the same

120
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,619
hacker or researcher pulling on the same thread. Now,

121
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:50,480
sometimes if they're a little more involved in the community,

122
00:05:50,489 --> 00:05:54,660
they're actively participating or engaging with other researchers,

123
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:58,140
we'll see a group of them kind of hit the same spot because,

124
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,940
you know, they're chatting in whatever forum saying, hey,

125
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,700
yeah, I found something here.

126
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,359
They may team up together,

127
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:08,230
uh they may individually attack and at times, you know,

128
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:13,000
that causes collisions where they may report the same thing, duplicate reports.

129
00:06:13,309 --> 00:06:14,959
But for the most part,

130
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:18,059
usually it's one individual researcher pulling on the,

131
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:20,779
-- the same thread. All right.
-- So

132
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:22,950
you just said something,

133
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,410
I think that not everyone recognizes or I guess understands about

134
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,859
bug bunnies is when two researchers report the same thing,

135
00:06:30,869 --> 00:06:33,059
what happens in that situation.

136
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,019
-- It really
-- depends, it depends on the program.

137
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:38,940
It depends on the team that's managing it.

138
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,420
Usually,

139
00:06:39,429 --> 00:06:45,470
if there's a duplicate report with a mitigation or a fix in play at that point,

140
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:48,519
we will inform you that, hey, this is a

141
00:06:48,739 --> 00:06:49,910
duplicate report.

142
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,970
We're already engaged in a fix, engaged in the response activity.

143
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,380
Um So it may not

144
00:06:56,529 --> 00:07:01,450
qualify at that point for a reward. We may give you a thank you reward.

145
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:06,440
We're quite known to be generous in that regard of, hey, thanks, we appreciate it.

146
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:11,059
And then on the other end, if it's before we've even gotten a chance to

147
00:07:11,429 --> 00:07:14,829
maybe triage validate the vulnerability to

148
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:19,049
start a mitigation at that point, we may duplicate the report

149
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,250
and then go ahead and reward both parties for what it is.

150
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,290
And, and I guess we should also clarify,

151
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,829
you use hacker one to manage your bug bounty program, right?

152
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:29,559
Yes,

153
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:34,380
we originally did not. We started doing it homegrown and then a few

154
00:07:34,494 --> 00:07:37,994
years back, we went ahead and joined the hacker one platform.

155
00:07:38,295 --> 00:07:38,734
I just,

156
00:07:38,744 --> 00:07:42,725
I can't even imagine like the tax implications of trying to pay people and like,

157
00:07:42,734 --> 00:07:44,524
do you even know where they are half the time, right?

158
00:07:44,535 --> 00:07:49,234
-- And I just, yeah,
-- I actually have some experience with that. Um So before I joined

159
00:07:49,765 --> 00:07:53,674
github, I was part of starting up the Apple Bug Bounty.

160
00:07:53,684 --> 00:07:55,674
I was on the team that maintained that

161
00:07:55,924 --> 00:07:57,575
and we did that homegrown and

162
00:07:57,765 --> 00:08:01,434
that was definitely a struggle of tax and

163
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:02,915
all that craziness.

164
00:08:03,309 --> 00:08:06,029
OK? I want, I want to clarify what this means because

165
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:10,529
I also went through this, I started the bug bunny program at Elastic and

166
00:08:10,929 --> 00:08:13,440
every that I feel like there's this bug bunny journey,

167
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:17,170
you could document of this like just sinusoidal wave of ups and downs.

168
00:08:17,179 --> 00:08:20,950
And one of the stages is always we could do this ourselves.

169
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,989
But when you are a United States company,

170
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,959
there are places you necessarily can't engage

171
00:08:28,204 --> 00:08:29,114
with people

172
00:08:29,244 --> 00:08:30,255
and send them money.

173
00:08:30,265 --> 00:08:31,475
For example, like there's,

174
00:08:31,484 --> 00:08:35,815
there's a list of countries that are banned and so explain kind of that piece of

175
00:08:35,825 --> 00:08:38,094
it because you've obviously participated in two huge

176
00:08:38,104 --> 00:08:39,683
bug monies and started one up and,

177
00:08:39,695 --> 00:08:40,034
and

178
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,244
I don't think everyone recognizes

179
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:45,195
just kind of the legal implications of paying people.

180
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,650
Yeah, I mean, I'm no lawyer, so I'm not going to go too far into that topic.

181
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,590
If you're getting legal advice from this podcast, we have

182
00:08:52,859 --> 00:08:53,919
bigger problems

183
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,400
in that case. It really kind of depends on

184
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:02,289
world events, a company's feelings, it's very individual, you know,

185
00:09:02,299 --> 00:09:05,780
it may be restricted to the country and what's going on at the time.

186
00:09:05,789 --> 00:09:06,239
But,

187
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,409
you know, we,

188
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:12,739
at least in my experience we do our best to reward people for what they're finding.

189
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,159
Well, I think one thing people forget is

190
00:09:15,739 --> 00:09:18,820
there's a big difference between running like a bug bounty for a website

191
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:22,140
that whatever, you know, gets 10 or 100 reports a year

192
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,070
versus something like what, you know, github

193
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:27,789
or Red Hat or Apple are doing because, and so just for context, uh again,

194
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:30,039
because I was like Google stalking your bug band program

195
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,500
and you know, your total payouts are over $3 million.

196
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,119
Like, you know, there's,

197
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:39,200
and I'm looking at the page of like listing all the payouts for like the last,

198
00:09:39,489 --> 00:09:43,510
you know, 23 months. It's a, it's a lot of reports and

199
00:09:43,739 --> 00:09:43,789
I,

200
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:47,510
I guess one of my questions is how do we get across to people that like,

201
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,580
it's different at scale,

202
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,900
right? There's a big difference between 10, 100 and 1000 a year.

203
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:55,099
And like, because I, I'm assuming that github

204
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,580
is, you're in the roughly 100 to 1000 category for bug,

205
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,840
you know, which

206
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:05,080
like, how do you do that? Like, like team wise and process wise?

207
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,739
What, what do you do to make that work?

208
00:10:06,869 --> 00:10:09,900
Yeah. So we take a very human approach to it.

209
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:14,969
We know that there are bounds to what we're able to do within a work day, work week,

210
00:10:14,979 --> 00:10:15,539
et cetera.

211
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:16,500
And we just

212
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:20,049
take empathy into factor which is,

213
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:22,479
there's a human on the other side of the screen and

214
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,539
we're also a human on this side of the screen.

215
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:28,559
So the best that we can do is communicate and say,

216
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:33,590
hey, we're running behind or hey, we are looking at this or,

217
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,659
you know, in the times of the holidays,

218
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:39,789
we're taking some time to regenerate and let us

219
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:44,950
get back to you when we can. Here's a realistic time frame for us to get back to you.

220
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,109
You know, obviously

221
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:50,109
there's someone in every communication that doesn't feel

222
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:52,630
great about that situation and we just try and

223
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,080
manage expectations as best as possible.

224
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,909
Oh, I remember these conversations.

225
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,869
It's always a treat but, but no, I do agree with you.

226
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,150
I think the human angle is hugely important and I feel like

227
00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:08,989
the hacker, one community

228
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:14,190
has done a nice job of fostering that attitude amongst the hackers, which is great.

229
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,780
I, I give them a lot of credit for that. So, so let me, let me ask you, you manage a bug

230
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:21,979
but you also handle product security.

231
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,659
So what is your kind of weighted average of, of percentage coming of, of,

232
00:11:27,669 --> 00:11:31,489
I guess work coming in by, by a bug bounty versus

233
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:36,179
internal discovery and, and fixing? And I'm, I'm, I'd love to know,

234
00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:40,369
-- I don't have a good percentage on that. You can
-- guess wildly we're fine with that.

235
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,869
It's a, it's a good,

236
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,409
I would say for the product security incident response team,

237
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:48,309
we are seeing a lot of bounty reports as

238
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,989
well as internal reports and probably around 5050.

239
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,979
Wow, that's awesome. I mean, that means you have a pretty solid team.

240
00:11:54,989 --> 00:11:56,090
That means which is cool.

241
00:11:56,099 --> 00:12:01,400
So, ok, this, I want to now lead this into the inevitable discussion

242
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,250
that comes up when bug bounties and product security

243
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:06,400
are kind of tied together

244
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:07,299
is

245
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,090
I often hear

246
00:12:09,369 --> 00:12:11,559
people in public that

247
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:16,640
are claiming a bug bounty can be your product security.

248
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:20,590
You don't need an internal team necessarily doing this sort of work.

249
00:12:20,619 --> 00:12:23,559
Whereas we can we have a bug bounty we're covered.

250
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,679
I would love to hear your hot take on that

251
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:32,039
-- as
-- someone who has homegrown the bug bounty team here at

252
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,320
github actual physical team, we started that about two years ago at this point.

253
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:43,239
And so we were managing it through our product security team and it was working.

254
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:48,489
But for any program to mature, I think having dedicated resources is people who

255
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,919
understand the workflow and don't have to split their time or feel guilty that

256
00:12:54,099 --> 00:12:56,210
something takes more priority.

257
00:12:56,219 --> 00:13:01,169
It allows us to lean into that human aspect as well is getting people who truly care

258
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,969
about our program.

259
00:13:02,979 --> 00:13:08,080
I've got one report who I always say is the golden retriever of our team.

260
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,890
He loves everything bounty

261
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,840
and he is wonderful and it shows in the work that he does

262
00:13:15,099 --> 00:13:17,799
and having someone have to split their time.

263
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:22,039
You see things where there are difficulties in communication,

264
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:25,280
people get frustrated with the program, slow response times.

265
00:13:25,289 --> 00:13:28,460
So I think it's really important to have those dedicated resources.

266
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,299
And also one thing you just mentioned that

267
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,280
I've never considered about hacker one was that

268
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:32,969
like,

269
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,280
not only are you getting them to deal with

270
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:36,450
the hassles of like taxes and payments and like,

271
00:13:36,489 --> 00:13:39,260
like, because I, I've done cross border payments and with some countries,

272
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,500
it's just, it's ridiculous.

273
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,260
I don't understand.

274
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,760
You'd mentioned that essentially

275
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:43,799
between

276
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:44,760
like github,

277
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,669
actively coaching the people that come to github,

278
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:50,940
but in general, hacker one also fostering that community and sort of, well,

279
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:54,099
it sounds like kind of teaching them how to behave and how to be,

280
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:54,320
I

281
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,799
don't want to say responsible, not the word responsible, but maybe effective.

282
00:13:57,809 --> 00:13:59,309
And like that, that seems to be,

283
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,159
I think maybe one thing that I've been missing in the value of hacker one and,

284
00:14:02,369 --> 00:14:05,030
and the maturity piece of bug bounties in general

285
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:07,929
because again, at scale, right, you're not dealing with one or two reports,

286
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,109
you're dealing with hundreds.

287
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:10,039
And so I'm curious, like,

288
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:13,500
have you seen the industry mature or the researchers mature?

289
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,020
I should say,

290
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,840
definitely over my time, I've seen the researchers mature.

291
00:14:17,849 --> 00:14:22,000
I think one thing that was really impactful for our team in this last year is

292
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:27,789
we did our first solo focused live hacking event with hacker one back in June.

293
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,950
And so we got to

294
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:34,309
hang out with our researchers see how they interact with other researchers.

295
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,859
And you saw these friendships form this elevation of reports, people showing, hey,

296
00:14:39,869 --> 00:14:40,270
you know,

297
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,619
I always submit a video proof of concept versus

298
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,590
someone who may be extremely detailed in their writing.

299
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:51,179
And then you see those researchers band together and

300
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,909
create this wonderful report which is magical for us.

301
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:54,109
You know,

302
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:56,109
anything that can shave some time off the

303
00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:59,130
top by communicating more effectively is great.

304
00:14:59,140 --> 00:14:59,549
So

305
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:03,900
I think events like that events like hacker 1702,

306
00:15:03,909 --> 00:15:07,520
the Vegas event where there's multiple customers as the target.

307
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:12,210
-- It just brings that community together and fosters better
-- work.

308
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:16,059
I'm going to ask you to explain what a live hacking event

309
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:20,369
is like because I have attended live hacking events from hacker one

310
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:21,599
and they are

311
00:15:21,909 --> 00:15:25,890
incredibly interesting and just intense and amazing.

312
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:27,010
And my favorite

313
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,580
is every time they're like, oh, well, you should go meet the, the

314
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,179
the employees in the,

315
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:36,059
in the war room and you open the door and they just look at you with like get out now.

316
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:39,039
They're so busy and it's, it's so cool.

317
00:15:39,049 --> 00:15:42,369
So please like, I would love it if you could explain more for the people who have no,

318
00:15:42,469 --> 00:15:43,539
no idea what that even means.

319
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,200
Yeah.

320
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:50,179
So a live hacking event is a group of folks that are dedicated towards invited,

321
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:50,640
right?

322
00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:53,030
Yes, this was an invite only event.

323
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:57,570
So invitation for our researchers to come join us in person

324
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,919
or remotely because that's our world now.

325
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:06,760
And so we met up in Austin, but the two weeks before we opened the floodgates, we said,

326
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,909
hey, start hacking on our product.

327
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:12,559
And so we started getting a flood of reports in.

328
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,099
And thankfully,

329
00:16:14,169 --> 00:16:16,750
we had a little bit of a blocker of a day where we

330
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,880
could travel into Austin and not feel like we were running behind.

331
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,849
But the team hit the ground running.

332
00:16:22,859 --> 00:16:28,289
We went into a ballroom and we're all furiously, you know, hoods up, heads down,

333
00:16:28,489 --> 00:16:29,530
hacking away at

334
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:34,780
what everyone was sending us in. And then as you mentioned, it just got chaos.

335
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,989
I mean, it, you got a lot of reports in our case,

336
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,539
a small team and we were just trying to get through

337
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:43,609
everything and make sure that the day of the event,

338
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,119
we were able to

339
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:46,224
adjudicate everything,

340
00:16:46,234 --> 00:16:50,094
get everything a number to it so that the leader boards were accurate.

341
00:16:50,104 --> 00:16:51,575
Now at these events,

342
00:16:51,585 --> 00:16:53,424
there's a leader board that shows how much money you're

343
00:16:53,434 --> 00:16:56,794
getting reputation points in the case of hacker one.

344
00:16:56,804 --> 00:16:58,635
And at the end, we're able to

345
00:16:58,835 --> 00:17:00,195
give a rating.

346
00:17:00,205 --> 00:17:06,155
So most valuable hacker, some other rewards, uh, best report, things like that,

347
00:17:06,364 --> 00:17:10,155
I think covered most of the event without going too rambling on it.

348
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:11,640
Well, and,

349
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:16,010
and I want to clarify because this is the thing that I think was most bizarre to me

350
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:18,819
is there are two groups,

351
00:17:18,969 --> 00:17:23,060
there are the hackers and there are your people doing the triage work

352
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,079
and they're not necessarily talking to each other,

353
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:30,869
but they're both physically present at the event, which I, I find amazing.

354
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:31,569
Yeah.

355
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:32,550
So

356
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,849
we really wanted to focus on

357
00:17:35,949 --> 00:17:40,469
the valuable community aspect of getting everyone in the same space,

358
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:45,599
especially after, you know, two years of not being able to see people in person and,

359
00:17:45,609 --> 00:17:48,020
and break bread and just get to know someone.

360
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,770
So while we were hacking away in the other room,

361
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,390
we were making sure to send somebody out

362
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:58,459
one at a time to go interact or if we had questions

363
00:17:58,589 --> 00:18:00,619
pop over to the other room and try and

364
00:18:00,869 --> 00:18:02,890
discuss with the researcher because

365
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,579
it was valuable. We didn't have to send them a message.

366
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:09,569
We didn't have to wait 24 hours of time zone or whatever the case may be

367
00:18:09,699 --> 00:18:11,020
to get their answer.

368
00:18:11,229 --> 00:18:12,439
And so, um

369
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,890
in some cases, we had this renewed energy from researchers because they were like,

370
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,250
wow, you actually took the time to come chat with me and that's

371
00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:21,550
so important to

372
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:21,920
us.

373
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,359
There's so much fun.

374
00:18:24,454 --> 00:18:28,805
If anyone listening ever has a chance to attend one of the live hacking events,

375
00:18:28,964 --> 00:18:30,785
-- they're so much fun. You would not
-- regret it.

376
00:18:30,795 --> 00:18:32,795
I Well, part of me honestly, like if there was,

377
00:18:32,805 --> 00:18:35,714
if one of those happened close enough to me and like allowed an audience,

378
00:18:35,935 --> 00:18:38,285
like, you know, it's like going to Bliss con and watching Starcraft.

379
00:18:38,295 --> 00:18:40,474
Two professionals play Right. Like, no, seriously, I would

380
00:18:40,724 --> 00:18:45,314
like, I know I'm a minor subset of weirdos but, like, I would go watch.

381
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:46,430
But

382
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:48,329
that leads to my big question. So,

383
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,819
as I've understood it, the,

384
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:52,020
the premise of a bug bounty always is you

385
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,180
get security researchers coming into you reporting bugs,

386
00:18:54,189 --> 00:18:56,219
you fix them, your product is more secure.

387
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,310
Are you actually finding that to be the case?

388
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:02,930
Like, are you finding that there are less sort of in, I guess with github,

389
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,079
it's a little different because it's not like apple phones where, you know,

390
00:19:05,089 --> 00:19:08,739
they're finding zero days in the wild because bad people are trying to break into,

391
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,020
you know, journalist phones.

392
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,270
But with github,

393
00:19:11,459 --> 00:19:12,900
are you finding that,

394
00:19:13,189 --> 00:19:15,140
you know, well, for example,

395
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,280
Attackers are trying to exploit flaws and you're like,

396
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,869
ha ha we fixed that three months ago, you know,

397
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,810
because this nice person reported it to us properly, like, is it actually

398
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,869
impacting your security in a measurable way?

399
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,530
Oh, definitely.

400
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:32,380
I mean, we have, I believe over 94 million developers on our platform.

401
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:37,410
So being able to fix something ahead of time and fix something

402
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:41,189
that hasn't been exploited yet is so incredibly valuable to us.

403
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:45,560
You know, it protects us, it protects our users. You know, we run github

404
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,349
off of github,

405
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,270
so we definitely are the affected party there too.

406
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,229
That's awesome.

407
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:55,349
Your bug bounty is against the live sites.

408
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:57,550
You don't have like a secondary infrastructure

409
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,979
that you're asking people to mess with,

410
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:04,109
like, you've got people actually attacking github.com and all of that stuff.

411
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:09,140
Yep, especially at 2 a.m. or Friday at five. You know, those are my favorite.

412
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,300
Oh, yes, I bet.

413
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,890
-- What
-- is it with the Friday 5 p.m. security reports?

414
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,959
Like, like why are they always the worst?

415
00:20:17,459 --> 00:20:20,699
I don't know, there have been some weeks where I felt like tweeting out.

416
00:20:20,709 --> 00:20:24,660
Please stop sending Friday at five vulnerabilities. But, you know, I can't do that.

417
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:25,020
So

418
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:29,369
don't stop sending them in my team's around. We'll take care of it.

419
00:20:30,469 --> 00:20:31,979
Oh, yes, yes.

420
00:20:31,989 --> 00:20:36,469
I mean, but at the same time, you've also got what the, the infosec folks that are,

421
00:20:37,109 --> 00:20:39,170
you know, seeing all these attacks, I guess.

422
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,300
Ok, so this is a good question and this is something that I've,

423
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,260
it's a very difficult answer.

424
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:49,880
So you have the bug bounty people obviously doing their thing

425
00:20:49,989 --> 00:20:50,729
and you,

426
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:55,699
I imagine have some sort of like information security team that's doing like

427
00:20:55,709 --> 00:20:59,050
event monitoring and you have a SIM and all of that jazz.

428
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:03,180
So how does your internal security team, I guess.

429
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:04,670
How do they delineate?

430
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,689
What is an actual attack action needs to be taken on versus

431
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:11,300
what is probably the bug bunny people doing the bug bunny thing?

432
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:15,349
Yeah, we have a pretty good grasp.

433
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,229
I wouldn't say, you know, lock proof on that, but we do know

434
00:21:19,339 --> 00:21:23,410
the handles of most of our, our researchers, you know, coming to the platform.

435
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,469
So, you know,

436
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:28,050
we're always keeping an eye and we're always vigilant on those things.

437
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,989
So whether it is a bounty reporter or

438
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,310
potential malicious act activity, we're going to act the same way.

439
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:34,770
Now,

440
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,040
the communication may be different if we are very sure

441
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,540
that it's a researcher in our bug bounty program,

442
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,280
we may just confirm things, but

443
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,260
we're going to take the same action. We, we see there is something going on.

444
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,329
We're going to take care of it.

445
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,839
So that's interesting because it actually had not occurred to me that well,

446
00:21:50,849 --> 00:21:54,030
to be blunt, if I was going to test get.com, I would not use my account,

447
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,760
right? Because I don't want my account getting booted off or locked out or,

448
00:21:56,939 --> 00:21:57,790
I mean, fun fact.

449
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:02,229
I actually ran an ill behaved w get script once that I got my IP block from Cloudflare,

450
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:04,729
which meant I had to like reset my Mac address and

451
00:22:04,739 --> 00:22:07,219
get a new IP and stop testing stuff from home.

452
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:09,189
You actually have researchers that are like

453
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:12,630
doing their bug bounty activities like from their main account,

454
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,650
like live

455
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:17,550
a little bit of both, but usually that's communicated very well.

456
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,270
They're very forthright with that information typically. So

457
00:22:20,469 --> 00:22:21,949
-- yeah,
-- because I just for me,

458
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:26,099
like I said, it would have never occurred to me to use my actual real persona account,

459
00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:26,880
whatever you want to call it

460
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:27,449
to,

461
00:22:27,459 --> 00:22:28,969
to do this kind of testing because I just

462
00:22:28,979 --> 00:22:31,069
assume at some point I'm gonna get blocked out or

463
00:22:31,209 --> 00:22:35,189
-- whatever.
-- We should probably also clarify that when you use hacker one,

464
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,579
they have a special domain called we are,

465
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,689
is, is it we are, we are hacker one.com, right?

466
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:40,319
One.

467
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:40,849
Yeah.

468
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:45,790
Where it's expected that the researchers will create like an email address.

469
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,390
You know what like Kurt at, we are hacker one.com

470
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:49,229
and then

471
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,819
register that

472
00:22:50,939 --> 00:22:54,069
almost certainly as a separate account and then use that.

473
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:56,510
And that also is a way to signal

474
00:22:56,979 --> 00:23:01,449
to whoever is on the receiving end of this, that I am a researcher, you know,

475
00:23:01,459 --> 00:23:02,369
with good intent.

476
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,069
I'm not a bad guy from somewhere,

477
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:06,630
although I'm sure there's bad guys that do this too because they know it's,

478
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,969
it's camouflage, but that's a whole another conversation, I imagine.

479
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:10,630
Yeah,

480
00:23:10,979 --> 00:23:11,680
definitely.

481
00:23:14,449 --> 00:23:17,479
Oh, my goodness. Yes. Yes. That's so cool.

482
00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:22,819
Ok. All right. So I, I guess I have one kind of last question

483
00:23:22,989 --> 00:23:24,790
that, that's rattling around in my mind

484
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:25,800
is

485
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,819
you have a page on hacker one

486
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:33,300
that lists your bounty amounts

487
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:34,300
and

488
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,489
the low on the low end it's 2000, medium is 10,000,

489
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,829
high is 20,000 and critical is 30,000.

490
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:41,329
And like

491
00:23:41,469 --> 00:23:44,859
those are pretty solid amounts to be handing out.

492
00:23:44,869 --> 00:23:46,569
And, and do you know off the top of your head?

493
00:23:46,579 --> 00:23:50,699
Like what is, what kind of distribution do you see on those values? Is it,

494
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,770
are you mostly on the lower end?

495
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,979
Do you see a lot of reports do you get a lot of good criticals? I'm I'm curious,

496
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:59,819
-- I'd say
-- we have a pretty good smattering across the board. Um

497
00:24:00,175 --> 00:24:05,165
This past year we actually awarded our highest bounty ever, which was 50,000.

498
00:24:05,474 --> 00:24:10,675
There is a lovely blog post on our blog about that report.

499
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:13,314
Can you sum it up for us by chance,

500
00:24:13,444 --> 00:24:15,915
October of last year,

501
00:24:15,925 --> 00:24:21,474
we discovered that there was a vulnerability that an attacker

502
00:24:21,484 --> 00:24:24,704
could publish new versions of any M PM package.

503
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:25,555
Um

504
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,250
And so it allowed an attacker

505
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:31,869
to publish anything without proper authorization.

506
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,189
So we quickly validated that in good old bounty fashion,

507
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:39,369
our researchers went ahead and pulled on the strings there and were able to,

508
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,189
you know, get some other

509
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:43,390
vulnerabilities in the space

510
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:45,719
and we should clarify.

511
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:46,439
Github

512
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,819

518
00:25:00,609 --> 00:25:02,359
We've run ourselves out of time and Jill,

519
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:04,540
this has been an absolutely amazing conversation,

520
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,630

what you think the takeaway should be or whatever.

524
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,319
