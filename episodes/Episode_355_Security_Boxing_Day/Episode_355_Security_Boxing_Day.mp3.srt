Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt Siefried

1
00:00:09,789 --> 00:00:12,039
and my partner in opening presents, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:15,090
-- Are
-- we opening presents should have been opened by

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,969
now because it's totally Christmas Day or Boxing Day,

4
00:00:18,979 --> 00:00:21,350
depending upon where you live or depending upon what day you

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,670
-- listen to this
-- or if you celebrate Christmas at all.

6
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:24,870
That's true.

7
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:25,780
That's true.

8
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:30,659
So, today we're going to talk about Boxing Day,

9
00:00:30,819 --> 00:00:35,490
which is not a holiday familiar to, we'll say most of the world. Well, maybe it is.

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:35,939
I don't know

11
00:00:36,099 --> 00:00:38,279
-- if
-- you're a British colony. You are so.

12
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:41,840
Well, I mean, the United States is technically a British colony.

13
00:00:41,849 --> 00:00:43,380
-- We just
-- not anymore.

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,680
Who's on your money again.

15
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,419
No, no. Well, we're not part of the Commonwealth, right?

16
00:00:47,819 --> 00:00:49,520
Canada is part of the Commonwealth

17
00:00:49,693 --> 00:00:52,152
and I know the UK and at least Canada,

18
00:00:52,162 --> 00:00:54,233
probably some other places celebrate Boxing Day.

19
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:55,972
And now Kurt tell us what Boxing Day is

20
00:00:55,983 --> 00:00:58,693
because you actually experience Boxing Day and then we

21
00:00:58,702 --> 00:01:02,092
can talk about what Boxing Day used to be and how we're going to talk about that today.

22
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:06,152
So, modern Boxing Day. Well, it's essentially what we did instead of Black Friday.

23
00:01:06,163 --> 00:01:10,873
Right. It's our sales day now, although now we celebrate Black Friday here in Canada

24
00:01:11,053 --> 00:01:11,843
as well

25
00:01:12,365 --> 00:01:16,125
after Christmas. Why are you buying stuff after Christmas?

26
00:01:16,136 --> 00:01:18,555
After you just bought a bunch of crap and gave it to people?

27
00:01:18,725 --> 00:01:21,555
Yeah. Well, the traditional, because it's a holiday to go shopping.

28
00:01:21,786 --> 00:01:24,695
I mean, the traditional thing was that essentially it was when you, um,

29
00:01:24,755 --> 00:01:28,456
-- you gave your servants and whatnot gifts and such,
-- the,

30
00:01:28,466 --> 00:01:32,405
-- the less fortunate is the term we'll
-- use the old time.

31
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,255
You less fortunate.

32
00:01:33,555 --> 00:01:34,375
Right. Right.

33
00:01:35,115 --> 00:01:35,825
That's right.

34
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:37,856
That's right. Everyone but the wealthy.

35
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:39,330
Yeah. So,

36
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,089
but, yeah, I like many things now. It's just morphed into another shopping day.

37
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:42,709
Ok.

38
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:47,580
But here's what I want us to talk about today, which Kurt totally did his homework on,

39
00:01:47,589 --> 00:01:47,919
on that.

40
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:51,319
I gave him earlier in the week. I found out just a few minutes ago. But that's fine.

41
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,699
I'm deadline driven. That's right. Exactly.

42
00:01:53,949 --> 00:01:55,459
Gotten that one pretty close.

43
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:59,830
So there is a person at Wendy Nather who is, I,

44
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:03,459
I think she's in her title is like Advisory Ciso at Cisco or something like that.

45
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:07,489
But Wendy has this concept. She calls the Security Poverty Line where

46
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,690
she talks about how

47
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:14,699
we as security people love to go on and on about, oh, you need to do this and, and that,

48
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,669
-- and you need to go
-- buy $75 yi

49
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,449
keys and at least get at least two of them because the

50
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,440
and get a safe deposit box to keep it in and,

51
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,509
yeah, exactly. Patch your systems. Like there's so many things we spout

52
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:29,589
and the, the reality is the vast majority of organizations

53
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,250
don't have the resources. They don't have the time.

54
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:33,830
They just can't do anything about it.

55
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,949
And it's not that they don't want to.

56
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,910
And there's a good, is it, is it Neil Gaiman who wrote about the boots?

57
00:02:40,649 --> 00:02:43,229
Have you ever heard the Boots thing where it's basically like,

58
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,570
if you pay $100 for a good pair of boots, it'll last for 10 years.

59
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,210
But

60
00:02:47,529 --> 00:02:50,860
the poor people are paying like, what, $30 for a pair of boots that last,

61
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:52,839
like one year and they have to buy new boots every

62
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,100
year and their back hurts and all that stuff and I'll,

63
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,830
I'll find it and put a link in the show.

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,149
Oh, it was Terry Pratchett

65
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,429
-- in Men at Arms? Oh, Terry
-- Pratchett. Ok.

66
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:02,149
Right. Right. And so anyway,

67
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:03,789
you, you kind of get the idea.

68
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,520
And so something I was thinking about,

69
00:03:05,529 --> 00:03:09,369
we are the open source security podcast if someone

70
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,839
said I don't have a lot of resources,

71
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,360
but I want to improve the security of using open source,

72
00:03:16,369 --> 00:03:18,539
specifically open source because there are tons of

73
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,089
advice on just like general infosec and it,

74
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,820
and stuff like that.

75
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:25,039
But I was thinking we have a unique angle and so what would,

76
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,800
what would you tell someone if they came to you and said,

77
00:03:27,809 --> 00:03:29,130
I don't have a lot of resources.

78
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:33,160
I'm using open source. What can I do to, I guess,

79
00:03:33,369 --> 00:03:36,039
-- improve my life.
-- Honestly,

80
00:03:36,179 --> 00:03:39,360
I would say the first thing is kind of go with the, how do I say it?

81
00:03:39,369 --> 00:03:41,910
It's like the bigger branded open source if you're,

82
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:44,949
especially if it's something like you're relying on to get your job done,

83
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:50,949
you know, use something like ubuntu, not some crazy random obscure Linux distro.

84
00:03:51,089 --> 00:03:51,759
You know what?

85
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,259
I didn't write down anything like that,

86
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:57,039
but I think that's a very reasonable thing that anyone can do.

87
00:03:57,149 --> 00:03:58,589
-- It's just,
-- you're gonna have less hassle.

88
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,639
Like a perfect example of this is

89
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,910
there are versions of Linux

90
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:03,500
that

91
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:07,399
have things that would kind of benefit me for some of the things I do.

92
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:11,600
But I basically just force myself to use Ubuntu LTs long term support because

93
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,160
it might be a little more work upfront to get it to work,

94
00:04:14,369 --> 00:04:19,059
but it's way more sustainable and Ubuntu LTs is going to be around in five or 10 years.

95
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,660
So I have a, a better example of that I think.

96
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,850
And this will tie into, I've got containers are one of my things.

97
00:04:25,859 --> 00:04:27,130
We'll talk about that a little more in a minute.

98
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,970
But there are lots of container images and one of the favorite things. OK.

99
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,079
That's an understatement ba images,

100
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,929
whatever. Stop it, stop it. All right.

101
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:38,429
I know. I know. Anyway.

102
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,929
So there's all these bases images, right? And you've got like big fat images like

103
00:04:42,309 --> 00:04:44,630
bu you've got these really slim images like alpine

104
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:46,109
and there's everything in between.

105
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,230
And one of the hip things going on right now is people are becoming obsessed and this,

106
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:53,690
this like comes and goes constantly because a couple of years ago,

107
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,989
I remember this was huge news at redhead,

108
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,630
but people become obsessed with like we're

109
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,869
going to build the smallest possible container image

110
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,660
that only has what we want.

111
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,440
And it's usually driven by vulnerability scans where they're like, oh look,

112
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,429
my vulnerability has zero CV ES

113
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,660
which is a fool's errand and we'll talk about that some other day. But

114
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,190
you often get this. But the problem you have is if you take like a fat image like a

115
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,720
Buntu, it usually has the things you need to make it work, right?

116
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:22,230
And it'll usually not break very often.

117
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:26,369
Whereas when you have these like crazy custom distro list type things,

118
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,820
I'm not saying they're worse,

119
00:05:27,989 --> 00:05:33,769
but you've now shifted the burden onto to having to kind of feed and maintain it

120
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,679
at the creation time because now you're responsible for all

121
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,910
the tools you're responsible for everything going in it.

122
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,130
If you miss something,

123
00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:43,410
it might break for who knows what reason because it,

124
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,859
it's expecting some weird file in Etsy only on the

125
00:05:46,869 --> 00:05:49,450
first of the month when it runs billing or whatever.

126
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:51,089
And, and so I think

127
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,230
that is a very reasonable piece of advice.

128
00:05:54,239 --> 00:05:57,500
In my opinion, I know a lot of people will probably disagree with this,

129
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:01,230
but I think it buys you a certain amount of just boring

130
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:03,480
and boring is good in security.

131
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:04,440
Well, and to be clear,

132
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,049
this is not about fat or skinny containers

133
00:06:06,059 --> 00:06:07,329
because fat containers have their own problems.

134
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:10,359
Like stuff randomly goes away that you were depending on the

135
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:13,040
base image to have and that you didn't explicitly install.

136
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,420
Uh a great example is like I install Apache and

137
00:06:15,429 --> 00:06:16,970
then I tried using mod rewrite and I'm like,

138
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,890
it doesn't work.

139
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:18,440
What the

140
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:21,975
and I'm like, oh yeah, the module is not turned on by default. OK? I got it. Do that. Ok.

141
00:06:21,984 --> 00:06:22,375
Great.

142
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:25,225
What it is is it's about that sustainability of like,

143
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:28,934
I don't suddenly want a six months from now notice like I've gotten zero updates

144
00:06:29,234 --> 00:06:30,804
or worse, something

145
00:06:30,984 --> 00:06:33,404
like chrome or whatever app I'm using inside

146
00:06:33,415 --> 00:06:35,095
the container makes a change and it breaks

147
00:06:35,415 --> 00:06:37,515
and the container is just not kept up to date.

148
00:06:37,524 --> 00:06:40,774
Like I, I want my stuff to be kept up to date ideally by somebody else,

149
00:06:41,744 --> 00:06:42,135
right?

150
00:06:42,144 --> 00:06:45,815
And if you're using a lot of the distro list type stuff,

151
00:06:45,825 --> 00:06:49,285
it's often your responsibility to keep things updated

152
00:06:49,295 --> 00:06:51,364
because you're the one who's adding it and

153
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:54,329
we love to pin our dependencies because then things don't break.

154
00:06:54,869 --> 00:06:55,420
So

155
00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:00,609
it's so this one actually ties in nicely with, with the last thing I wrote down

156
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,750
which let me check my list here. I, I put in about kind of, uh, updating the software.

157
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,079
Right. Like you're using open source, it's a fire hose of updates.

158
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:13,290
And anyone, like, I run Fedora on my laptop, the laptop we're recording on right now

159
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,690
has Fedora on it

160
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,619
and every day I run DNF upgrade

161
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:18,489
and it

162
00:07:18,619 --> 00:07:23,279
just is, like, in hundreds and hundreds of things every single day. And

163
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,299
if you're running a desktop,

164
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:27,660
you should definitely turn on auto updates, right.

165
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:32,140
This is true of like any desktop Linux windows, like anything, turn that stuff on.

166
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:33,140
And actually there's,

167
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:37,260
there's actually a really subtle reason for this too is as the updates come out,

168
00:07:37,269 --> 00:07:39,980
there's a delta between your out of date system and

169
00:07:40,609 --> 00:07:41,709
upstream, let's call it

170
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,230
and that delta grows.

171
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:45,160
And so when you finally do an update,

172
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,359
because at some point you're gonna have to do an update

173
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:51,000
that if the delta is sufficiently large and you have any problems,

174
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,119
it's going to be a nightmare to track them down

175
00:07:53,369 --> 00:07:53,820
right

176
00:07:53,989 --> 00:07:54,220
now.

177
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,279
This is offset by the fact of or do you

178
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,920
accept the kind of constant pain of keeping your,

179
00:07:58,929 --> 00:08:00,359
basically, this is the difference between,

180
00:08:00,369 --> 00:08:03,179
do you clean your toilet every day and it only takes a minute to

181
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:06,390
clean because it's relatively clean because you cleaned it yesterday or do you,

182
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,440
you know, clean it monthly

183
00:08:07,859 --> 00:08:09,609
and then it takes like an hour of scrubbing, kind of,

184
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:09,880
right.

185
00:08:10,109 --> 00:08:12,559
But it's the same thing it's this kind of maintenance activity.

186
00:08:12,989 --> 00:08:16,630
Well, no, it's this kind of maintenance activity versus, you know, do you do a lot of

187
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,089
maintenance?

188
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:17,279
Do you

189
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:17,500
do the

190
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:19,359
right? And,

191
00:08:19,859 --> 00:08:21,920
and again, that's also, I would say

192
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,089
so in this case, that may or may not be appropriate because for example,

193
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,739
if you're supporting a manufacturing line,

194
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,480
you can't run the risk of breaking it every day.

195
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:31,040
You should probably do that on the weekends.

196
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:35,200
OK? So manufacturing lines are a different story and there's a part two

197
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,479
to what I wrote down

198
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:42,049
and the part two is not desktops. So if you're running like servers,

199
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,729
you don't want automatic updates.

200
00:08:44,739 --> 00:08:48,450
And anyone in in any kind of enterprise knows you have like

201
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:52,229
patch weekend or things like that where you on Friday at five

202
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,309
PM, you start upgrading systems because if you did this in the middle of the week,

203
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,000
you're going to get fired the next day because you're going to take down production.

204
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,799
And this is where containers come in because containers are kind of

205
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:05,599
a get out of jail free card when it comes to updates.

206
00:09:05,609 --> 00:09:07,880
Because I've got my old container that I know works.

207
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:11,679
I upgrade stuff in my container. I now have a new container,

208
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:14,200
I can test or deploy my new container.

209
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,280
And if it doesn't work, I just use my old container

210
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,820
because when you're dealing with actual servers,

211
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,739
if you upgrade a bunch of packages,

212
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,460
I know all of the distro claim they have rollback functionality.

213
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:30,049
-- That is a lie. Like I have never seen rollback actually work rollback
-- functioning.

214
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:33,869
Even when it does work, still doesn't fix the four hour email window outage

215
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,700
where nobody got me work done.

216
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,469
That's right. That's right. So,

217
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:39,219
so anyway, I, I feel like

218
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,479
that is one of the easiest things we can do

219
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,559
in terms of using open source is things like containers bring us

220
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,080
into a modern era that gives us a lot of power.

221
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,809
Most of us aren't running open

222
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:53,359
source like Linux or things on our desktops.

223
00:09:53,369 --> 00:09:55,719
I mean, that's just the reality of it and that's fine,

224
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:58,679
but no matter what you're running on your desktop, like auto update that sucker,

225
00:09:58,690 --> 00:09:59,359
you need it.

226
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,250
Well, actually, that really dovetails nicely with

227
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,299
my next, I don't want to call it prediction advice. And

228
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:08,299
the next thing you totally didn't just make up right now,

229
00:10:08,489 --> 00:10:10,390
which is no is to use github.

230
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,210
Now,

231
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:12,280
having said that

232
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,729
is one of the challenges with github used to be that you didn't have,

233
00:10:15,739 --> 00:10:17,859
you had to pay for private repos basically.

234
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:21,890
And they changed that like two maybe three years ago. It was, it's been a while.

235
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,419
So they have unlimited free public and private repos.

236
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:28,359
So for example, like I, I personally use them for tons of stuff.

237
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,950
We manage this podcast out of one

238
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:33,880
and I do actually use a handful of private repos,

239
00:10:33,969 --> 00:10:36,710
which is why I didn't realize when you click on a anyways.

240
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,549
But the thing is using github

241
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,659
gets you two things that are really important.

242
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:43,409
Number one, it gets you an off site backup of whatever you're shoving into github.

243
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:46,210
And number two, it gets you version and control, which means, oh,

244
00:10:46,219 --> 00:10:48,289
you delete something, you revert it,

245
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:49,429
right?

246
00:10:49,729 --> 00:10:50,260
And

247
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:52,159
also collaboration and sharing.

248
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,039
So it gets you three things, right?

249
00:10:54,049 --> 00:10:56,280
And collaboration and sharing is actually, you know,

250
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:58,440
that's the reason Google Drive took off, you know,

251
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,659
and Microsoft finally caught up and is there now, but

252
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:04,549
like for about four or five years, Microsoft didn't have office collaboration.

253
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:08,780
And you know, Google Drive really took over the world because of that,

254
00:11:08,979 --> 00:11:11,809
you know, it's weird but it turns out people want to be able to work together.

255
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,510
Maybe that's why companies are a thing.

256
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,000
Do you remember when we used to just like email

257
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:19,000
word documents to each other over and over again?

258
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,229
I still deal with some groups that email the word dog with change

259
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:27,260
track enabled and then some poor person has to manually reconcile it.

260
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,469
I'd take change tracking in a second.

261
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:32,979
I remember it just being people saying, oh, the document I sent on Tuesday,

262
00:11:32,989 --> 00:11:33,820
that's the one you want.

263
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:37,650
It's like you sent three documents on Tuesday. Like this is insane.

264
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,789
Well, and it's funny because like,

265
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:41,359
so my son is taking technology as one of his options and they're doing

266
00:11:41,369 --> 00:11:42,780
some basic programming in this sort of

267
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:45,739
like extended javascript uh Js five something.

268
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:51,010
It's like basically think logo, he was emailing himself his code to keep it safe,

269
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,349
right?

270
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:54,940
And I'm like, well, number one, that's actually a really good valid strategy.

271
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:55,729
Number two,

272
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:57,489
you already have a github account.

273
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,789
Let's teach you how to, like, I'm going to start teaching him how to use it.

274
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,500
But do they allow github at his school?

275
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:05,619
They allow the web at his school and it's a single file so

276
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,229
-- you can just cut and paste it so
-- he can get to github

277
00:12:08,469 --> 00:12:09,090
website?

278
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,140
Ok. Because

279
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:14,809
at, at the high school, my son goes to where I help with the robotics team,

280
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,630
they've blocked github

281
00:12:15,739 --> 00:12:18,229
because it apparently has naughty content on it. Well,

282
00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:19,650
yeah, because it's like Wikipedia,

283
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,650
-- it's
-- github.

284
00:12:21,719 --> 00:12:23,450
No, Wikipedia is allowed. Ok?

285
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,530
Because Wikipedia definitely there's some articles in there that are like, whoa,

286
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:30,770
nothing about the way they block content at schools makes sense.

287
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:31,409
It's

288
00:12:31,515 --> 00:12:36,846
obviously random nonsense and for whatever reason, someone decided this is bad.

289
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,995
-- And so now it's bad and there's no way to change it. Two
-- challenges.

290
00:12:40,005 --> 00:12:40,185
One,

291
00:12:40,195 --> 00:12:43,335
you're trying to solve a social problem with technology that almost never works.

292
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,135
-- It literally never works
-- well.

293
00:12:45,145 --> 00:12:47,885
Some things like self driving cars will hopefully deal with drunk drivers

294
00:12:47,995 --> 00:12:50,765
assuming the self driving cars ever work. But that remains to be seen.

295
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:51,835
And number two,

296
00:12:52,056 --> 00:12:53,416
I forget what number two was.

297
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:56,591
-- Oh,
-- you have

298
00:12:56,601 --> 00:12:58,731
-- to
-- be seen to be doing something. The goalkeeper's dilemma. Right.

299
00:12:58,742 --> 00:13:01,892
So even if it's an ineffective thing, we, we tried.

300
00:13:02,711 --> 00:13:03,661
So, yeah, so use github

301
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:05,401
with the caveat being, you know, don't abuse it.

302
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:08,502
Like don't shove 100 megabyte files in there or get repos that are over a gigabyte.

303
00:13:08,512 --> 00:13:11,901
And if you do that, you'll have to pay like five bucks a month for the data packs

304
00:13:12,151 --> 00:13:13,752
because we actually do like, I use github

305
00:13:13,892 --> 00:13:15,661
for backing up some stuff for the CS A.

306
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:20,309
And so we just pay like it's like $10 a month for the extra data storage. It's

307
00:13:20,739 --> 00:13:21,460
-- super worth
-- it

308
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:22,510
-- anyway.
-- All right.

309
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:23,840
Moving on, moving on.

310
00:13:24,109 --> 00:13:24,929
I have

311
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,510
the next thing.

312
00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:28,159
Actually, my next, I,

313
00:13:28,169 --> 00:13:31,359
I've got two more things I wrote down that I'm going to just smoosh them together.

314
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,289
So it's,

315
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:36,270
it's around when you're developing software kind of knowing

316
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,479
what you have and understanding what's critical path because

317
00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:42,770
if you are building anything today,

318
00:13:43,044 --> 00:13:45,395
you have thousands of dependencies.

319
00:13:45,744 --> 00:13:47,674
Right? There's just no way around that.

320
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:52,554
And there's always, now you run into how do I update things? What do I do? Do?

321
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,515
I just run current and go with it?

322
00:13:54,525 --> 00:13:57,265
Do I pin everything and, and figure out what to upgrade?

323
00:13:57,275 --> 00:14:00,705
And when, and if we're talking about organizations that aren't over

324
00:14:00,835 --> 00:14:01,534
resourced,

325
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,900
I think you've got the,

326
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:08,229
the kind of the three problems of do I update everything quickly.

327
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,119
Do I pin everything and pray?

328
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:14,000
And then I also need to know what I have, which is just kind of part of all of this.

329
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,010
And I think it's, it

330
00:14:15,219 --> 00:14:19,619
is hard to do and it's easy to say just oh go oh generate an S bomb and store it.

331
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:23,200
But like generating S bombs is hard and knowing what to do with them is hard

332
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:26,250
and pinning dependencies creates challenges.

333
00:14:26,349 --> 00:14:29,530
-- Running current creates challenges, you know.
-- Uh I have to,

334
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:32,619
I was just thinking one thought is if you're under-resourced,

335
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:35,159
anytime you do want to do something,

336
00:14:35,169 --> 00:14:39,450
you have to have a very strong and like easy to understand reason for doing it to get,

337
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,330
you know, approval.

338
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:40,650
Right?

339
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,565
And so that actually is almost one advantage of pinning dependencies.

340
00:14:44,575 --> 00:14:48,344
So it's now it's like I have to fix the CV versus oh,

341
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,645
I just want to spend 10 minutes every day, updating stuff.

342
00:14:50,655 --> 00:14:53,674
So it stays up to date. We don't have any big problems. Well, is it critical right now?

343
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,695
No. OK. Don't do that, do something else.

344
00:14:55,705 --> 00:14:57,575
So I think maybe that's part of, I,

345
00:14:57,594 --> 00:14:59,895
I don't want to say I'm in favor of penning dependencies,

346
00:14:59,905 --> 00:15:02,294
but it's one of the arguments you can use to support it.

347
00:15:02,849 --> 00:15:04,590
Yeah. Well, and I mean, so

348
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,809
if we un untangled this even more though you just said, oh, I have to fix the CBE.

349
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,210
If you're not well resourced,

350
00:15:10,219 --> 00:15:12,640
you don't even know you have security vulnerabilities,

351
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,030
you probably don't have any insight into what you're doing.

352
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:15,950
And

353
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:20,640
I think that's getting better because, like, if you look at N PM and PP,

354
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:25,000
they now have the ability to at least, like, warn you about old crap.

355
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:27,219
It'll, there's what an audit command that'll tell you.

356
00:15:27,229 --> 00:15:28,750
Like, these are the vulnerabilities.

357
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,159
They've, they've had built in packages that use their, like,

358
00:15:31,169 --> 00:15:33,229
security databases for years now.

359
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,320
Um, and I think now it's actually becoming, yeah,

360
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,840
it's kind of becoming more of a default built in as opposed to something you can,

361
00:15:38,849 --> 00:15:40,559
you have to like actually try to use.

362
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:42,559
I agree with that.

363
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:43,609
Well, and just like, I mean,

364
00:15:43,619 --> 00:15:45,599
in line with that would be like enabling um

365
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,929
I'm spacing out what is it called in github?

366
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,099
The security

367
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,239
tracker.

368
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:50,000
Depend,

369
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,239
-- that's the one. Yeah. So,
-- OK,

370
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,059
so depend

371
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:53,260
AOT

372
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,219
is a cool tool but depend

373
00:15:55,419 --> 00:15:55,440
AOT

374
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:58,520
is also it, it generates a lot of work

375
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:02,580
because it's gonna constantly try to upgrade your dependencies.

376
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:04,989
And if you don't have good tests, depend

377
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:05,200
aot

378
00:16:05,349 --> 00:16:05,809
is

379
00:16:05,929 --> 00:16:05,989
I

380
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,909
thought you could have depend,

381
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,539
just send you warnings but not actually do

382
00:16:08,549 --> 00:16:10,099
-- anything because
-- that's what you can have it,

383
00:16:10,109 --> 00:16:13,609
send you warnings, but it can be very noisy but it also try, you can, it'll

384
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,940
so the way to, you know, we should clarify this because not everyone might know this.

385
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,010
So you've got this tool github

386
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,000
wrote called Depend A bo

387
00:16:19,585 --> 00:16:23,906
Depend A bot will try to look at your project, figure out what your dependencies are

388
00:16:24,015 --> 00:16:25,536
and then tell you when things are out of date.

389
00:16:25,546 --> 00:16:26,265
It's very cool,

390
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:30,185
but it'll what to upgrade and when to upgrade it is always a challenge.

391
00:16:30,195 --> 00:16:31,286
Obviously, you can have depend

392
00:16:31,495 --> 00:16:35,416
bot try to send like, pull requests to automatically update certain things.

393
00:16:35,426 --> 00:16:39,406
But obviously you need tests to know like is this,

394
00:16:39,562 --> 00:16:41,822
can I upgrade this thing without blowing everything up?

395
00:16:41,831 --> 00:16:46,341
Because like, especially in the N PM ecosystem, you can upgrade a package

396
00:16:46,492 --> 00:16:49,981
that will then upgrade like 300 things beneath it

397
00:16:50,512 --> 00:16:51,382
and then

398
00:16:51,651 --> 00:16:53,981
it might have a different API or it might

399
00:16:53,992 --> 00:16:56,242
behave differently and you might not know it.

400
00:16:56,252 --> 00:16:57,822
Right. I mean, this is just, this is,

401
00:16:58,211 --> 00:16:59,581
you know, it's how it works.

402
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:00,299
Uh

403
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:04,108
I remember so many things updating things and

404
00:17:04,118 --> 00:17:06,900
config files would or would not change or,

405
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,699
well, you wouldn't want to change the config file,

406
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:11,270
but there were new capabilities that you wanted to pull into.

407
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:13,630
It's,

408
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:16,229
it's difficult and tough and there's

409
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:20,800
again, if you're beneath that security poverty line, defend a bot

410
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:24,719
probably isn't particularly valuable to you because it's going to create a

411
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,520
huge pain in your butt.

412
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:29,540
Yeah. Right. And so you're just not going to do it

413
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,439
and now you have a situation of,

414
00:17:31,449 --> 00:17:33,959
you don't know what you have and you don't know what to do with it.

415
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:34,400
And,

416
00:17:34,729 --> 00:17:39,430
and this 10 man, like I think about this one a lot and just, I, I don't know

417
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,619
what to tell people. You know, it's easy to say,

418
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:42,800
know what you're running.

419
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:43,849
One aspect of this is,

420
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:45,520
is maybe unable to depend upon and have an

421
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,439
email filter rule that just archives it all.

422
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,280
So that like, uh for example,

423
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,319
when the cloud security lines was using Amazon web services,

424
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:52,449
I one day turned on cloud trade.

425
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:55,250
The next day I looked at what was in there and it was like, wow,

426
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,069
like literally a million events.

427
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,469
I'm like, I have no idea what to do with this.

428
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,400
And so I just left it running for three years

429
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,329
because it's,

430
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:08,569
it's, it's logging of events in your Aws, like everything, like every web request,

431
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:09,849
every S3 bucket request.

432
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:10,609
Like it's

433
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,939
a fire hose of, of X of

434
00:18:13,229 --> 00:18:15,130
JSON or XML files in, in S3.

435
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,920
And I left it running and I ignored it for a couple of years

436
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,550
until we left Amazon and then I deleted it and

437
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,589
it was just there to have as a record.

438
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,229
Well, because it costs like five bucks a month or whatever. Right?

439
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,869
And so I just, I had this like archive of logs

440
00:18:28,979 --> 00:18:32,260
that if I ever need them, I have them and stuff like this has saved me like,

441
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,750
thank goodness Google logs,

442
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,189
everything exhaustively because like we had somebody get a new Huawei phone

443
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,040
and it's like, oh,

444
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,569
your local calendar is blank in this remote calendar you want

445
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:42,250
to sync with has a whole bunch of stuff in it.

446
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,489
Let me reconcile that.

447
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,180
And so

448
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,369
in four minutes, it deleted one of our main calendars

449
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,930
and literally, you know, somebody's like, Kurt, do, we just get hacked.

450
00:18:49,939 --> 00:18:50,859
And I'm like, what?

451
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,209
He's like, the calendars are all blank and I'm like, that's not right.

452
00:18:54,219 --> 00:18:57,250
And so I look at the logs and I'm like, ok, this IP address in this country.

453
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,430
Do we have somebody there? Yes, we do.

454
00:18:58,439 --> 00:19:00,650
Hey, can you, have you done anything new recently?

455
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,369
And he's like, yeah, I just got a new phone. I'm like, ah,

456
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,310
and luckily I was able to roll it back and fix it but, you know,

457
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,500
without those logs and everything,

458
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,180
yeah, my life would have been very

459
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,579
unpleasant because as it turns out there's no way to back up Google calendar stuff.

460
00:19:11,589 --> 00:19:12,219
Really.

461
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:16,619
It's not like Google Drive where you can shove it into, like, some service.

462
00:19:16,869 --> 00:19:18,459
Google calendar is just,

463
00:19:19,229 --> 00:19:20,300
yeah, good luck with that.

464
00:19:20,729 --> 00:19:22,780
So, wait, how did you get the Google Calendar back?

465
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:25,670
Ah, they had just implemented the trash bin functionality, like,

466
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,489
three months before.

467
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,609
So I went into the account, went to the trash bin. I went, yep. There's everything.

468
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:31,819
Thank goodness that the app doesn't know how to empty

469
00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:33,589
the trash bin or I would have been like,

470
00:19:33,699 --> 00:19:34,780
well, everybody,

471
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,339
you get to manually recreate your calendars.

472
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:38,849
Yeah.

473
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,229
Well, and I still love, like, I just had somebody email me.

474
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:43,339
Can you please remove me from a Google calendar?

475
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,729
And I'm like, no, because I can't search for you.

476
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,729
Like, you can't search Google calendar items for an email address,

477
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,069
even in your own,

478
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:52,630
let alone somebody else's

479
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,770
man. No, we're not talking about

480
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,250
calendaring. Calendaring is a rathole and

481
00:19:57,459 --> 00:19:57,650
it

482
00:19:58,119 --> 00:19:59,890
will always be terrible because,

483
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,390
-- but it
-- was worse 10 years ago.

484
00:20:01,689 --> 00:20:03,130
It was a lot worse

485
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:04,969
anyway. Anyway.

486
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:05,839
Ok.

487
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,780
So security poverty line.

488
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:11,369
And I think you, you just hit on a really important point that

489
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,250
II I

490
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,329
think is valuable to all of us.

491
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:16,930
It's easy to say you need to monitor all your infrastructure.

492
00:20:16,939 --> 00:20:18,790
It's easy to say you need to monitor all your open

493
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:22,869
source. It's easy to talk about all this stuff. And I think one of the tricks

494
00:20:23,224 --> 00:20:25,834
maybe if you don't have a lot of resources isn't

495
00:20:25,844 --> 00:20:28,194
about fretting over what you're monitoring or not monitoring,

496
00:20:28,204 --> 00:20:32,694
but just make sure you have those kind of logs available for if you ever need them

497
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:34,915
and you might not even be the one who needs them.

498
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:37,175
Like for example, let's say you get epically hacked,

499
00:20:37,425 --> 00:20:39,734
you can call an organization

500
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,540
that will help you

501
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,880
just kind of untangle, right?

502
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:47,380
And, and figure out what happened and if you have those logs, they can,

503
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,199
they have tooling,

504
00:20:48,209 --> 00:20:51,479
they can use that on same thing with your open source dependencies.

505
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,939
If you're using something like

506
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,739
github and you're tracking your source code, you can look back in time

507
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,469
and say like this is where we picked this thing up

508
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:02,469
and I know something happened here at this other date.

509
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:04,209
And this is when we start seeing these weird

510
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:06,959
changes in our logs or whatever and you can,

511
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:08,780
you can start putting pieces together.

512
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:12,030
And I think that is very valuable and it's

513
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,150
not expensive from a resource or time perspective.

514
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,310
Like a perfect example of this is I, you know, I have

515
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,310
security cameras at my house and I hadn't mounted the one above the garage door yet.

516
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:22,880
And of course, that's when my, you know,

517
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,959
the neighbor smashes his pickup truck into my garage.

518
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:27,079
And,

519
00:21:27,469 --> 00:21:28,060
you know, and the

520
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,920
like, and unfortunately the doorbell camera didn't catch it.

521
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,319
But yeah, I mean, that would have made like the cops were just like,

522
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,089
oh, he's like, literally said, I think something like, oh,

523
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:37,520
that would have been so nice to have.

524
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,609
And I'm like, yeah, I imagine,

525
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:43,150
you know, and now, yeah, so it's just,

526
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,989
yeah, you're probably never going to need it.

527
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,569
But it's a lot like toilet paper in that. If you need it, you need it.

528
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:52,400
Why do you keep using bathroom analogies today?

529
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,599
-- That's
-- so weird because everybody has a bathroom.

530
00:21:55,109 --> 00:21:58,619
-- It's Christmas.
-- You know, my favorite thing is my favorite Christmas story.

531
00:21:58,689 --> 00:22:02,020
I did a contract in Argentina writing tech documentation

532
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,660
and I happened to get there

533
00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:06,189
the week they were doing the national census.

534
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,540
And so what's interesting is I get counted in the

535
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,060
census because I'm in the country and I'm like,

536
00:22:10,069 --> 00:22:11,400
really OK, that makes sense

537
00:22:11,589 --> 00:22:13,420
because, you know, at any point in

538
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,520
most countries you're gonna have thousands, tens of thousands,

539
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,060
he even millions of foreigners.

540
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,030
Right.

541
00:22:19,489 --> 00:22:19,989
You know.

542
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:23,969
And so what was, and then so the next day when I went to the office there was another

543
00:22:24,199 --> 00:22:26,170
there that was actually there, like, permanently

544
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,829
and his Spanish, uh, wasn't so good.

545
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:31,609
And so he's trying to, you know, figure out the census for him and he's like,

546
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:32,829
reading it and he's like, ok, like

547
00:22:32,939 --> 00:22:35,290
something, something in your bathroom. I'm like, yeah, that makes sense.

548
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:35,760
He's like,

549
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:37,640
it says a bucket. I'm like,

550
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,229
yeah,

551
00:22:38,449 --> 00:22:41,189
and in his mind he just didn't compute like, why,

552
00:22:41,199 --> 00:22:42,930
why would you have a bucket in your bathroom?

553
00:22:42,939 --> 00:22:46,119
And I'm like, well, hm, let's explain, you know, poverty to you.

554
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,030
Right.

555
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:50,329
Right. And so, but that's the thing, like, no matter what,

556
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,140
everybody has a bathroom or some sort

557
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:54,670
of bathroom situation figured out because we're humans

558
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:56,800
anyway.

559
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,739
Oh, my goodness.

560
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,430
This is, but this is like tech now, like,

561
00:23:00,439 --> 00:23:02,339
I have to give that talk at Career Day on Thursday

562
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,689
and I'm pointing out that one of the aspects of it now.

563
00:23:04,699 --> 00:23:10,030
No one knows the context of that. You told me that before we hit record. Explain this.

564
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,290
Yeah. So, but anyway, so I'm giving it a career day talk about it.

565
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:16,900
And one of the main points I'm making about it is that it is everything now.

566
00:23:16,949 --> 00:23:18,760
-- It's not like
-- this is no.

567
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,660
-- Ok. And
-- that's just like the security power

568
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:22,030
-- everything.
-- So

569
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,905
stop it. I'm going to give context. Then you can explain this. Kurt has a son

570
00:23:27,035 --> 00:23:27,885
at a school.

571
00:23:28,584 --> 00:23:32,885
Ok. Right. You have two sons. They go to school. There is Career Day at the school

572
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:36,834
and you volunteered to talk about it at Career Day.

573
00:23:37,285 --> 00:23:38,915
That is the context of that.

574
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,875
And one of the big points I make is that it is everything now.

575
00:23:41,925 --> 00:23:45,655
-- It
-- absolutely
-- is like we shoved a computer and everything, you know,

576
00:23:46,214 --> 00:23:49,305
and, and, and also I also make the point that you don't have to do.

577
00:23:49,314 --> 00:23:52,665
I like, you don't have to be in it full time to do it. Like there's also,

578
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,689
you can also end up being the person who like

579
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:57,390
is good with computers who people go to first.

580
00:23:57,849 --> 00:23:59,199
And that's the worst person

581
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:00,280
in

582
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,050
the world.

583
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,530
But that's also like, as I point out,

584
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,579
that's a very valuable thing to be and

585
00:24:05,589 --> 00:24:08,369
people love people who can solve their problems.

586
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,900
And so if you can learn to like,

587
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,250
you know, grin and bear it,

588
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,290
I can't condone that advice at all.

589
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,219
I think this is literally the tail end

590
00:24:19,229 --> 00:24:21,910
of Christmas that this episode is being published.

591
00:24:21,939 --> 00:24:23,859
Many of us will have been subjected to

592
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:26,900
our relatives tech questions for multiple days.

593
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,329
At this point, we fixed,

594
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:33,390
who knows how many printers and we are fed up with anyone using computers.

595
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:34,000
I

596
00:24:34,449 --> 00:24:38,239
I detest going to visit family because they

597
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:41,329
inevitably asked me to fix their computer every time

598
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:46,109
this is why we made our, like, we made my parents get Macs and iphones,

599
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:47,989
-- I made
-- my parents get a chromebook.

600
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,599
That's also an acceptable

601
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:53,510
answer. And it's funny, I actually point that out explicitly in my slides that

602
00:24:53,689 --> 00:24:55,810
like this is one of the reasons why Edmonton public School

603
00:24:55,819 --> 00:24:58,630
board is a chrome shop because I get all these,

604
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,989
it, like all these kind of basic, it functions that maybe you can end up doing.

605
00:25:02,214 --> 00:25:04,744
They can also be like, just we use chromebooks.

606
00:25:05,655 --> 00:25:09,594
Yep. No, I totally get it. In fact, that's always my advice.

607
00:25:09,604 --> 00:25:12,185
How do I, when my, my computer is broken, how do I fix it?

608
00:25:12,194 --> 00:25:14,155
I'm like, get a chromebook or buy a Mac.

609
00:25:14,165 --> 00:25:17,234
Those are usually my two bits of advice because although honestly,

610
00:25:17,244 --> 00:25:22,324
Windows I think has gotten better, I will say it's not the virus ridden cesspool.

611
00:25:22,334 --> 00:25:26,785
-- It once was, it's not great, but it's better.
-- Windows

612
00:25:26,974 --> 00:25:29,795
with Windows. Defender is pretty

613
00:25:30,469 --> 00:25:32,800
like Defender built in and it doesn't,

614
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:36,079
the biggest thing is it doesn't break the system like most A V will.

615
00:25:36,089 --> 00:25:38,770
Right. Right. Which is not a very high bar to set for a V.

616
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,739
It's like, does this make my system worse? No. Hey, that's the one I want.

617
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:43,010
Well, you know,

618
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:46,819
the funny thing about that is the Windows defender definitely kind of blows.

619
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,979
It catches the easy stuff. Right.

620
00:25:48,989 --> 00:25:54,140
But the thing is like 99% of this crap, your family's gonna pick up is the easy stuff.

621
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:57,400
You know what the biggest thing I think for a lot of people

622
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,579
is just two simple things. One

623
00:25:59,699 --> 00:26:03,339
use the web interface for your email, right? Like gmail, whatever.

624
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:04,829
And number two use

625
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,939
like use Chrome or whatever with an ad blocker.

626
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,479
The with an ad blocker,

627
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:12,270
I can't use the internet without ad blockers.

628
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,939
Although I would say use Firefox these days because the chrome

629
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:17,550
ad blocker is starting to suck because they've crippled it.

630
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,390
Um For some reason, no one understands why

631
00:26:19,699 --> 00:26:21,650
it's not to protect advertising revenue at all,

632
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,800
-- which is 80 something percent of their money,
-- right?

633
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:27,609
But Firefox with an ad blocker is delight. This is a delightful experience.

634
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,550
An ad blocker.

635
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:31,989
Yeah. Well, well, but it is

636
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:32,560
less

637
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,880
so with chrome because I was using Chrome for

638
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,229
a while because the people at work were like,

639
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:36,250
oh,

640
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:40,170
you have to use chrome to access some stupid website we have and I gave up and I'm like,

641
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,489
whatever I can just run Chrome for this one thing

642
00:26:42,729 --> 00:26:45,099
because the ad blocker like just doesn't block a

643
00:26:45,109 --> 00:26:46,770
-- lot of stuff and it's getting less
-- effective.

644
00:26:47,569 --> 00:26:50,329
That's why everyone run Firefox and it's open source

645
00:26:50,829 --> 00:26:54,810
except the persona profile management is still terrible, which I don't understand

646
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:55,400
it.

647
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:58,319
It is not very good and I will agree with you,

648
00:26:58,329 --> 00:27:00,880
but it is good enough that I can suffer through it.

649
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:03,770
And the advantages of having a functional ad

650
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:07,599
blocker vastly outweigh the negatives of the,

651
00:27:07,609 --> 00:27:08,670
the profile management.

652
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,819
-- Yep,
-- that is true.

653
00:27:10,775 --> 00:27:12,635
I can not live without a blocking because no,

654
00:27:12,645 --> 00:27:15,645
like every time I use the internet on somebody else's device,

655
00:27:15,655 --> 00:27:17,675
I'm just like the hell is wrong.

656
00:27:17,694 --> 00:27:18,314
Oh, right.

657
00:27:18,714 --> 00:27:18,724
I

658
00:27:18,905 --> 00:27:18,925
know

659
00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:23,194
-- this is what it looks like.
-- It's unbelievable. Anyway, anyway. All right.

660
00:27:23,204 --> 00:27:24,675
Do you have one more thing on your list?

661
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,234
We can probably bank through one more of these.

662
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:27,589
Uh

663
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,199
I had those two things. I was actually

664
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:31,359
gonna

665
00:27:31,489 --> 00:27:33,050
say this is a really open source. But

666
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:36,869
ok, so if you had a box of family photos that you really deeply treasured,

667
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,709
would you be willing to pay $2 a month to make sure it's backed up?

668
00:27:39,939 --> 00:27:41,739
Probably. So here's the thing

669
00:27:42,069 --> 00:27:45,390
when you go home for the Christmas or with friends and family,

670
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,250
make sure they're ok by default iphones and Apple

671
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,750
World and the Android phones of the Google World,

672
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,459
get 15 gigs of data storage,

673
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,219
right for free.

674
00:27:55,449 --> 00:27:57,979
So pay the extra $2 a month to get the 100 gigabytes

675
00:27:57,989 --> 00:28:00,300
or whatever so that all your photos and videos are backed up,

676
00:28:00,489 --> 00:28:02,959
that's actually good advice and it's not open source related,

677
00:28:02,969 --> 00:28:05,150
but I think the pictures are a big one.

678
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,189
Now.

679
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:09,349
It's not that simple always though because you can be a Google paying

680
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:12,689
customer and if you violate their terms of service in some way,

681
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,949
you can just lose your account and you can lose all your old

682
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:18,040
-- photos because like
-- you can also lose it by being a free customer.

683
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,400
-- And,
-- and absolutely,

684
00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:21,430
this is,

685
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:26,010
this is why actually the right way to do this is to have multiple copies where you can,

686
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:29,430
for example, like on my Mac, I have all my photos downloaded,

687
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,650
-- but
-- this assumes that the person is rich enough to afford another computer.

688
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,130
And, and that's a good point. A lot of people just have a mobile

689
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:36,530
phone.

690
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,359
Like, I,

691
00:28:37,369 --> 00:28:40,079
I have a friend who works at the government of Alberta and

692
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:43,310
she works with people who don't have a home computer anymore.

693
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:44,219
They just have their go,

694
00:28:44,229 --> 00:28:46,719
a issued cell phone which they use for all their personal stuff,

695
00:28:46,729 --> 00:28:48,680
which for the love of God don't do that.

696
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:52,310
Um, because one person was retiring and they pointed out like,

697
00:28:52,589 --> 00:28:54,010
you can't keep the phone number,

698
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,050
I suppose

699
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,729
you've been using it for 10 years and it's not yours. Wow. That sucks.

700
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,920
Well, don't use your work phone for personal stuff.

701
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:03,050
I mean, that's fair, especially when you work for the government.

702
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,849
But so I, I don't like,

703
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,369
yes.

704
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,969
And this is a perfect example of, like,

705
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:09,869
I like the advice and theory of having multiple copies and off site and blah, blah,

706
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,119
blah.

707
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:10,969
Yeah,

708
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:15,829
-- you're right. You're absolutely right.
-- But for many people, the $2 a month it auto.

709
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:16,099
So

710
00:29:16,229 --> 00:29:17,339
you don't have to do anything.

711
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,869
That's fair. That's a good point

712
00:29:19,089 --> 00:29:22,089
-- I had. Yeah. Oh, man, because,
-- like, I'm, I'm in the same boat.

713
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:23,140
Like I've literally got,

714
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:26,099
I it's on my to do list of setting up a thing where basically I will have my

715
00:29:26,109 --> 00:29:30,319
Windows or Mac download my ihos and copy it out and archive it and back it up.

716
00:29:30,329 --> 00:29:30,739
But like,

717
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:35,599
it's actually really difficult to do to ensure that all the photos get actually

718
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:39,030
backed up versus some because I just did an export of the directory.

719
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,479
And I'm like,

720
00:29:39,859 --> 00:29:41,560
like, it's only half full

721
00:29:41,969 --> 00:29:44,020
for whatever reason, half my stuff is missing.

722
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:48,689
-- I'm like, so
-- I, I just did this with uh iphoto because

723
00:29:49,469 --> 00:29:51,969
I needed to give someone a bunch of pictures

724
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,040
and

725
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,290
I used Windows.

726
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:58,170
You can install the icloud app, you can tell it to sync the data,

727
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,390
but it doesn't really sync at all.

728
00:29:59,400 --> 00:29:59,930
It's weird

729
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,500
what I kept doing is I would go and open the directory.

730
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:05,650
Now, mind you, I have like 40 gigs of photos and videos and stuff. So

731
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:11,410
I would open the directory control a like select all drag it somewhere else.

732
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,650
It would run for like literally hours.

733
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,689
Then I did, I kept doing that over and over and over again until it ran.

734
00:30:17,699 --> 00:30:20,209
It didn't find new stuff to copy and it took like

735
00:30:20,339 --> 00:30:22,140
-- days
-- and I'm looking at basically writing a

736
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,000
Python or something script to walk the directory,

737
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:26,959
touch each file or whatever, you know, basically force Windows to,

738
00:30:26,969 --> 00:30:28,160
to do something with it.

739
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:31,560
-- I wonder if that would work. I don't know. Anyway, I got it done so
-- well.

740
00:30:31,569 --> 00:30:35,680
Basically you need to get windows to actually, like, see that

741
00:30:35,949 --> 00:30:37,900
I need to copy the file locally versus, like,

742
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:41,239
I need to pretend that I have a copy of the file locally until you don't click on it

743
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:45,500
and it does that anyway. All right, whatever. We're in the weeds.

744
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,040
But, and this is a perfect example of like, that is not

745
00:30:48,459 --> 00:30:51,160
like normal, people are gonna be like, what the hell are they talking about?

746
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,260
That's true. That's true.

747
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,630
I think this is, I mean, and, and you raise a good point,

748
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,540
like not everyone has computers to, to do like backups of this kind of stuff.

749
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,900
And that, that's a hard problem.

750
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:03,589
And your least worst answer here is spend the 2 to

751
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:06,040
$3 a month to get the 100 gigs of storage.

752
00:31:06,069 --> 00:31:09,739
Except if Google decides they don't like you one day, like you're hosed.

753
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,459
-- This
-- doesn't create a new problem. That's always a problem.

754
00:31:12,469 --> 00:31:13,140
That's fair.

755
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:16,660
That's fair. All right. Anyway, anyway, let's, let's call this one.

756
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:18,660
It's Christmas. It's Boxing Day.

757
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:19,479
Kurt.

758
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,939
Merry Christmas.

759
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:23,810
-- You too.
-- Merry Christmas. To everyone listening.

760
00:31:23,959 --> 00:31:26,540
-- Oh, yeah.
-- Merry Christmas to everyone. To all a good night.

761
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,439
Yeah. And I hope your relatives didn't torture you too much with tech problems.

762
00:31:30,449 --> 00:31:30,930
All right.

763
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,739
Thanks everyone. Bye bye.

764
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:38,459
That.
