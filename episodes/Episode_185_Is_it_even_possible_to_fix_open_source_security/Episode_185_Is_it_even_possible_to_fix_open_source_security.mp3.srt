Hello and welcome to the Open source Security podcast episode 185 with myself, Kurt

1
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,649
Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,920
-- So,
-- what's new?

3
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,659
I think spring is almost here.

4
00:00:15,819 --> 00:00:19,110
-- I hope so, man. I need it. Yeah.
-- No, it's, uh,

5
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,030
yeah,

6
00:00:20,709 --> 00:00:24,540
exactly. So funny enough. I was watching the news this morning.

7
00:00:24,549 --> 00:00:27,860
One of the things I do in my mornings is I turn on the news,

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,809
I read the newspaper and I drink coffee and the people

9
00:00:30,819 --> 00:00:35,270
on the news said that we have received 20 inches more

10
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,479
of snow than is average at this point already in the year.

11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,869
And that's not enjoyable. Right.

12
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:47,139
It's a lot of shoveling. It is a lot of shoveling and I'm, I'm done with snow now.

13
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,790
So if it never snows again, I'm cool with that.

14
00:00:49,869 --> 00:00:53,139
-- Well,
-- except for them, the widespread crop failures would be a problem.

15
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,240
I feel it seems like a small price to

16
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,310
-- pay for my personal convenience
-- for not shoveling.

17
00:00:58,319 --> 00:01:00,250
I, I'm not going to disagree with you

18
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,950
anyway.

19
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,389
So we are going to discuss the Linux Foundation today.

20
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,349
There's a news story that just came out

21
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:12,419
when, at the time of recording.

22
00:01:12,589 --> 00:01:17,050
But why don't you explain it to the listeners and we'll go from there.

23
00:01:17,059 --> 00:01:20,949
So, the Linux Foundation has done something that I think is actually quite useful.

24
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:27,339
It's called the Census. And so the basic premise is they look at the open source

25
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:30,819
ecosystem and look at sort of

26
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,540
what software really matters, right?

27
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,800
And some of it's, you know, we know it's obvious like open SSL, basically,

28
00:01:36,809 --> 00:01:38,169
if something does crypto

29
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:42,180
in the open source world, it's what 98 let's say, percent chance.

30
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,720
-- It's probably using open SSL
-- without question.

31
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:45,330
Yes,

32
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,699
-- but
-- they're looking at things that are maybe a little

33
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:51,660
less obvious but widely used or widely relied upon.

34
00:01:51,669 --> 00:01:53,819
You know, my favorite example being what was that thing?

35
00:01:54,029 --> 00:01:57,519
It was called like Left shift. And the guy, what did he do?

36
00:01:57,529 --> 00:02:01,500
He like took it off of no Js or whatever. And it broke like every website on the planet,

37
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:05,610
right? And all it did was like justify text to the left or something.

38
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,279
-- It
-- removed spaces,

39
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,399
I think before text and the actually

40
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,639
the metadata in that package was magnitudes larger

41
00:02:14,649 --> 00:02:17,570
than the actual code because it was like three or four lines of code.

42
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,199
-- Yeah,
-- I remember it was like four lines of code.

43
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,169
And I was kind of wondering like, as much as I, I, you know, we,

44
00:02:22,179 --> 00:02:24,509
we a lot of people say the classic, you know, you should use a library,

45
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,080
not cut and paste code, but in this case,

46
00:02:26,089 --> 00:02:28,309
you probably should cut and paste the code because,

47
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,619
you know, it's like

48
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,050
string stripping.

49
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,619
That's not the node way though. No

50
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:41,460
N PM is all about having millions of dependencies that all do one obscure thing.

51
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:43,850
And I've even seen ones that are like a configuration thing,

52
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,330
like they set up their configuration as libraries because,

53
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,949
well, that's kind of the only way they know how to pull stuff in. But anyway,

54
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,910
so the census two report, I forget when they did the first one.

55
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,229
But I'm, oh, here it says, uh in 2015.

56
00:02:57,289 --> 00:02:59,649
So it's been a while. Well, every five years, isn't that?

57
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,529
-- How often the US does a census,
-- 10 years, every 10 years we're due this year,

58
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:04,139
actually.

59
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:05,080
Oh, interesting.

60
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:07,339
Yeah, I mean, they basically look at this and

61
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:12,050
there's a lot of software that isn't widely known but is widely used.

62
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,160
There's also a lot of software that

63
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:17,570
probably has more vulnerabilities than it should for how much it's used

64
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,800
and relied upon.

65
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,350
That's fair. I mean, what's amusing to me is that

66
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,740
we're still sort of trotting up this line that, you know,

67
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,759
somehow open sources is still growing.

68
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:31,899
It's not folks, it's, it's one like it's what,

69
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,470
80% of the world's software or something.

70
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:34,779
Now

71
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,460
that's actually in use or something.

72
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:37,699
In the, in the

73
00:03:37,899 --> 00:03:39,699
article we will link in the show notes.

74
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:43,139
Apparently Red Hat did a study and it's somewhere between 80

75
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:47,529
90%. And I believe that 100% because I know in, in the

76
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,960
elastic universe we've done a bunch of analysis of our source code

77
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:58,000
and it is about 80% dependencies and 20% stuff we wrote.

78
00:03:58,009 --> 00:03:59,460
-- And
-- I kind of wonder how much of that skews

79
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,119
because a lot of these dependencies are huge in that.

80
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,580
This isn't like a small package that does one tiny little specific thing.

81
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:10,199
It started out that way, but then it started doing other things. And you know, they,

82
00:04:10,529 --> 00:04:13,440
the thing I always love about pulling these libraries is a bunch of

83
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:16,200
other people spent five years chasing down all the corner cases for me.

84
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:20,790
Right. Well, and there's an unusual aspect of this and I'm actually still,

85
00:04:21,074 --> 00:04:24,324
I'm writing a bunch of blog posts to try to help explain what's going on here.

86
00:04:24,334 --> 00:04:26,454
When you use a dependency, a

87
00:04:26,593 --> 00:04:27,813
library you pull in.

88
00:04:27,824 --> 00:04:29,553
Like you said, there's all these corner cases,

89
00:04:29,563 --> 00:04:31,963
there's often a lot of features that it uses.

90
00:04:31,973 --> 00:04:35,683
It's not just one little thing in many cases. And this is actually where I think no,

91
00:04:35,813 --> 00:04:38,123
like it actually handles more than one currency,

92
00:04:38,364 --> 00:04:39,753
right? For example, and

93
00:04:39,973 --> 00:04:43,273
most people are only using one small portion of it.

94
00:04:43,294 --> 00:04:48,283
And so, well, yes, let's say it pulls in 10,000 lines of code. I might only be using

95
00:04:48,523 --> 00:04:48,533
a

96
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:50,567
and lines of that code in my project.

97
00:04:50,578 --> 00:04:52,928
But then it also creates issues because now I

98
00:04:52,937 --> 00:04:56,127
have 10,000 lines of code I'm technically not using

99
00:04:56,178 --> 00:04:58,627
and some of it will have security issues and

100
00:04:58,638 --> 00:05:01,988
like the problem is crazy and very difficult.

101
00:05:01,997 --> 00:05:05,597
Well, and then there's even like the lower level bits where they pull in XML or G

102
00:05:05,697 --> 00:05:08,778
zip so that it'll compile natively on windows.

103
00:05:08,898 --> 00:05:11,278
You know, I remember with the XML hash

104
00:05:11,388 --> 00:05:13,717
do stuff way back in the day when I started at

105
00:05:13,727 --> 00:05:15,578
Red Hat and looking at all this stuff and I'm like,

106
00:05:15,588 --> 00:05:16,157
why is this stuff

107
00:05:16,272 --> 00:05:18,131
pulling in G zip and you know XML,

108
00:05:18,141 --> 00:05:21,772
it's like we provide libraries for that and then I start reading all these, you know,

109
00:05:21,782 --> 00:05:23,092
packages and it's like, oh so,

110
00:05:23,302 --> 00:05:25,631
so it'll compile on windows cleanly because on windows you

111
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:28,492
don't have like G zip dot So or whatever.

112
00:05:28,522 --> 00:05:31,432
And even in, I mean, depending upon your environment now,

113
00:05:31,441 --> 00:05:33,812
like with the universe of containers where it's

114
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:36,212
all about let's run the smallest possible container.

115
00:05:36,221 --> 00:05:38,361
It's becoming common practice again to just kind

116
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:40,451
of pull in all these binary objects.

117
00:05:40,462 --> 00:05:43,691
-- And that's how you deploy your software now.
-- Well,

118
00:05:43,955 --> 00:05:47,415
the reality is a statically compiled binary with, you know,

119
00:05:47,425 --> 00:05:51,605
containers being like the extreme example of that work, you turn them on, they run,

120
00:05:51,615 --> 00:05:52,036
right.

121
00:05:52,045 --> 00:05:57,446
And you rarely have problems where the version of the library you have on the system.

122
00:05:57,455 --> 00:05:59,835
Windows 95 DLL hell, I mean,

123
00:06:00,365 --> 00:06:02,735
-- right. You and I have both been through that
-- even on Linux

124
00:06:02,865 --> 00:06:03,966
man, I mean,

125
00:06:04,186 --> 00:06:05,385
I remember

126
00:06:05,506 --> 00:06:08,045
this, I mean, this is a million years ago, but

127
00:06:08,205 --> 00:06:11,536
I worked at an ISP and we bought like a binary

128
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,910
application that was designed to run on Red Hat.

129
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,010
It was Red Hat Linux back then, probably version four or five.

130
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:21,200
It was long, long ago and we installed it and nothing worked

131
00:06:21,309 --> 00:06:24,739
because it was expecting certain libraries in certain places.

132
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,350
And I remember we ended up just like,

133
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:30,359
manually putting things in weird places just to make this stupid thing work.

134
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:34,500
-- And it was, that was terrible. I mean, it was so obnoxious. It
-- wasn't Se Linux

135
00:06:34,619 --> 00:06:36,989
that I used, but I used something, I think it was like, I notify or something.

136
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,220
I basically, I would like, run the program

137
00:06:39,324 --> 00:06:43,924
and like, see what binary or library was looking for and what location and then like,

138
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:44,854
yeah, copy it there,

139
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:46,954
simlink it there and then run the program again and

140
00:06:46,963 --> 00:06:48,794
it would get like one step further and fail.

141
00:06:49,053 --> 00:06:49,664
-- Uh
-- There's,

142
00:06:50,153 --> 00:06:51,944
you know, there's something called LDD,

143
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:55,484
which is the linker and if you run the linker against a binary,

144
00:06:55,493 --> 00:06:58,104
it will tell you what libraries it's looking for.

145
00:06:58,114 --> 00:06:59,303
That'll let you cheat. True.

146
00:06:59,313 --> 00:07:02,614
But some of these, I remember having software that was so broken and brittle that,

147
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:05,334
you know, it needed the libraries in a specific location or,

148
00:07:05,743 --> 00:07:06,873
or be ever infamous

149
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,347
one where it needed something totally different from the system.

150
00:07:09,437 --> 00:07:12,298
-- That yeah, that happens all the time. It was terrible.
-- Do I see a truth?

151
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:15,868
This thing, you know, run it in a jail, like, or do I just like,

152
00:07:16,007 --> 00:07:16,808
right? S

153
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:20,667
-- link and just document it and pray it never breaks.
-- Yep. Yep.

154
00:07:20,678 --> 00:07:22,398
No, I remember those days.

155
00:07:22,407 --> 00:07:26,787
So, so anyway, anyway, we're talking about the Linux Foundation and their,

156
00:07:26,798 --> 00:07:27,537
their census,

157
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:30,708
they did and all these applications and I feel like

158
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:34,588
I'm going to take a somewhat controversial stance here and

159
00:07:34,691 --> 00:07:35,941
we get to argue which is fun.

160
00:07:36,131 --> 00:07:36,671
But

161
00:07:36,772 --> 00:07:39,372
so the Linux Foundation did this work

162
00:07:39,511 --> 00:07:43,432
and they identified these problems and I think that's wonderful,

163
00:07:43,441 --> 00:07:47,962
but then they start talking about what they're doing to make it better.

164
00:07:48,171 --> 00:07:53,152
And I feel like the Linux Foundation should be doing more.

165
00:07:53,252 --> 00:07:56,231
I think they are in a position to

166
00:07:56,332 --> 00:07:58,011
accomplish great things.

167
00:07:58,022 --> 00:08:00,582
And I feel like they have squandered what they have

168
00:08:00,592 --> 00:08:04,156
attempted and I'm sure not a super popular view.

169
00:08:04,165 --> 00:08:07,756
Every time I look at what they, what I feel like they could or should be doing.

170
00:08:07,765 --> 00:08:11,286
I feel like they are not living up to my expectations.

171
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,615
Well, I'm not going to 100% disagree with you.

172
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:17,295
But at the same time having kind of lived through similar efforts like the DWF, it's,

173
00:08:17,305 --> 00:08:18,846
it's more complicated than that.

174
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:22,675
I, I won't disagree with you and it is hard

175
00:08:22,776 --> 00:08:26,355
and I think there's a other side of the coin even

176
00:08:26,485 --> 00:08:29,915
where there's the angle of what, what they could or should do.

177
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,539
And then there's the angle of this is the world we have,

178
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:37,760
how do we make it better or rather how do we exist in it versus saying, oh, we should,

179
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,840
you know, the, this software is owned by a dude in his basement.

180
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,239
-- So how do we, how do we fix that? It's
-- like the Coronavirus thing.

181
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:48,039
Just have everybody self isolate for 14 days and the plague will burn itself out.

182
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,070
That's totally reasonable. Yes,

183
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,520
that's my dream, my dream, Kurt,

184
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:56,520
I'll isolate myself forever and then I'll never get sick.

185
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,580
It's wonderful. But

186
00:08:58,989 --> 00:08:59,739
no, I say that, I,

187
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,080
I bet after 14 days I would be climbing the

188
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,630
walls like I would talk to anybody at that point.

189
00:09:05,669 --> 00:09:07,140
But anyway, anyway,

190
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:10,380
so kind of, here's, here's the example I want to give.

191
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:14,260
So I'll, we'll pick on Low Dash because we picked on them a couple of episodes ago.

192
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:20,679
-- So Lo Dash is a project that's literally owned by a person.
-- I think they didn't, it

193
00:09:20,989 --> 00:09:22,099
-- finally open
-- up?

194
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,210
Uh Not, not that I know of. That was not Lo Dash. That was the, what

195
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:26,450
a

196
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,159
web

197
00:09:27,549 --> 00:09:28,179
that was.

198
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:28,830
Yeah.

199
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:30,669
They hit rock bottom.

200
00:09:30,929 --> 00:09:30,979
Like,

201
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:34,719
-- isn't there yet? I believe
-- they had an intervention and it's working itself.

202
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,890
So it's a person

203
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,359
and they own it

204
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:42,570
and they're obviously busy and this isn't their job or anything like that.

205
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:45,450
And so we have the universe of saying

206
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,489
and, and we did this where we're like, oh,

207
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:50,359
you should open this up to the community. You should accept help.

208
00:09:50,369 --> 00:09:53,450
There's all these things you can do and there's nothing wrong with saying that.

209
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,250
And I feel like that's what the Linux foundation is doing also.

210
00:09:56,669 --> 00:09:58,390
But at the same time,

211
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:02,719
how do we look at this and say, OK, so I have a piece of code

212
00:10:02,859 --> 00:10:06,109
that's literally maintained by a guy in his basement.

213
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:10,159
How do we make sure that it's secure and it's something I can

214
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:15,280
run safely because I understand that this is the world we live in.

215
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,809
-- So be it
-- one step, for example,

216
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,679
would be committing some resources to it and say

217
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,400
submitting some patches that improve it or fix bugs.

218
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:27,090
People have done that and the author isn't accepting them.

219
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:29,460
And then that's kind of where we go to step two, right?

220
00:10:29,469 --> 00:10:32,849
So if the author does accept your patches and things move on, then it's, you know,

221
00:10:32,859 --> 00:10:34,200
reasonably healthy, right?

222
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:38,320
But if it's, if the author is not accepting your patches or not talking,

223
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,419
then, well, by definition, that's not super healthy.

224
00:10:41,429 --> 00:10:44,789
And, you know, maybe they're busy, maybe they're sick, maybe they have a real job,

225
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:45,580
maybe, you know,

226
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:48,479
I remember one case the person went on was on vacation

227
00:10:48,489 --> 00:10:51,559
for like months like they were off in Asia or something.

228
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:55,210
-- You know, when one of those big kerfuffles hit it
-- can happen. And

229
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
that's an instance where

230
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,400
nothing

231
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,994
is a different message than a no,

232
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:06,875
I won't take your patch because I don't want to or I won't take it now because I'm busy,

233
00:11:06,885 --> 00:11:08,825
I'll look at it again later someday

234
00:11:08,945 --> 00:11:13,075
and, and part of my thinking would be so if you try to submit good patches

235
00:11:13,445 --> 00:11:16,234
and that's the thing too. A lot of people think they're submitting good patches and,

236
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:16,625
well,

237
00:11:16,924 --> 00:11:17,255
you know,

238
00:11:17,655 --> 00:11:19,375
there's a lot of emails from Lynes Torvalds

239
00:11:19,594 --> 00:11:20,585
on this topic that's

240
00:11:20,765 --> 00:11:22,155
hilariously bad.

241
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:24,500
Well, but he's not always wrong.

242
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,119
Sometimes he's wrong, but usually he's not completely wrong.

243
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,929
He could be a bit nicer about it though. So in that case, no offense.

244
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,309
But one of the real significant freedoms of open source is you can fork

245
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,049
it and go take your ball and play in your own yard with it.

246
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:41,664
Yeah, but we, we talked about this a couple of episodes ago like forking.

247
00:11:41,674 --> 00:11:42,914
Well, but I mean, if it's,

248
00:11:42,924 --> 00:11:45,405
if it's that critical for you and you really need

249
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:47,385
it to work and you really need these patches then,

250
00:11:47,395 --> 00:11:48,294
well, suck it up.

251
00:11:48,304 --> 00:11:52,344
-- Buttercup.
-- I mean, no, no, it doesn't work like that anymore

252
00:11:52,554 --> 00:11:55,864
because if you're using, say N PM

253
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,385
as part of your node project,

254
00:11:58,739 --> 00:12:00,760
you're going to be pulling in dependencies and those

255
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,159
dependencies are going to pull in other things.

256
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:06,049
-- That's an unrealistic expectation
-- card.

257
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,599
It is, I think an unrealistic expectation.

258
00:12:08,609 --> 00:12:11,640
But then it also speaks to what these people expect from

259
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:14,159
the ecosystem to get sort of for free as it were.

260
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:17,960
This is exactly where, where I think we wanted to go with this is.

261
00:12:17,969 --> 00:12:18,380
So,

262
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:21,059
you have the Linux Foundation talking about the way the world should

263
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,219
work and they've dedicated resources into

264
00:12:23,229 --> 00:12:25,299
various projects and in all seriousness,

265
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:27,820
I don't think they've been runaway successes.

266
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,440
-- I think you could argue.
-- They're trying to boil the ocean. Yes. Right.

267
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,830
Like, like it's like trying to get CV, coverage for all of the world's software.

268
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,619
-- Right. The answer is it's not going to happen.
-- Exactly. You're exactly right.

269
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,979
The Linux Foundation cast their net wide

270
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:44,690
-- and they've missed everything.
-- Well, part of the problem too is there's

271
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,409
like this, how do I put this nicely?

272
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:48,809
The software industry is so fundamentally broken

273
00:12:48,979 --> 00:12:49,809
that quote unquote.

274
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,890
The first lesson learned from this report is the

275
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,830
need for a standardized naming scheme for software components.

276
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,049
And that's never happening.

277
00:12:56,429 --> 00:12:56,940
You know,

278
00:12:57,429 --> 00:13:00,799
number two, the increasing importance of individual developer account security,

279
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:01,070
right?

280
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,630
Yeah, easy. We'll just get all the developers to, you know, go turn on two fa

281
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:05,890
github

282
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:06,539
super

283
00:13:07,739 --> 00:13:07,770
easy.

284
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,330
And then, oh, and this is my favorite,

285
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,599
the persistence of legacy software in the open source space.

286
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:17,390
I've worked for Red Hat. So, you know, I'm kind of guilty of this one.

287
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:22,989
-- I I was part of the problem here.
-- These problems are never going to go away.

288
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,640
These are problems like saying, oh, the problem with crime is people steal stuff.

289
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:31,039
So, you know, if, if everybody just stopped stealing stuff or

290
00:13:31,469 --> 00:13:36,380
you know, nobody ever lost a house key or left their left the door unlocked or uh well,

291
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:39,059
yeah, perfect example, if nobody ever left a door or a window unlock

292
00:13:39,372 --> 00:13:39,903
open,

293
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:40,353
you know,

294
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:42,713
there'd be a bit less crime because like there are literally people

295
00:13:42,723 --> 00:13:45,023
go around jiggling door handles and then if the door is open,

296
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,763
they, you know, clear out your glove box or whatever.

297
00:13:47,802 --> 00:13:50,223
Sure. Uh Yeah, that would help reduce crime of it.

298
00:13:50,232 --> 00:13:54,713
But, well, like the Coronavirus, if everybody would just for the love of Pete,

299
00:13:54,723 --> 00:13:57,713
just wash your hands once in a while with soap.

300
00:13:57,953 --> 00:14:02,543
No, like seriously, dude, how often have you been in a bathroom with other adults?

301
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,776
And one of them uses the toilet or in case the

302
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:06,166
journal

303
00:14:06,356 --> 00:14:09,335
-- and then walks out of the room,
-- we discussed this

304
00:14:09,565 --> 00:14:11,995
a couple of I think last it was two episodes ago.

305
00:14:12,005 --> 00:14:13,596
Whenever we talk about the Coronavirus,

306
00:14:13,606 --> 00:14:17,536
we can't get people to wash their hands reliably.

307
00:14:17,546 --> 00:14:20,976
I know, man, you're proving all of my points for me, I think.

308
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:21,286
Well,

309
00:14:21,296 --> 00:14:23,556
I guess the point then is maybe the lungs foundation

310
00:14:23,565 --> 00:14:26,856
isn't doing so bad given these insane constraints of reality,

311
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,796
they're collecting and spending a lot of money.

312
00:14:29,806 --> 00:14:31,536
So if that's a goal, they're doing great.

313
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:32,455
But,

314
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:32,780
but

315
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:34,010
the point is

316
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,520
there's all these realities and

317
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,030
you're never going to change many of them. And so we have to exist in that universe.

318
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,119
Like I'll give you a great example of at restaurants.

319
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,000
There is a 100% chance that some of the staff

320
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,140
don't wash their hands when they use the toilet.

321
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,679
Otherwise there wouldn't be signs

322
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,739
that's true.

323
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,219
But there are other controls in place where you

324
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:58,549
expect them to wear gloves and wear other material.

325
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,669
And there's expectations around handling of certain things, right?

326
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:06,750
Like this is all related where the people who are creating these rules around food,

327
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:11,359
health and safety know that part of the story means there are people using

328
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:15,830
the toilet and not washing their hands even though there's a sign that says

329
00:15:15,932 --> 00:15:19,033
-- they must do it.
-- Yeah. And so this is lovely.

330
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,232
The CDC in America estimates one in six

331
00:15:21,242 --> 00:15:23,793
Americans are affected by foodborne illnesses annually.

332
00:15:23,802 --> 00:15:26,833
I have no doubt. I'm shocked it's that low.

333
00:15:27,153 --> 00:15:31,353
-- I would expect it to be much, much higher.
-- One in six is a lot.

334
00:15:31,362 --> 00:15:33,312
Yeah, it is a lot.

335
00:15:33,322 --> 00:15:37,153
That's like more than, that's more people, that's more than people that get the flu.

336
00:15:37,163 --> 00:15:40,072
I believe that though because people go out

337
00:15:40,176 --> 00:15:41,286
to eat a lot.

338
00:15:41,296 --> 00:15:43,395
Well, this also counts as like food that, you know, like the,

339
00:15:43,406 --> 00:15:46,416
remember when all the spinach was contaminated by wild pig poop?

340
00:15:46,426 --> 00:15:47,875
Yes. Yes, I do.

341
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:53,116
So, actually my wife caught a parasite eating lettuce one time.

342
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:56,216
-- It was some, like, you've got to cook
-- your lettuce, man. You've got to boil that.

343
00:15:56,505 --> 00:15:57,695
Exactly.

344
00:15:58,005 --> 00:15:59,596
And it was funny because she got like all these

345
00:15:59,606 --> 00:16:01,776
phone calls from the county Health Department and they're like,

346
00:16:01,786 --> 00:16:02,156
no.

347
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,276
And she was in Indiana

348
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:06,960
and caught it and then came back to Wisconsin and, yeah,

349
00:16:06,969 --> 00:16:08,349
like everyone was freaking out.

350
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:10,849
It was beautiful. It was some little, uh,

351
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,599
one of the single cell parasite

352
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:13,239
Deos.

353
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,049
And then, yeah, like you take some medicine, you're fine after a couple of days.

354
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:19,369
-- Well, let's assume
-- you identify what it is and have the medicine available. Uh.

355
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:19,739
Right.

356
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,525
-- And it did take a week to figure it out
-- and that's

357
00:16:22,534 --> 00:16:24,585
something we sort of take for granted in the western world.

358
00:16:24,594 --> 00:16:25,575
We can go to a doctor,

359
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:28,465
see a doctor relatively quickly and then get medicine from the pharmacy.

360
00:16:28,815 --> 00:16:32,385
-- Right. Usually all in a period of less than half a day.
-- That's right. Actually.

361
00:16:32,395 --> 00:16:33,815
So, it's funny you say that to us.

362
00:16:33,825 --> 00:16:34,424
So, my,

363
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:39,125
my daughter has what they call Colonial Day at school today when we're recording

364
00:16:39,315 --> 00:16:42,465
and they, like, go dress up, they pretend they're old timey and they,

365
00:16:42,474 --> 00:16:44,065
they do all this old timey stuff.

366
00:16:44,094 --> 00:16:45,744
Are they allowed to use bandaids if they get hurt?

367
00:16:45,914 --> 00:16:47,705
I, I probably,

368
00:16:48,114 --> 00:16:49,145
but they,

369
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,650
she was talking about how, oh, everyone was probably sick all the time.

370
00:16:52,659 --> 00:16:55,340
And I just, I remember I was, I was working on my computer.

371
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:57,320
I looked up, I said everyone had worms,

372
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,820
all of them had worms all the time and they had lice and she's like,

373
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,979
-- like,
-- well, yeah, what was it, the whole thing in the Southern Us with,

374
00:17:04,989 --> 00:17:07,380
with toilets and privy and ringworm, you know,

375
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,098
because people were walking around in bare feet all the time.

376
00:17:10,108 --> 00:17:13,459
-- No one
-- wore shoes. Exactly. Everyone had no hookworms.

377
00:17:13,469 --> 00:17:14,810
Hookworms are what you get in the toilet.

378
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,229
Yes.

379
00:17:15,608 --> 00:17:17,880
Yeah. Things we take for granted in the morning.

380
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:21,961
Seriously. Like no one has worms anymore. It's one. Well, we don't. But

381
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,661
anyway, why are we talking about worms? We're talking

382
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:25,921
about software.

383
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,349
Well, I, I think the,

384
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:33,551
it's kind of a very close analogy to sort of the current health state of the open

385
00:17:33,691 --> 00:17:34,171
source ecosystem.

386
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,600
You know, actually, you're right. I, I agree.

387
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,480
-- It's
-- this low level of parasite that's not going to kill you.

388
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:42,130
But, you know, is there an ex ss in your web framework?

389
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,370
Yes. Yes, there is. And what was that Cryptocurrency place

390
00:17:46,484 --> 00:17:49,104
-- that just had to shut down because of an ex ss?
-- Right?

391
00:17:49,114 --> 00:17:51,004
-- I don't remember the name but I know what you mean.
-- Yeah.

392
00:17:51,014 --> 00:17:54,323
So, you know, sometimes these little parasites are well,

393
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,583
if you're not healthy then, then they're really, really bad.

394
00:17:56,593 --> 00:18:01,624
And so I guess let's stay on this topic for a minute because if you think about it,

395
00:18:01,634 --> 00:18:03,413
from the health perspective, you have,

396
00:18:03,423 --> 00:18:05,534
there are certain things you can do for prevention.

397
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:09,583
But even if you do everything you could possibly do for prevention, like,

398
00:18:09,593 --> 00:18:11,573
let's say you wash your hands and you make sure your

399
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,874
food is clean and you're getting it from a good source,

400
00:18:14,965 --> 00:18:16,755
whatever you can still get sick

401
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:20,105
there is, there's nothing that says you won't, you will get sick.

402
00:18:20,635 --> 00:18:22,595
You will. But you might not get worms. Right.

403
00:18:22,605 --> 00:18:24,645
Like, to my knowledge, I've never had worms.

404
00:18:24,796 --> 00:18:28,265
-- I'm sure part of that is because I take certain precautions.
-- Right.

405
00:18:28,276 --> 00:18:30,546
Well, but we also live in the western world where we've got, you know,

406
00:18:30,556 --> 00:18:32,485
massive controls at scale.

407
00:18:32,755 --> 00:18:33,095
So that,

408
00:18:33,635 --> 00:18:36,985
you know, we don't have to worry about things like cholera because the, you know,

409
00:18:36,995 --> 00:18:40,255
the vast majority of North Americans use toilets.

410
00:18:40,265 --> 00:18:43,306
They don't go in the street, thank goodness anymore.

411
00:18:43,869 --> 00:18:45,569
So, I think like a lot of things, you know,

412
00:18:45,579 --> 00:18:49,890
when 99% of people do a reasonably sane behavior,

413
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,290
like washing their hands after they go to the bathroom and before they handle food,

414
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,260
then you can sort of start to nip this

415
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,880
stuff in the bud and prevent widespread outbreaks.

416
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,079
You'll, you'll still have outbreaks but they're very localized.

417
00:19:00,089 --> 00:19:01,869
They, they sort of, they don't transmit,

418
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,109
they don't kind of break out of the one

419
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:05,329
restaurant that had one person doing one bad thing.

420
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,000
Right. Right. Right. But now let's compare it to software.

421
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,239
And I feel like we're at the point where people are

422
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,939
dumping the chamber pots out the window into the street right now

423
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,599
and there's little, there's not a lot of good hygiene.

424
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:21,349
No. Well, and it's hard though, like, even something.

425
00:19:21,719 --> 00:19:24,069
And I say a simple with giant air quotes here,

426
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,089
continuous integration and continuous delivery,

427
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:30,300
like having a good testing framework or not even having a good testing framework.

428
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:30,839
But having a

429
00:19:30,949 --> 00:19:32,510
framework for testing,

430
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:35,670
you can actually write test, right? Remember when we had the guy on the show

431
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:37,719
and they're talking about, that's one of the big problems,

432
00:19:37,729 --> 00:19:40,329
a lot of these projects have, they, they don't even have a testing framework,

433
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:41,380
let alone test.

434
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:45,010
And even having like a blank testing framework would be

435
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:48,020
a massive step forward because now you have the possibility of

436
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,619
writing tests and

437
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,589
actually running them once in a while.

438
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:54,780
And yeah, the majority of software, well, I mean,

439
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,500
whenever you see a really simplistic regression, well,

440
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,790
obviously there's something a bit deeper missing

441
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,390
there because that should not have happened.

442
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,810
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah. Yeah. No, I

443
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,449
I agree. I agree completely.

444
00:20:04,459 --> 00:20:07,770
And it's, it's part of, it's part of the larger story,

445
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:11,520
right is where you have this way to test and to understand

446
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:13,449
what's happening in your environment.

447
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:15,209
But even with that, right,

448
00:20:15,219 --> 00:20:18,800
there's still going to be instances where things get missed, bad things get in,

449
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:19,050
right?

450
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,849
-- It's again like going back to health
-- also new things.

451
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:24,770
Remember when you know, buffer overflows were Black magic.

452
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,329
I mean, remember when return oriented programming first came along and it was like,

453
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:29,449
who

454
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:31,170
is this?

455
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,449
-- And now it's just a thing, it's a Wikipedia page like whatever
-- again,

456
00:20:34,459 --> 00:20:36,209
like if we compare this to public health,

457
00:20:36,219 --> 00:20:39,609
there are new diseases happening all the time,

458
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,770
right? Like Coronavirus is a brand new disease that we've never seen before.

459
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,290
And now we have to figure out what to do with it. And this is

460
00:20:46,489 --> 00:20:48,250
this exactly parallels

461
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:52,579
world of security where new techniques are found, new problems are found.

462
00:20:52,589 --> 00:20:54,349
And now you have to figure out what to do with it.

463
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:58,890
And I feel like we still have that attitude of we can fix this instead of saying,

464
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,849
all right, we got a new problem.

465
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:05,569
How do we like, stop everyone from dying and like 10% of people dying is,

466
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:07,020
is the best we're going to get.

467
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:07,579
Well,

468
00:21:07,689 --> 00:21:11,020
I mean, the one real thing I see in the infosec industry is that whole,

469
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:12,859
the perfect be the enemy of the good, you know,

470
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:14,939
so many infosec people want it perfect.

471
00:21:14,949 --> 00:21:16,890
And it's like, well, number one ain't gonna happen.

472
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,449
I got bad news for you but it's just like like fishing and what is,

473
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:22,449
what do they call S MS fishing attack?

474
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:26,839
I think they call it smashing and fishing and spear fishing and all that stuff.

475
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:31,709
That degree of social engineering will never go away because it will always work.

476
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,530
Exactly.

477
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:38,869
And so part of it is not solving it, but it's, you know,

478
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:39,150
a

479
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,579
great example is this, I noticed in gmail now

480
00:21:42,699 --> 00:21:46,079
I use the Marcus spam button maybe once or twice a week.

481
00:21:46,089 --> 00:21:49,839
-- Remember what it was like 10 or 20 years ago?
-- It, it used to be bad, in fact.

482
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:52,599
So I, I look, I was digging through my spam folder,

483
00:21:52,609 --> 00:21:55,319
the other day because I was expecting a message and I didn't see it.

484
00:21:55,329 --> 00:21:57,910
And so I was like, maybe it's in spam and it actually was,

485
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,359
but I was looking in there in my spam folder is almost all sales.

486
00:22:01,662 --> 00:22:03,083
Now, I'm like, this is awesome.

487
00:22:03,353 --> 00:22:04,723
This is the dream.

488
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:09,613
The spam email I do get is actually typically directly emailed to me. And it's

489
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:11,802
like, it's I didn't ask for it.

490
00:22:11,812 --> 00:22:16,042
So it's spam but it's not like spam spam, you know, it's actually somewhat targeted.

491
00:22:16,713 --> 00:22:20,642
And yeah. Yeah, whenever I do look through my, my folder, it's just like, oh,

492
00:22:20,762 --> 00:22:23,343
you know. Yeah. No, that, that is clearly not stuff I want,

493
00:22:23,613 --> 00:22:25,542
you know, what else amazes me is.

494
00:22:25,772 --> 00:22:28,633
Some of these companies are emailing me like three and four

495
00:22:28,745 --> 00:22:32,426
times a day and I think, do they know they're going in the spam folder?

496
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:34,995
-- And they're hoping one of the mail sneaks out
-- well,

497
00:22:35,005 --> 00:22:37,265
but it's cheaper to do that than to clean their email list,

498
00:22:37,395 --> 00:22:38,666
-- I guess.
-- Yeah,

499
00:22:38,776 --> 00:22:42,706
it's, but it's not the same mail. They're like all different. It's, it's terrible.

500
00:22:42,715 --> 00:22:45,735
Well, my favorite is too is like, I'll look for the unsubscribe link now, you know,

501
00:22:45,745 --> 00:22:48,816
hit control f unsubscribe and a lot of emails still don't have it.

502
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:51,255
They'll have like reply with removed or whatever.

503
00:22:51,265 --> 00:22:54,725
And I'm like, oh, those I mar a spam and hope to never see again.

504
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:55,015
Right.

505
00:22:55,036 --> 00:22:58,818
But back to the public health kind of thing is I think part of the problem is, is that

506
00:22:58,979 --> 00:23:01,808
with these online epidemics of, you know,

507
00:23:01,818 --> 00:23:05,168
some virus or Trojan or some attack goes through.

508
00:23:05,188 --> 00:23:08,168
I don't want to say we have good visibility into how bad it is, but it's kind of,

509
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:11,848
it does tend to be, especially if it's like a major site.

510
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:13,038
We do tend to be,

511
00:23:13,218 --> 00:23:14,729
we, we think it's really bad,

512
00:23:14,739 --> 00:23:17,479
usually a lot worse than it is a great example being like that

513
00:23:17,489 --> 00:23:20,568
iot attack that bled over and they had to shut down a major,

514
00:23:20,578 --> 00:23:22,609
I think it was a natural gas pipeline or something.

515
00:23:23,312 --> 00:23:26,692
So, you know, information security people always kind of want perfect like,

516
00:23:26,702 --> 00:23:27,771
you know, like spam filtering.

517
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,692
Oh, I want 100% of spam filter and no,

518
00:23:29,702 --> 00:23:32,812
the reality is like one or two spams getting through to your inbox a week.

519
00:23:32,822 --> 00:23:34,552
That's acceptable. It's annoying.

520
00:23:34,562 --> 00:23:37,621
But, you know, it's only a few minutes a year of your time. Right.

521
00:23:37,631 --> 00:23:41,362
I think the problem becomes when we're looking at global scale, you know,

522
00:23:41,371 --> 00:23:43,932
one or two minutes per person across the entire world.

523
00:23:43,942 --> 00:23:45,891
Yeah, that, that is actually kind of terrible.

524
00:23:45,901 --> 00:23:47,572
The reality is I don't think we're ever going to get

525
00:23:47,582 --> 00:23:50,491
to these perfect solutions of like blocking all phishing emails or

526
00:23:50,594 --> 00:23:55,755
-- blocking all viruses or
-- fixing all of the open source software.

527
00:23:55,765 --> 00:23:59,854
-- Everyone uses,
-- getting all the XSS fixed,

528
00:23:59,864 --> 00:24:03,255
even ignoring Xs si think things like getting,

529
00:24:03,265 --> 00:24:05,814
expecting every developer to secure their account.

530
00:24:05,824 --> 00:24:07,775
It's not a realistic expectation.

531
00:24:07,895 --> 00:24:11,564
-- It's never going to happen. Yeah.
-- And I mean, should we push developers to do it?

532
00:24:11,574 --> 00:24:12,305
Absolutely.

533
00:24:12,314 --> 00:24:13,385
I mean, I, you know,

534
00:24:13,395 --> 00:24:16,035
am heavily encouraging people to use two factor authentication.

535
00:24:16,104 --> 00:24:17,775
Right. Right. You know, it,

536
00:24:17,878 --> 00:24:21,228
it's frustrating to me that a lot of these websites allow credential stuffing.

537
00:24:21,238 --> 00:24:24,008
It's like, why, why are you allowing somebody to try and log into my account?

538
00:24:24,017 --> 00:24:26,637
You know, a million times over the span of 24 hours?

539
00:24:26,647 --> 00:24:28,537
-- Like,
-- well, they don't try your account,

540
00:24:28,547 --> 00:24:31,598
they use the same password on all the accounts,

541
00:24:31,787 --> 00:24:34,017
-- right? It's the reverse of that,
-- right?

542
00:24:34,027 --> 00:24:35,978
And well, and I feel like that, you know,

543
00:24:35,988 --> 00:24:40,667
-- the bank it system should be somewhat smart enough to detect that
-- you'd think

544
00:24:41,228 --> 00:24:42,777
like, except they're not,

545
00:24:43,387 --> 00:24:44,968
but it's also an

546
00:24:45,161 --> 00:24:47,490
-- externalized cost for like them, for example.
-- Oh,

547
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:47,850
yeah.

548
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:49,301
Yeah, it's not their problem.

549
00:24:49,311 --> 00:24:51,260
But I guess, ok, so I'm,

550
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:55,140
I'm formulating some ideas in my mind at this point and I feel like there's,

551
00:24:55,151 --> 00:24:57,961
there's the stance the Linux foundation has that says this is

552
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:00,921
what we should do and there's nothing wrong with saying that,

553
00:25:01,061 --> 00:25:03,980
but I think expecting it is unrealistic

554
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:07,541
and this is where you have to say, ok, so let's assume,

555
00:25:07,551 --> 00:25:12,360
let's say 80% of open source developers are using two factor authentication,

556
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:14,520
that means 20% of them aren't.

557
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:19,630
So what am I going to do for the fact that 20% of the open source I'm running

558
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,689
doesn't have strong authentication for developers and

559
00:25:22,699 --> 00:25:25,739
could acquire malicious code because of it.

560
00:25:25,849 --> 00:25:28,069
How do I defend against that scenario?

561
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:30,910
-- And I never hear anyone actually say that
-- part

562
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,390
of the problem is you can't because we just,

563
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,739
we can't have that depth of data to know that like

564
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,709
this project has these people with two fa enabled or not.

565
00:25:38,719 --> 00:25:39,989
No, no, we don't.

566
00:25:40,093 --> 00:25:41,793
No and we never will.

567
00:25:41,843 --> 00:25:45,713
And so this is we're doing things like segmenting services

568
00:25:45,723 --> 00:25:49,323
-- and running code in sandboxes
-- providers like github could,

569
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:52,634
for example, put a little mark on the web page saying, you know, because in github,

570
00:25:52,644 --> 00:25:55,833
you can require an organization to use two of a, it is true.

571
00:25:55,894 --> 00:25:57,394
And so for example,

572
00:25:57,404 --> 00:26:00,293
github could maybe publicly start showing that or allow it

573
00:26:00,303 --> 00:26:02,754
to be publicly shown so that people could advertise,

574
00:26:02,764 --> 00:26:05,114
let's become the Apache Foundation because they're usually pretty competent.

575
00:26:05,124 --> 00:26:07,473
I'm guessing the Apache Foundation probably

576
00:26:07,848 --> 00:26:11,358
has reasonable two factor authentication policies across all their stuff.

577
00:26:11,378 --> 00:26:12,437
I would hope so.

578
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:16,037
And if they could show, you know, if they could have like a little flag in their github

579
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:20,037
page that says, you know, look, yeah, we, we have two of a turned on across the board,

580
00:26:20,047 --> 00:26:20,807
it's enforced.

581
00:26:20,817 --> 00:26:24,108
So this is an interesting concept you speak of.

582
00:26:24,118 --> 00:26:27,868
And I think you're right because so like I'll pick on the Linux Foundation again.

583
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:30,378
They have their ci I badges, which is the core.

584
00:26:30,387 --> 00:26:35,008
In fact, we talked to David Wheeler years ago now about CIA

585
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:38,021
and I still think it's a cool idea, but the reality is,

586
00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:39,932
it's not widely deployed and I think it's

587
00:26:39,942 --> 00:26:42,842
because it's voluntary and anytime anything is voluntary,

588
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:45,082
you're just not going to have a large uptake.

589
00:26:45,092 --> 00:26:49,011
I bet you have something like 20 to 25% uptake max in an instance like that.

590
00:26:49,021 --> 00:26:51,442
Whereas github doesn't need to ask you,

591
00:26:51,452 --> 00:26:54,881
it doesn't have to make it voluntary or they can just do it because they

592
00:26:54,891 --> 00:26:57,881
actually have the information you need to say

593
00:26:57,891 --> 00:27:00,041
this project has two factor often enabled.

594
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:03,605
This project is using our security advisory. This, you know what I mean?

595
00:27:03,615 --> 00:27:07,406
Do they say when a project is using their security advisories or not?

596
00:27:07,416 --> 00:27:08,796
Not that I know of,

597
00:27:09,056 --> 00:27:10,855
I haven't seen anything.

598
00:27:10,865 --> 00:27:15,845
-- I feel like that would be a really good, I'm guessing it's a really good sign.
-- I agree.

599
00:27:15,855 --> 00:27:16,985
No. Absolutely.

600
00:27:16,995 --> 00:27:19,956
Because I feel like if you publish security advisories,

601
00:27:19,965 --> 00:27:25,635
if you get C vs that shows a certain amount of understanding of security

602
00:27:25,776 --> 00:27:26,586
versus

603
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:29,926
-- like I have no idea what I'm doing. Well.
-- Most well and

604
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:32,630
problem too is it's always, it's not just an understanding of security,

605
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,359
but it's actually brushing your teeth every day,

606
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:36,000
wash your hands, brush your teeth,

607
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:38,260
90% of problems

608
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:38,650
and

609
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:43,130
look man flossing, I think is a bridge too far for most people.

610
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,150
I think if everyone just brushes their teeth in the morning and at night,

611
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,400
that would be a huge first step.

612
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,790
But I mean, you just did it right.

613
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,250
This is what everyone does where we think, ok, here's an easy thing you could do.

614
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,829
Oh, but also you should do this hard thing that no one else wants to do. Right.

615
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,239
No, just start

616
00:27:57,514 --> 00:28:00,364
-- easy. Make it easy. That's how we have to do it.
-- I'm

617
00:28:00,374 --> 00:28:01,683
-- also
-- hesitant to have github

618
00:28:01,823 --> 00:28:05,093
just start publishing this information about projects without their,

619
00:28:05,104 --> 00:28:06,654
I guess I want to say consent.

620
00:28:06,663 --> 00:28:09,644
You have to boil the frog, right? You can't just flip a switch.

621
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:13,354
You start by letting people opt in and then you talk about how neat it is and you show

622
00:28:13,364 --> 00:28:15,854
how powerful it is and you just slowly turn on

623
00:28:15,864 --> 00:28:17,813
one feature here and there and here and there.

624
00:28:17,823 --> 00:28:20,093
And before you know it, you've done it all. In fact,

625
00:28:20,203 --> 00:28:23,963
this, this topic came up, there's, there's a new type of shoe, I guess that the,

626
00:28:23,973 --> 00:28:24,894
like some

627
00:28:24,998 --> 00:28:29,897
athletic association has banned because they decided the shoe gives the runners

628
00:28:30,027 --> 00:28:32,567
too many advantages over people without the shoe.

629
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:35,368
Anyway, this art, I'll see if I can find it. I don't know if I can.

630
00:28:35,378 --> 00:28:37,828
It was, it was very obscure. I remember when I read it.

631
00:28:37,838 --> 00:28:40,578
But anyway, it was basically the author was talking about how

632
00:28:40,748 --> 00:28:42,927
in the world of athletics,

633
00:28:43,157 --> 00:28:48,137
you can't turn the knob up too fast or people notice and your product gets banned.

634
00:28:48,307 --> 00:28:52,378
But if you turn it up nice and slow after a couple of years, you're actually exactly

635
00:28:52,572 --> 00:28:54,582
where you would have been two years earlier.

636
00:28:54,592 --> 00:28:58,501
But by turning it up slow, you can get there. If you turn it up too fast, then you get,

637
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:00,842
you know, the rules are changed and your products are banned.

638
00:29:00,852 --> 00:29:02,062
And that's exactly what

639
00:29:02,312 --> 00:29:05,401
Github's situation is where if they turn the knob too fast, people will be like,

640
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:06,141
whoa, I hate this.

641
00:29:06,151 --> 00:29:07,222
This is, you know, nonsense.

642
00:29:07,232 --> 00:29:10,352
I'm moving my project over here to whatever so they can do it.

643
00:29:10,362 --> 00:29:11,661
They just have to do it slow.

644
00:29:11,812 --> 00:29:12,582
Yeah, it sounds fair.

645
00:29:12,862 --> 00:29:14,982
I'm just looking through this and it's not even,

646
00:29:15,151 --> 00:29:18,182
yeah, like I'm just clicking around on this and there's all these,

647
00:29:18,192 --> 00:29:19,852
they have zero security advisories.

648
00:29:20,316 --> 00:29:24,586
There's, and, oh, and so you can see if they have a policy or not. So that's good.

649
00:29:24,956 --> 00:29:27,345
And you can see if they've published advisories or not,

650
00:29:27,355 --> 00:29:30,306
but there's no easy way to kind of scrape this data.

651
00:29:30,336 --> 00:29:33,885
-- I, I would imagine. Yeah, it'd be great
-- if there was a big button

652
00:29:33,916 --> 00:29:34,395
or is there?

653
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:37,125
-- Maybe, I don't
-- know, there's an api, I bet you could get it,

654
00:29:37,135 --> 00:29:38,265
but it'd be a pain in the butt.

655
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:41,696
But it would be nice to be able to say, for example, you know, well,

656
00:29:41,706 --> 00:29:43,536
in my C I or CD system again,

657
00:29:43,546 --> 00:29:47,276
assuming I have my magic C I Canon to shoot me out into magic C I land,

658
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,000
you know, having a, having a flag saying, you know,

659
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:53,510
check all these dependencies to make sure they have a security policy or make sure

660
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,319
they have published a security advisory at least

661
00:29:56,329 --> 00:29:58,459
once because they've all had security flaw.

662
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,219
Right. Right.

663
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:05,500
-- No, I agree. Those would
-- be indicators.

664
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,180
Here's the thing.

665
00:30:06,189 --> 00:30:08,819
What, what do you do with that because you're not going to not use the dependency.

666
00:30:08,829 --> 00:30:10,140
You know, as we were talking about earlier,

667
00:30:10,449 --> 00:30:11,000
what you're gonna,

668
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:15,020
you're gonna rewrite all the code you pull in to use some other dependency.

669
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:15,829
-- No,
-- you're

670
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:18,839
-- going
-- to use it because working is more important than security.

671
00:30:18,849 --> 00:30:21,000
And again, though, this is where step two comes in.

672
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,969
So let's assume they didn't wash their hands.

673
00:30:22,979 --> 00:30:25,660
So now what do we do to add another layer of protection?

674
00:30:25,709 --> 00:30:27,817
And we don't have a the answer for that today

675
00:30:27,996 --> 00:30:29,796
and nor should we honestly,

676
00:30:29,807 --> 00:30:31,457
the one thing I keep coming back to with

677
00:30:31,467 --> 00:30:35,077
this is having the ability to push updates quickly,

678
00:30:35,087 --> 00:30:36,996
full stop because you're going to need that anyways.

679
00:30:37,006 --> 00:30:38,207
You're going to want that anyways.

680
00:30:38,217 --> 00:30:40,156
-- All right, man,
-- we should, we should call this one.

681
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:43,906
I think we've, we've rambled on for long enough and I guess if I was going to sum it up,

682
00:30:43,916 --> 00:30:44,636
it's just

683
00:30:44,737 --> 00:30:48,156
a matter of, I think these discussions are good to have,

684
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:53,227
but I think we need to be more realistic in our expectations and say,

685
00:30:53,313 --> 00:30:56,404
expecting to change the world in the ways like

686
00:30:56,413 --> 00:30:59,394
the Linux Foundation is looking for right now is not

687
00:30:59,514 --> 00:31:02,534
-- realistic. So like, what is the bar? I don't
-- know.

688
00:31:02,563 --> 00:31:05,443
I'm going to gently disagree on that. I think Github

689
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:09,284
is starting to do more good and I hope they turn up the heat and

690
00:31:09,293 --> 00:31:12,813
boil the frog a bit faster because looking at some of the work they're doing,

691
00:31:12,823 --> 00:31:15,093
they clearly have good intentions around security.

692
00:31:15,104 --> 00:31:19,923
I hope they move a bit faster because I suspect that wouldn't be a bad thing.

693
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,600
-- Well, we will
-- see it would make people uncomfortable,

694
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:25,031
but we don't have 50 years to fix the software industry.

695
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:25,551
Right?

696
00:31:25,821 --> 00:31:28,010
We have zero years

697
00:31:28,151 --> 00:31:31,990
or maybe it doesn't matter and we have infinite years. I have no idea. All right.

698
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,750
Anyway, I'm calling it. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.
