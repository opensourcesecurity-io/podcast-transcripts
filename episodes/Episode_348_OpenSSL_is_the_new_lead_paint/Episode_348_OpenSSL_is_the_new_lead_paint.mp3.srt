Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,819 --> 00:00:12,569
Kurt Siefried and my partner and making fun of my lumpy head Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:16,389
We are, I don't know if it'll make it into the free role. Kurt has a bump on his head.

3
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,229
He was actually mocking himself.

4
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,110
I said nothing but I think my silence conveyed more than words. So

5
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,510
it worked out.

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,950
Yeah, my doctor said it's ok. I didn't pass out. So

7
00:00:27,129 --> 00:00:28,120
he's just like, that's weird.

8
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:30,969
I've never seen it before, which is not what you want to hear from your doctor.

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,310
I agree with that anyway. Ok.

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,000
Open SSL

11
00:00:35,529 --> 00:00:36,779
is our lead paint.

12
00:00:36,889 --> 00:00:39,630
We all know it's bad. We all know what we have to do.

13
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:43,569
-- No one really wants to do it because it's gonna be expensive and hard.
-- The problem.

14
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:43,939
You know what?

15
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,099
It's not lead paint, it's asbestos because it's embedded in everything.

16
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,110
Lead paint is everywhere.

17
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,659
No, no, but like, but like lead paint, you can just sort of paint over but like,

18
00:00:52,669 --> 00:00:54,169
asbestos is in everything.

19
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,029
Like to, to remove

20
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:55,189
it

21
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,959
is a massive problem. And that's where Openness cell is.

22
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:02,169
Like, you can't fix Openness Cell on your TV, like your TV maker has to want to do that.

23
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:02,959
-- You know,
-- I can't

24
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,860
-- fix
-- lead paint in my house.

25
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,739
Either you strip it down and repaint or, or you just paint over it.

26
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:11,580
Well, you paint over it. That's actually the right way.

27
00:01:11,809 --> 00:01:14,699
And see. The problem is you can't do that with open SSL though

28
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:15,610
because,

29
00:01:15,779 --> 00:01:15,910
and,

30
00:01:15,919 --> 00:01:19,000
and I think this is a big part of the problem that people don't kind

31
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:22,930
of think about really consciously is if you have a network service by definition,

32
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:26,319
what's the first thing that gets touched nowadays?

33
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,339
And it's the TLS layer,

34
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:29,900
right? Oh. Right.

35
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,330
You know what I mean? And that's part of the problem is like,

36
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,559
like I can write a terrible CG I, oh God, that's how

37
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,440
II, I still think of them as CG I apps. Like a web app.

38
00:01:39,449 --> 00:01:41,370
I can write a terrible web app but like,

39
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:44,550
I can stick a web server in front of it that sanitizes input.

40
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,129
But you can't do that with TLS.

41
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:49,449
Like whatever is handling the TLS

42
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:54,529
is handling the TLS unless you have another TLS proxy in front of it.

43
00:01:54,769 --> 00:01:57,830
All right, we hold on. Ok. You're, you're, you're off in the weeds.

44
00:01:57,839 --> 00:02:00,069
I, I think we're gonna start at the beginning.

45
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:02,629
-- Well, no
-- part of the problem is there's, there's no easy remediation.

46
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:05,059
You either have, you have to rip it out and replace it with something better.

47
00:02:05,529 --> 00:02:08,038
Nobody wants to do that because it's a pain in the butt

48
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,979
-- because it's expensive and it
-- sucks.

49
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:14,039
But it's worse than that because what's the replacement for open SSL one?

50
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:16,889
Oh, it's, oh, it's open SSL three?

51
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:17,339
Oh,

52
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,300
no. The replacement

53
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:21,985
is, what is the name of that isg, the

54
00:02:22,164 --> 00:02:24,755
-- thing we talked to Josh Os about
-- Russell's?

55
00:02:24,764 --> 00:02:27,875
-- Wasn't, didn't they say it was called Russell's? Russ TLS?
-- Yeah, that sounds right.

56
00:02:28,044 --> 00:02:28,764
I think it was Russell's.

57
00:02:28,925 --> 00:02:31,914
Yeah, he pronounced it. Russell's, didn't he? Which I found weird, but whatever.

58
00:02:32,054 --> 00:02:34,434
Yeah, I know. That's why it stuck in my head. That is

59
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,154
-- the
-- answer. A new language.

60
00:02:36,164 --> 00:02:38,315
We, we have to use

61
00:02:38,904 --> 00:02:42,154
a memory safe TLS library and they have one.

62
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:45,225
Well, I mean, it's simple, right? We need modern tools.

63
00:02:45,294 --> 00:02:49,134
But again, this is why I like lead paint is my analogy

64
00:02:49,255 --> 00:02:50,115
because

65
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,259
there was lead in paint

66
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,779
and then we were like, that's bad. We shouldn't do it.

67
00:02:54,789 --> 00:02:56,600
Someone made paint without lead and they were like, well,

68
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,589
that's more expensive and it sucks and we don't

69
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,820
want to use it and eventually we just had to

70
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:01,899
now

71
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:04,020
ignoring marine paint. That's a whole different thing.

72
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,360
-- What's wrong with
-- green paint? No,

73
00:03:05,369 --> 00:03:06,649
marine paint. Like

74
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,250
-- does, does marine paint still have lead in it
-- because it

75
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,100
works.

76
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:14,020
-- And generally speaking, people aren't out there looking at,
-- I mean,

77
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:16,160
but it's leaching into the ocean

78
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,020
-- like that place with the fish we eat.
-- Yeah.

79
00:03:19,029 --> 00:03:21,490
But if that happens in international waters, did it happen?

80
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,539
Uh anyways,

81
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:26,779
I lead paint is the perfect analogy because

82
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,850
if it's still in use then

83
00:03:30,589 --> 00:03:31,070
yeah,

84
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,550
like open SSL will be used in some places forever

85
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:35,199
even though we know better and we shouldn't do it

86
00:03:35,369 --> 00:03:37,759
because it's easier. Let's start at the beginning.

87
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:44,770
It is Tuesday, November 1st that we are recording this particular episode.

88
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,369
The Open SSL issue in question, there were actually two

89
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,490
dropped.

90
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,630
What, like not even 12 hours ago at the time of us recording this and

91
00:03:55,179 --> 00:03:56,220
a week

92
00:03:56,339 --> 00:03:59,130
ago exactly was the Tuesday before this

93
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:05,179
open SSL released an announcement saying on November 1st

94
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:10,830
at whatever, at some time range, I forget what it was like 1700 to 1900 UTC, I think.

95
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:15,070
Uh Tuesday first of November 2022 between 1317 100 UTC,

96
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,540
which is essentially morning in North America, evening in Europe.

97
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:21,410
And if you're in Asia, you're, you're drinking coffee and staying up late.

98
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,140
So

99
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:27,470
they, they say they're going to release an open SSL update

100
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,630
and it has a critical vulnerability in it

101
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:34,140
-- and the world lit on fire
-- and partly too because

102
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,859
the announcement wasn't good.

103
00:04:35,869 --> 00:04:36,720
Here's the announcement,

104
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,529
the Open SSL project team would like to announce

105
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,980
the forthcoming release of open SSL version 3.0 0.7.

106
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,940
0, ok. That's normal so far so good.

107
00:04:43,299 --> 00:04:45,200
This release will be made available on Tuesday

108
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:48,500
first of November 2022 between 1317 100 UTC.

109
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:48,959
Hey,

110
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,200
fine, cool.

111
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:53,910
Well, but it's still 3.07 is a security fixed release. OK.

112
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,649
The highest severity issue fixing this release is critical. Whos

113
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:57,700
boom

114
00:04:57,809 --> 00:04:58,640
end of message

115
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,630
like could we maybe have an impact?

116
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,130
Like are we talking key disclosure, remote code execution?

117
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,390
-- Is it in a default configuration? If
-- it's critical,

118
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:11,390
-- it's almost definitely remote code execution
-- or

119
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:15,290
-- key exposure.
-- That's true. That could be critical in that context.

120
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:15,529
They,

121
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,779
they actually have a security policy with their specific threat

122
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,029
model and severity and to read it critical severity.

123
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,730
This affects common configurations

124
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:23,910
and which are also what

125
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,320
this affects common configurations.

126
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:29,589
Oh, they don't need the word and there which are also likely to be exploitable.

127
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,589
Examples include significant uh disclosure of the contents of server memory,

128
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,250
potentially revealing user details,

129
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,190
vulnerabilities which can be easily exploited

130
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,649
remotely to compromise server private keys

131
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,869
or where remote code execution is considered likely in common situations.

132
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,260
These issues will be kept private and will

133
00:05:44,269 --> 00:05:46,209
trigger a new release of all support versions.

134
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,239
We will attempt to address these as soon as possible.

135
00:05:48,369 --> 00:05:48,549
Yeah,

136
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,679
sure. So information disclosure, key disclosure

137
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:52,399
and well,

138
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:56,920
obviously code execution is like the the the real dark boogie monster in the closet.

139
00:05:57,059 --> 00:05:59,200
But the problem is like, yeah, I mean, well, here's the thing,

140
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:01,040
what else are we supposed to do other than speculate?

141
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:02,760
No, I'm serious, right?

142
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:05,839
Because like they didn't even say explicitly that open

143
00:06:05,859 --> 00:06:08,519
a cell one is not affected in that announcement

144
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,760
that was only done on Twitter from,

145
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,619
you know, the, the account.

146
00:06:13,059 --> 00:06:16,029
Like that's true. And, and I was like, like,

147
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,640
well, he is, he like, he is literally Mr open his cell.

148
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:22,079
So I doubt that he's lying or incorrect, but

149
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,010
-- it's not in the announcement.
-- No, no. And that was from uh Mark Cox's Twitter who?

150
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,570
Kurt and I both know Mark, he's, he's a fine person.

151
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,779
Yeah. Oh, he's a good guy does a thankless job.

152
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,299
He,

153
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:35,809
he does a lot of this work and he gets a lot of crap and

154
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,170
I'm sure he's not gonna be really happy with us when we're done with this,

155
00:06:38,179 --> 00:06:39,459
but we love you, man.

156
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,440
We, we know we know you're, you're doing a thankless job. But,

157
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,790
but the reality is, I guess here's the way I think of this. Ok.

158
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:49,420
So we had this announcement,

159
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:51,700
we have a week of basically speculation.

160
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:53,790
But then what makes it even more bizarre is like

161
00:06:53,989 --> 00:06:56,649
GSI, the dog is talking about the press and,

162
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,209
and companies contacting him asking him to sign NDAS to

163
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,390
look over the details and

164
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,540
that's not how disclosure works.

165
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,220
And of course,

166
00:07:07,549 --> 00:07:10,329
Mark hears of this and is

167
00:07:10,619 --> 00:07:13,519
-- obviously unhappy. Well,
-- because it was on Twitter and I

168
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,809
replied and tagged him into it

169
00:07:16,239 --> 00:07:16,570
like,

170
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,200
well, and then he said he was hearing all sorts of other weird stuff and I mean,

171
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:22,839
and that's part of the problem is because there's an information vacuum

172
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:26,160
dude. It's just, it's exactly like the Twitter

173
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:29,000
debacle with those, like, two guys pretending to be Twitter,

174
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:32,399
data analysis employees or whatever outside of Twitter saying, you know,

175
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,279
I was just fired from Twitter and they're like, a couple of reporters were like, oh,

176
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,559
let's interview you and, like,

177
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:39,670
actually maybe not verify that you ever worked at Twitter.

178
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:40,959
Oops, because, you know, we're in a rush

179
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:41,579
and

180
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,190
part of the problem here is

181
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,809
ok. So it's like the classic, you know,

182
00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:49,540
um, somebody says something, the reporters try and confirm it and of course,

183
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:52,070
the response from the US government or whatever is like, no comment.

184
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:54,609
Right. Right. Well, crap. What do I do now?

185
00:07:54,619 --> 00:07:56,540
Well, the answer is you print an article,

186
00:07:56,549 --> 00:07:59,380
like you put an article on your website and get some clicks and ad revenue.

187
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:02,250
Yeah. And there were tons of news stories talking about what's going to happen.

188
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,720
There were tons of blog posts from vendors talking about what's going to

189
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,255
happen and none of them knew they were all making crap up.

190
00:08:07,265 --> 00:08:11,404
What really actually makes me angry is that I kind of had the question of like, well,

191
00:08:11,415 --> 00:08:12,385
who's actually shipping this?

192
00:08:12,394 --> 00:08:12,755
Right?

193
00:08:12,885 --> 00:08:16,625
Because I know Red Hat Nine is uh Red Hat Enterprise Linux nine. Sorry.

194
00:08:17,114 --> 00:08:21,494
And, uh, also turns out I think, what is it? Ubuntu 20.04 or whatever,

195
00:08:21,684 --> 00:08:23,635
-- the,
-- the new distributions I have it

196
00:08:23,774 --> 00:08:25,125
and, and you told me no JZ

197
00:08:25,644 --> 00:08:27,035
-- Yeah.
-- No, Js is a big one

198
00:08:27,045 --> 00:08:28,234
for Sure. So basically,

199
00:08:28,524 --> 00:08:31,554
so uh but here's the thing, rail mine dropped in May

200
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,460
and

201
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,780
rel customers are not exactly like

202
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,159
by definition, if you're using REL you're,

203
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:39,070
you're not a bleeding edge kind of person.

204
00:08:39,369 --> 00:08:44,219
Right. Right. No, I agree. I think in the Linux distribution universe, the amount of

205
00:08:44,619 --> 00:08:47,090
open SSL three use is pretty low.

206
00:08:47,229 --> 00:08:49,960
But node, node is the thing

207
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:53,239
that I think you need to worry about the most just because

208
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,830
node Js is widely deployed and to make it even better,

209
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,409
node Js has open SSL three statically linked in the binary.

210
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:06,400
So you can't even like look for files on dis, you have to know it is affected, which is

211
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,409
a treat.

212
00:09:07,651 --> 00:09:09,481
But I think even with no Js,

213
00:09:09,492 --> 00:09:14,151
the majority of web stuff is now being deployed behind a proxy in general.

214
00:09:14,161 --> 00:09:15,692
Like people use C DNS like cloud floor

215
00:09:16,111 --> 00:09:19,981
-- A II. I,
-- I don't think that's a fair assumption.

216
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:20,132
I,

217
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:26,262
you told me this on signal and I don't think you're wrong but I can't prove

218
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:29,992
-- you are or aren't
-- well part of it too is that like Hiroko for example,

219
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:32,254
like stuff deployed on Heroku doesn't

220
00:09:32,624 --> 00:09:35,294
like there's, there's a proxy element and stuff, right?

221
00:09:35,304 --> 00:09:36,604
But anyways ignoring all that

222
00:09:36,783 --> 00:09:40,434
part of the point is is that this isn't like affecting Windows 11,

223
00:09:40,443 --> 00:09:41,943
like if something affects Windows 11,

224
00:09:42,174 --> 00:09:46,333
-- it's a big deal.
-- That's right. That's right. So here's part of the problem

225
00:09:46,473 --> 00:09:52,203
is if open SSL had a legitimate remote code execution vulnerability that

226
00:09:52,213 --> 00:09:57,195
affected a an enormous number versions that would be incredibly serious.

227
00:09:57,346 --> 00:10:01,806
And because open SSL is in literally everything, I bet if you connect to

228
00:10:02,015 --> 00:10:04,635
arbitrary ports on the internet that are open,

229
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:08,895
I would bet you somewhere between 30 50% have open SSL.

230
00:10:08,906 --> 00:10:09,635
On the other side,

231
00:10:09,645 --> 00:10:13,866
I remember auditing Red Hat for seeing like what SSL were they using?

232
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:14,195
Because

233
00:10:14,296 --> 00:10:16,455
Oh yeah, it was during heartbleed. Yes. Now I remember.

234
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,599
Yeah. So

235
00:10:18,789 --> 00:10:21,539
this is why this seems so familiar anyways.

236
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:21,919
Um,

237
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:23,940
and I remember looking for stuff that was specifically

238
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,559
using new TLS and the answer was like six.

239
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:27,679
It's very small.

240
00:10:27,969 --> 00:10:28,909
Well, at one time,

241
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:34,614
Red Hat put significant effort into trying to port as much stuff as they could to use

242
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:35,544
GTLS

243
00:10:35,784 --> 00:10:36,414
and it just

244
00:10:36,645 --> 00:10:37,604
never happened.

245
00:10:38,034 --> 00:10:39,815
It's, it's hard to, it's hard to move

246
00:10:40,164 --> 00:10:42,664
-- and this is why we're still using open
-- SSL.

247
00:10:42,674 --> 00:10:46,174
Well, especially with something as big and complicated as open SSL.

248
00:10:46,184 --> 00:10:48,734
Yeah, you're going to end up with a monopoly like a single

249
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,469
entity because

250
00:10:50,619 --> 00:10:56,580
-- just recreating that code in anything else.
-- No, it's recreated in rust. Shut up.

251
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:00,369
-- It's there. We just need to use it.
-- Well, no, but what I'm saying is it's so much work.

252
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,270
Unless there's a compelling advantage and

253
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,159
rewriting open SSL

254
00:11:04,349 --> 00:11:07,210
in C with a slightly different license is not

255
00:11:07,429 --> 00:11:10,270
-- really all that compelling.
-- Here's a compelling advantage.

256
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:13,539
Our Children are going to look back on us the way we look back at our parents

257
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,710
and be like, why did you paint everything with lead?

258
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,510
You knew it was bad

259
00:11:18,669 --> 00:11:20,010
and you did it anyway.

260
00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:21,270
-- But like
-- what I'm saying is

261
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,469
GTs doesn't offer a compelling alternative.

262
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:28,809
-- The alternative is rust.
-- And that, oh wow. Like, so all that memory stuff just.

263
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,890
Nope, it's fine.

264
00:11:30,099 --> 00:11:34,179
Oh, cool. Like this is why I do Python because I'm not smart enough to manage memory.

265
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:34,969
I know this.

266
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:35,469
I'm

267
00:11:35,619 --> 00:11:38,580
-- sure
-- no one is smart enough to manage memory. I don't care who you are.

268
00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:39,059
The one.

269
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,820
Openness Celtics is literally instead of greater than

270
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:44,159
it's greater than equal to like boom.

271
00:11:44,169 --> 00:11:44,940
Just that one.

272
00:11:45,349 --> 00:11:45,549
Just

273
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,809
right. Anyway. OK. OK.

274
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:49,000
So

275
00:11:49,219 --> 00:11:50,299
I want to

276
00:11:50,989 --> 00:11:53,770
this today. Anyway. OK.

277
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,000
I wanna, I wanna kind of reel this back a little bit also way back to heartbleed,

278
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:58,400
right?

279
00:11:58,489 --> 00:12:01,320
Remember heartbleed. That was open ssl also

280
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,760
heartbleed happens.

281
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,260
And that was especially fun because at first it was like, oh,

282
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,869
it kind of maybe discloses a bit of memory and then it turns out like, no,

283
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,099
-- you can basically walk memory and like get it all,
-- all

284
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:11,000
-- the
-- memory, right?

285
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:12,140
-- So
-- anyway, well, no,

286
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:15,200
but it was funny because internally our response went from this is really about to

287
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,440
oh no, let's all get a drink.

288
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:19,380
Yy.

289
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,369
Like I remember my stomach just dropping when, when I

290
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,760
and the funny thing about this is

291
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:29,309
uh I worked for Mark Cox at that time. He was on vacation.

292
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:31,929
I remember that it ruined his vacation

293
00:12:32,239 --> 00:12:36,239
anyway. Anyway. So, so here's the thing. So Harple happens. There's

294
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:39,429
all this activity you've got like the

295
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,159
Linux Foundation launches our core infrastructure initiative.

296
00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:45,530
You had all these companies offering to spend money.

297
00:12:45,669 --> 00:12:49,219
Open SSL actually did get like more people in funding.

298
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:53,099
But then I feel like we kind of hit a wall

299
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,739
and we just stopped.

300
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:58,169
-- Well, budget
-- cycles and, and that's probably part of it. Sure.

301
00:12:58,179 --> 00:13:02,000
But the point is I think about that momentum we had and

302
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,929
then it just kind of died off and now we see it again

303
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:05,799
and

304
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,205
nothing will change. Now, I want, I want to be very clear.

305
00:13:09,234 --> 00:13:12,184
This issue was not big enough to change anything.

306
00:13:12,484 --> 00:13:14,335
We're just going to make fun of it for

307
00:13:14,344 --> 00:13:16,375
the foreseeable future is all that's going to happen.

308
00:13:16,525 --> 00:13:18,184
But anyway, ok, so,

309
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,695
oh my goodness, we are the worst storytellers on the planet

310
00:13:21,244 --> 00:13:23,875
so often SSL makes this announcement,

311
00:13:24,215 --> 00:13:28,505
everyone is whipped into this. Just panic. No one knows what's going on.

312
00:13:28,969 --> 00:13:32,270
The thing is too, there were like some pretty highly competent,

313
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,880
intelligent people speculating quite a lot,

314
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:37,929
like looking at code changes and dips and, and I was like, wait,

315
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,190
but they didn't fix it yet.

316
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,130
-- Like what, what are they talking about?
-- They were looking for hints.

317
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:42,869
I mean,

318
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,909
because wasn't it, there was one of the, the,

319
00:13:46,969 --> 00:13:49,960
the TLS attacks like beast or crime or something like that.

320
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,530
I remember researchers

321
00:13:52,989 --> 00:13:55,820
gave a little bit of info about it, like a preannouncement

322
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:56,960
and using that.

323
00:13:56,969 --> 00:14:00,179
-- It was, I forget who it was if it was like, yeah,
-- they found, they figured it out

324
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,619
like it was like, oh, well done to you.

325
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,690
And, and I mean, that's the danger, right?

326
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:10,445
Is if you give any details, people can usually figure that stuff out.

327
00:14:10,635 --> 00:14:12,054
Well, here's the thing.

328
00:14:12,065 --> 00:14:12,565
It depends,

329
00:14:12,575 --> 00:14:14,914
like if you say the impact is remote code execution and

330
00:14:14,924 --> 00:14:16,734
that's enough for them to figure out what the flaws.

331
00:14:16,744 --> 00:14:16,914
They

332
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:19,875
probably not that they could have figured that out in the first place.

333
00:14:19,885 --> 00:14:20,965
But if you say something like,

334
00:14:21,104 --> 00:14:23,674
yeah, it's in like X 509 email handling,

335
00:14:23,705 --> 00:14:26,664
then people would have definitely found this in 48 hours.

336
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,809
Yeah, maybe not. This one, maybe not. It doesn't matter anyway.

337
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,489
Ok, so we're all whipped into our frenzy

338
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:37,510
and then we're waiting for the announcement today on November 1st,

339
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,010
which is also the day after Halloween in the United States.

340
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,010
And so I've been eating candy for almost 24 hours to this point because

341
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,719
obviously I start eating the Halloween candy

342
00:14:44,729 --> 00:14:46,650
long before Halloween starts in my house.

343
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:48,530
So they announced the

344
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,960
the issue and we're, I remember looking at it. I'm like

345
00:14:52,729 --> 00:14:56,359
there's two high issues here like where's the critical? Because they also

346
00:14:56,489 --> 00:14:58,270
there was the email announcement

347
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,739
which I got

348
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:03,390
which linked to the vulnerability page which was empty.

349
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,070
So I of course,

350
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,559
hit reload on it as fast as I could for probably

351
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,869
20 minutes until the text appeared and then when text appeared,

352
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,210
it had two high issues.

353
00:15:11,219 --> 00:15:14,020
And I'm like, where's the critical issue guys?

354
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:16,530
And then so of course, I'm like,

355
00:15:16,539 --> 00:15:18,869
I need to go on Twitter and see what Mark Cock is saying.

356
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,369
-- I go on Twitter.
-- Oh Wait.

357
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,049
So the current page content wasn't there originally where

358
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:24,690
it talks about why the critical is missing.

359
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,039
-- It
-- was

360
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:25,380
now,

361
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,979
but it did not say anything on that. On the vulnerability page.

362
00:15:29,989 --> 00:15:32,200
The blog post talked about

363
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,080
why it's not critical.

364
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:38,080
So I'm like, where's the critical guys? What's going on?

365
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,580
And I'm of course confused.

366
00:15:40,859 --> 00:15:43,140
I managed to find the blog post eventually and

367
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,640
this is like 30 minutes after the release drops.

368
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:48,520
And of course, I've got everyone at work is like, what's going on, you know,

369
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,690
is this an emergency?

370
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,880
What, what should we do?

371
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,789
It's like, I don't know yet, just hang on.

372
00:15:53,099 --> 00:15:58,080
So I will say one thing in my old age is I become very good at at we'll say

373
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,820
slowing down

374
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,380
and being like, let's just chill out for a minute.

375
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,020
Like if we do something now or we do something in 30 minutes,

376
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,770
it really isn't going to matter.

377
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,500
And in my younger days, I would have been like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

378
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,140
we got to do it.

379
00:16:10,479 --> 00:16:12,979
-- But anyway,
-- goalkeeper stolen, right? You need the appearance of action.

380
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,380
Something must be done.

381
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:17,580
Well, and I'm old and I don't care anymore.

382
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:18,419
Yeah.

383
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:19,799
And now it's like, well, here's the thing,

384
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:23,140
I always come back to go watch videos of firefighters run to fires and they,

385
00:16:23,229 --> 00:16:24,260
they almost never run.

386
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,340
Like it is so, so rare

387
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,299
-- because
-- if they run, they're gonna die

388
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,460
because they're carrying, like, you know, they, we,

389
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,789
you know, they got 50 to 80 pounds of gear on,

390
00:16:32,869 --> 00:16:36,179
-- they're
-- running into an environment that doesn't have any oxygen in it.

391
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,159
The only oxygen they're getting is on their back.

392
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:40,530
If they run, they're going to use that up faster

393
00:16:40,789 --> 00:16:42,020
anyway. OK.

394
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:48,330
So go to the blog post and the blog post basically says, oh we called this critical

395
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,729
and it's actually high

396
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:53,210
because it's a stack buffer overflow

397
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:54,289
and

398
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,700
-- it's probably not an issue. Oh
-- yeah, compiler protection.

399
00:16:57,789 --> 00:17:00,280
They basically said there will be uh here.

400
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:03,640
However, as open SSL is distributed as source code,

401
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,479
we have no way of knowing how every platform and

402
00:17:05,489 --> 00:17:07,670
compiler combination has arranged the buffers on the stack.

403
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,319
And therefore a remote code execution may still be possible on some platforms.

404
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,920
But they essentially, oh sorry.

405
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,089
The the first one was firstly, we had reports that on certain Linux distributions,

406
00:17:15,098 --> 00:17:15,500
the stack

407
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,060
layout was such that the four bytes

408
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,000
overwrote an adjacent buffer that was

409
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,900
yet to be used.

410
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,848
And therefore there was no crash or ability to cause remote code execution.

411
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,560
Secondly,

412
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:26,979
many modern platforms implement stack overflow protections which would migrate

413
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:27,579
or sorry,

414
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:30,069
mitigate against the risk of remote code execution

415
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,609
and usually lead to a crash instead.

416
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,599
So they're basically going on to like hopefully people compile this correctly.

417
00:17:34,609 --> 00:17:37,979
So it doesn't like go kaboom. And that's probably mostly true.

418
00:17:38,155 --> 00:17:38,685
I hope.

419
00:17:38,915 --> 00:17:41,214
-- No,
-- I, I take a ton of issue with that.

420
00:17:41,224 --> 00:17:46,775
They should have called it high from the start because make claiming that our, our,

421
00:17:46,994 --> 00:17:50,385
our project is distributed as source and we don't know

422
00:17:50,395 --> 00:17:52,484
exactly how people are going to use or compile it.

423
00:17:52,594 --> 00:17:57,015
Well, I mean, by that reasoning, every single open ssl issue is critical.

424
00:17:57,025 --> 00:17:58,694
I mean, that's ridiculous. Come on.

425
00:17:58,864 --> 00:17:59,655
That is

426
00:17:59,935 --> 00:18:05,614
that is, that is like a technically correct move that I cannot approve in any way.

427
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:06,579
That's

428
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,250
that it whipped everyone into a panic and it made a freaking mess.

429
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,479
And now the funny thing is though,

430
00:18:11,489 --> 00:18:14,839
I have lots of people contacting me that are like these guys are a bunch of idiots.

431
00:18:14,849 --> 00:18:15,209
It's like

432
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:18,020
they're not dumb, they're not bad.

433
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,819
Like please don't think less of them, but they did screw this one up.

434
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:22,229
Well,

435
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:26,300
I think the challenge is always that if you

436
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:30,510
have to downgrade a severity rating after the fact,

437
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,859
it's more acceptable and it's kind of a pain

438
00:18:33,869 --> 00:18:35,280
because you kind of have to prove a negative.

439
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:38,040
You have to prove this critical is not a high, right?

440
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,270
Whereas the flip side is

441
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,890
upgrading a severity later on is

442
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:46,439
in some ways easier because it's like, oh, we have to upgrade the severity because ha

443
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:46,849
you know,

444
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:50,829
clever person over here came up with exploit code and it really is exploitable.

445
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:51,310
Oops.

446
00:18:51,699 --> 00:18:56,630
-- But politically and, and, like, culturally now you're done fed up, you
-- mean,

447
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,930
-- going from high to critical,
-- like, after the fact, like, remember shell shock,

448
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:01,209
right?

449
00:19:01,219 --> 00:19:03,300
Like, there was just such a train wreck.

450
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:08,290
I mean, look, I don't think anyone would have blamed

451
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:13,290
open SSL for calling this high out of the gate. I mean, it's four bites

452
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:17,280
-- written to the stack.
-- Well, my one thought is that it's simply put moving forward.

453
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:21,329
They could say, look when compiled with reasonable and sane flags,

454
00:19:21,339 --> 00:19:24,290
like which to be blunt, everybody should be doing at this point.

455
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,160
It's 2022. Like, come on.

456
00:19:26,619 --> 00:19:26,939
Right.

457
00:19:27,069 --> 00:19:28,760
To be blunt. If you're like,

458
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:30,760
not doing this then.

459
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:32,140
Well, that's on you.

460
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:35,189
-- I like, I'm sorry. That's, that's just how that is.
-- I agree.

461
00:19:35,489 --> 00:19:36,469
I agree completely.

462
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:39,390
So, yeah, to be clear, I think I, I wish openness as hell had just gone with,

463
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,849
had gone with high across the board and been like,

464
00:19:42,369 --> 00:19:46,069
assuming you have a same compiler and like if you have an insane compiler, well, two,

465
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:48,020
like you have bigger problems than this.

466
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,969
-- Right.
-- Right. Absolutely. So anyway, it comes out

467
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,020
and it's high and then

468
00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:56,650
the thing that amused me the most is, of course,

469
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:57,060
at

470
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:01,670
-- work we had been preparing ourselves,
-- there's no logo. I'm so sad.

471
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,949
Well, well, so, but here's a funny thing

472
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:05,060
in one of

473
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,319
GSI, the dog's tweets. He claimed there was a logo and it had a good name. He said

474
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:12,319
I'll see if I could dig it up and find it, put in the show notes.

475
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:14,410
But yeah, apparently he claimed it was a good name,

476
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,000
which made me sad because internally I've been calling it

477
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:19,920
uh open SSL for Jay all week,

478
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,900
which amuses me to no end still.

479
00:20:23,229 --> 00:20:23,859
But

480
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:29,540
anyway, and, and I would have loved an MS paint like open SSL for shell.

481
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,250
But,

482
00:20:30,609 --> 00:20:32,260
but the point is so

483
00:20:32,939 --> 00:20:34,420
all of this happens,

484
00:20:34,829 --> 00:20:41,130
all of these organizations, no doubt had done a bunch of prep for a critical open SSL.

485
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:42,260
I know

486
00:20:42,569 --> 00:20:45,420
a number of people I've talked to

487
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,180
who like, worked

488
00:20:47,439 --> 00:20:50,699
in like sock, like environments like they were ready to go. Right.

489
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:54,219
They were ready for patches. They were ready to detection.

490
00:20:54,449 --> 00:20:56,439
Like they'd already started looking into where

491
00:20:56,449 --> 00:20:58,310
they had open SSL in their environments.

492
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:58,560
Well,

493
00:20:58,569 --> 00:21:00,689
I feel like that stuff should have already been done like

494
00:21:00,699 --> 00:21:02,589
-- that should be part of your posture and I
-- mean,

495
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:05,949
it's getting there like it, it, it's a long road.

496
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:06,579
Here's the thing.

497
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:09,310
I live in a relatively safe part of the country where, ok,

498
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:10,550
we technically have tornadoes.

499
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,709
There was a big bad one like 40 years ago

500
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:14,540
and there have been tornadoes

501
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,270
reported in the news, like within 50 miles of the city.

502
00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:20,239
But like, it doesn't really, like, I, basically,

503
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,109
what I'm saying is I don't have a go bag ready to go.

504
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,790
But if I lived in hurricane alley or tornado alley,

505
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,020
yeah, I should probably have a go bag ready to go because that's part of life.

506
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:31,420
I feel like if you are not yet at the point where

507
00:21:31,689 --> 00:21:34,449
I will excuse people, not having a full inventory. That's hard.

508
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,910
I don't even have a full inventory. I'm confident I'm missing at least one thing.

509
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,550
But I,

510
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,680
if you don't have a full inventory

511
00:21:40,689 --> 00:21:43,599
of like public facing revenue generating systems and

512
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,530
like what

513
00:21:44,689 --> 00:21:48,699
stuff kind of core stuff they're using? That's negligent in today's world.

514
00:21:48,709 --> 00:21:49,880
It's, it's 2022.

515
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,349
No, it's not. Not yet. It look, it's, it's coming a lot,

516
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:56,709
I think Log for Shell is what really kicked a lot

517
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:59,260
-- of this off
-- and that was all about a year ago.

518
00:21:59,349 --> 00:21:59,739
Yeah,

519
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,699
I know that it's not quite a year because I've been at Acor a year in log for Shell came,

520
00:22:03,709 --> 00:22:03,849
saw the

521
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,290
being,

522
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,099
you're taking a

523
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:10,439
divisive stance on this, like everyone is working towards this,

524
00:22:10,449 --> 00:22:11,839
but we all have limited budget.

525
00:22:11,849 --> 00:22:14,640
We have limited resources saying everyone should be doing this now

526
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,380
is absurd.

527
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,349
-- Well,
-- what I'm saying is if you're not doing it at this point,

528
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:19,180
it's just not gonna happen.

529
00:22:19,189 --> 00:22:22,479
-- It's clearly not a priority, whatever.
-- No, no, I think you're being a jerk.

530
00:22:22,489 --> 00:22:23,040
I'm gonna,

531
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:24,670
anyway, we're moving on.

532
00:22:24,979 --> 00:22:25,670
So

533
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:31,949
the issue comes out. Everyone's like, like the panic dies down.

534
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:36,589
There's a bunch of blog posts that are kind of lame because you could tell, like,

535
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:38,310
for example, in the one I wrote

536
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,650
it had a bunch of the word critical in lots of places.

537
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,550
I'm like, well, I better search for critical and make sure I take them all out.

538
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:45,810
But

539
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,430
it's

540
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:53,359
at the same time, I'm ecstatic. It, it was boring because I, right now I'm very busy.

541
00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:56,719
I don't need another log for shell at the moment,

542
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:57,160
right?

543
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,459
-- It's just not something even if it
-- had been critical,

544
00:22:59,469 --> 00:23:01,599
remote code execution in the default configuration.

545
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:06,500
Yeah, it was no Js some ubuntu and red hat.

546
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,780
-- So
-- no, no, here's the problem from my perspective is I work for a company

547
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,430
that builds software to break things open and look inside and,

548
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:16,829
and like build those inventories.

549
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,010
And so from our perspective,

550
00:23:19,209 --> 00:23:22,729
we have people saying I don't think I have this anywhere,

551
00:23:22,739 --> 00:23:25,930
but I want to make sure you're going to help me find it.

552
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:30,010
And so that's the difference. And in fact, one thing that's really cool is

553
00:23:30,189 --> 00:23:31,239
uh the, the S

554
00:23:31,349 --> 00:23:33,290
bomb scanner sift that, that

555
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:33,849
Acor

556
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,280
is the primary contributor to. It's an open source project.

557
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:38,390
And

558
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:42,890
one of our developers like worked all weekend long name is Chris Phillips.

559
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,630
Super cool dude,

560
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,170
worked all weekend long

561
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:49,939
and added the ability to start like detecting binaries on disk and figuring

562
00:23:49,949 --> 00:23:52,969
out what well for now it's just node because that's the most important.

563
00:23:52,989 --> 00:23:54,689
Like he, he built the structure

564
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,729
so we can start classifying binaries.

565
00:23:56,739 --> 00:24:01,290
But then what's even more crazy is he realized that we, we're, when we're,

566
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,189
we're breaking these binaries open and like basically running strings

567
00:24:04,199 --> 00:24:06,469
on them to do some figuring out what's going on.

568
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,630
Here's the thing,

569
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,569
there's an open SSL string.

570
00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:13,719
You can reliably detect when someone compiles open SSL into a binary. And I'm like,

571
00:24:14,209 --> 00:24:15,630
oh, that's exciting.

572
00:24:15,925 --> 00:24:20,714
Anyway, I feel like putting all of these pieces together, right?

573
00:24:20,724 --> 00:24:24,655
Like mixing it all up into the big pot and just kind of looking back at what's going on.

574
00:24:24,665 --> 00:24:26,175
And I feel like

575
00:24:26,295 --> 00:24:30,155
-- we have no excuse for where we are today.
-- It's simple economics.

576
00:24:30,295 --> 00:24:34,135
I have open to sell my product, open to sell probably version one because, well,

577
00:24:34,145 --> 00:24:36,375
version three only came out recently, like in

578
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,109
general terms of products, not software.

579
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,219
You want me to upgrade to open SSL three. Why?

580
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:44,869
Because one is less than 33 is bigger than one? No, I'm serious. Like

581
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,390
literally the only reason somebody would kind of have to upgrade

582
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,569
to open SSL three is for quick support qu IC,

583
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:51,819
the new protocol thing that's

584
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:53,449
going to eventually become very important,

585
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:56,729
especially if they're like moving video and stuff and all that kind

586
00:24:56,739 --> 00:25:00,060
-- of junk around whatever
-- you need to upgrade because open SSL one,

587
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,780
-- it's going to be end of life in 2023.
-- Yeah, that's next year's budget problem.

588
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:07,020
And also hear me out, we just keep using it.

589
00:25:07,189 --> 00:25:07,780
No, that's it.

590
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:11,310
-- That's
-- maybe
-- what do you think your TV is going to get an update from Openness

591
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:15,099
-- L 1 to 3?
-- My TV doesn't connect to the internet so I don't care.

592
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:16,270
So,

593
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:19,380
but no, I, I agree. I understand what you're saying.

594
00:25:19,459 --> 00:25:23,510
I'm just saying the intent is, people should start upgrading from 1 to 3.

595
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,310
But here's what I'm telling you.

596
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,800
Here's the call to action for everyone out there

597
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,750
don't upgrade from open SSL 1 to 3.

598
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:35,640
Switch to the Isgs

599
00:25:35,989 --> 00:25:37,060
Russell's

600
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,839
which is the Russ TLS library

601
00:25:40,329 --> 00:25:40,430
-- and
-- the

602
00:25:40,699 --> 00:25:42,619
thing that is what we should all be doing.

603
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:46,979
It's probably about the same amount of work there is in theory, more risk, but

604
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:50,729
you're, you're eating more near term risk of like,

605
00:25:51,209 --> 00:25:52,520
well, here, let me rephrase it.

606
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,010
There's more risk in the near term of upgrading from Openness

607
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,030
Cell one to Russell's than from Openness Cell 1 to 3

608
00:25:59,439 --> 00:26:02,910
because like maybe Russell's doesn't support it whatever feature you need or not,

609
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,930
but that's going to be readily apparent.

610
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:06,699
And that's the problem with security flaws, right?

611
00:26:06,709 --> 00:26:08,260
Is security flaws aren't apparent

612
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,829
until they are. And then

613
00:26:10,219 --> 00:26:13,170
you got to deal with them whether you like it or not on a weekend maybe.

614
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,119
Whereas if you choose to go from Openness Cell one to Russell's,

615
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,000
oh, it doesn't work. It's missing a feature. Ok. Let's go bug them.

616
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,630
Help them whatever, get that fixed

617
00:26:21,989 --> 00:26:26,060
and you can do that Monday to Friday, 9 to 5 and not on a weekend or over Christmas.

618
00:26:26,939 --> 00:26:29,520
And I think that's part of what people forget, you know,

619
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:30,479
is that,

620
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:33,280
yeah, there might, even if there is more risk and more work

621
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:37,010
you can define when it happens, it's not an emergency response situation.

622
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,420
It's like, yeah, we can just budget that. It's gonna take six months,

623
00:26:40,449 --> 00:26:40,839
you know,

624
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:43,000
and I think a lot of people forget that because

625
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:46,359
there is a big difference between like Josh,

626
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:49,119
you spend four weeks working Monday to Friday 9 to 5

627
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:52,760
versus spend two weeks of doing complete crazy panic response.

628
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,560
Which one do you want? Well, obviously the four weeks of 9 to 5.

629
00:26:56,829 --> 00:26:57,900
Yes, of course.

630
00:26:58,479 --> 00:27:00,020
And, and that's what people forget is.

631
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,810
And I don't want to say Russell's will have no security flaws.

632
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:06,949
Like it will absolutely have security flaws, but they won't be things like that.

633
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:07,790
They will,

634
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:11,089
it will be in some ways, I think it'll be harder because

635
00:27:11,219 --> 00:27:13,420
all that common stuff is like gone.

636
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,989
You know, it's like when you start using a web framework and all the

637
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,805
cross site scripting and all the authentication and stuff, just poof gone,

638
00:27:20,084 --> 00:27:22,125
you know, and some poor pent tester has to have a run at your thing.

639
00:27:22,135 --> 00:27:25,035
And it's like, it's, it's much harder. They have to be more creative.

640
00:27:26,484 --> 00:27:27,594
I think more importantly,

641
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:32,005
how do I put this nicely the kind of bugs you find in a rust application are

642
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,574
you learn from them?

643
00:27:33,925 --> 00:27:35,155
Yeah. Whatever. That's a lie.

644
00:27:35,324 --> 00:27:40,074
We clearly have not learned from like c memory management flaws because,

645
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:44,290
-- well, here we are.
-- No, we can't learn. There's nothing to learn.

646
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,420
-- It's too complicated for humans.
-- Whereas with,

647
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,189
you know, something like a rust based program with

648
00:27:50,449 --> 00:27:51,670
whatever flaws they're gonna,

649
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,430
they're more likely to be in logic and in

650
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:55,469
other things where we can actually learn and maybe,

651
00:27:55,569 --> 00:27:57,349
you know, build better test cases, build.

652
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,869
-- No,
-- no, not at all.

653
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,609
They aren't more likely.

654
00:28:00,619 --> 00:28:02,140
That's literally where the bugs will be

655
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,150
because memory management isn't the problem.

656
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,349
Like,

657
00:28:05,689 --> 00:28:07,819
and we just can't learn. If you

658
00:28:07,939 --> 00:28:11,180
writing an X 509 interpreter,

659
00:28:11,479 --> 00:28:12,540
there's nothing to learn.

660
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:15,079
It's insanely complicated and you're going to

661
00:28:15,089 --> 00:28:16,839
make mistakes because you're a human being

662
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,400
and there's nothing to learn.

663
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,229
You're also going to make mistakes because it's not,

664
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:21,520
the specification is not clear.

665
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:22,079
Like I, I

666
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,400
remember when, uh jeez, what was it?

667
00:28:24,489 --> 00:28:28,520
The one, not the A sn one stuff, but whatever the last A sn one related one was.

668
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:31,280
And I'm like, oh, I'll just download the A sl one spec and give it a quick glance.

669
00:28:31,569 --> 00:28:35,040
No, like it's 800 pages for the overview of the spec.

670
00:28:35,469 --> 00:28:36,989
Yeah, they're all like that. That's normal, you

671
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:37,189
know,

672
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,459
because they have 30 some years of baggage attached

673
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:43,790
-- to that.
-- They were designed by the International Telephony Union who

674
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:45,650
vastly over specs things.

675
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:49,589
But, but what the point is, even though you have 800 pages of specifications,

676
00:28:49,709 --> 00:28:53,650
there's still a lot of not well defined behaviors and things in it.

677
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,260
You know, like the same thing we discovered with TCP/IP.

678
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:59,810
The, let's encrypt people, they get this, you know.

679
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:00,489
Come on,

680
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,069
I'm not anyway. All right, we're, we're kind of running ourselves out of time.

681
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:08,520
I want to wrap up our, our tale, which is,

682
00:29:08,719 --> 00:29:11,500
we'll say weaved itself an interesting web

683
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,550
and

684
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:17,819
I, I want to kind of set the stage for the future is open.

685
00:29:17,829 --> 00:29:23,310
SSL is going to have more memory safety issues. They may not be critical.

686
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:26,310
I mean, the last critical was in 2016 if you look at their vulnerability page.

687
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:30,130
So 2016 to 2022 is a pretty good run, especially for

688
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:31,760
one of the most

689
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:36,630
hammered and researched and just everything libraries on the internet.

690
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:41,670
Right. So, like they're doing all in all. I think they're doing very well. Right.

691
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,900
But the reality is,

692
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,949
it is 2022

693
00:29:46,109 --> 00:29:47,819
C is

694
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:48,160
a

695
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,760
pain in the butt

696
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,560
to deal with memory management in.

697
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,339
-- Well,
-- you provably can't do it safely.

698
00:29:54,349 --> 00:29:55,920
Yes, absolutely.

699
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:00,650
-- Nobody can like open SSH can't do it. Open SSL can't do it like,
-- absolutely correct.

700
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,949
And so the reality is

701
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:07,709
we need to plan to go to something else and I would love it

702
00:30:07,719 --> 00:30:09,750
if the OPEN SSL developers were a

703
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,489
part of this transition because generally speaking,

704
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,790
what happens in open source is these projects will hang on

705
00:30:17,089 --> 00:30:19,369
years longer than they ever should.

706
00:30:19,729 --> 00:30:23,310
When the reality is the open SSL developers have

707
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:27,030
an enormous amount of knowledge around the protocol and

708
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:31,790
how to write libraries and how to run a project to a degree they need to work with.

709
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,540
The next thing, in my opinion, it's, is G's library.

710
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:38,750
Maybe it's not, maybe there's something else but it's not c

711
00:30:39,219 --> 00:30:42,270
that is the only thing I think we can all agree on.

712
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,569
Well and more importantly, no matter what happens,

713
00:30:44,579 --> 00:30:48,469
whatever is going to come replace open SSL has to do so economically.

714
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:50,069
So the more compatible it is

715
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,989
the cheaper it will be.

716
00:30:52,239 --> 00:30:52,709
And

717
00:30:52,969 --> 00:30:54,829
well, yeah, those are the people that would

718
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,109
be the ones to help that happen, right?

719
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:00,930
I would love to see a rapper around Russell's that

720
00:31:00,939 --> 00:31:05,589
just literally mimicked open SSL like warts and all for now

721
00:31:05,689 --> 00:31:08,270
as a drop in replacement and then

722
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,890
fix it all later.

723
00:31:09,939 --> 00:31:13,770
Well, but the thing is that is a challenge because even opens us all three had to,

724
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:17,800
you know, say like this internal function no more touching it like it's, you're

725
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,010
not supposed to be doing that.

726
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:23,829
And so part of the problem is you can't necessarily wrap Russell's because

727
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:27,300
-- there's also like, but we need this like incorrect behavior,
-- right?

728
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,949
-- No, I get that,
-- you know,

729
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:30,369
but fundamentally

730
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,670
what it boils down to for me is applying more

731
00:31:33,949 --> 00:31:38,020
effort and human engineering to a thing based on sea.

732
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,579
Yeah, you're just gonna have

733
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,699
like, you're just gonna have more memory vulnerabilities. That's it forever.

734
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:48,410
Whereas you start using an entirely new tool set like Rust Rust,

735
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:51,300
like the Linux kernel is doing and I suspect that's going to be one of

736
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:54,449
the things that's really gonna drive rust adoption is in one or two years.

737
00:31:54,459 --> 00:31:59,010
People are gonna start noticing, hey, like all that Rust code in the Linux kernel,

738
00:31:59,109 --> 00:32:01,329
uh It's not really causing any problems, is it?

739
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,810
I have a funny story for you as I was talking to someone today

740
00:32:04,229 --> 00:32:08,540
and they made a joke that in two years, the Linux kernel will be rewritten and Rust.

741
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,979
And I was like, oh, I, I hope that is true. I truly do.

742
00:32:11,989 --> 00:32:15,969
And they were not expecting that response to their joke.

743
00:32:16,719 --> 00:32:19,900
Yeah, I dude, you just gave me a warm tingle because

744
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:21,150
seriously like

745
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,339
that would be like 90% of the security vulnerabilities would just

746
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:28,550
-- kind of go away.
-- Well, no, no, that's, we can't say that

747
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:32,510
we have to be mindful. Rust isn't magic.

748
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,030
It just doesn't have memory safety issues.

749
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,420
That's the thing is it doesn't,

750
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,900
you have to be magic. This is like,

751
00:32:39,209 --> 00:32:42,160
like I drive a 2015 Kia Optima. It

752
00:32:42,339 --> 00:32:44,170
is a nice cheap four.

753
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:46,670
It's like the kind of car your kid would draw when they're five.

754
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,150
But compared to a model T Ford,

755
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,319
it is basically magic because Yeah,

756
00:32:51,329 --> 00:32:54,250
it's got all these just normal safety features now and that's

757
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,229
kind of how I feel about rust and C is.

758
00:32:56,239 --> 00:32:57,329
Yeah. C was,

759
00:32:57,479 --> 00:32:58,310
well, you gotta remember

760
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,530
but that, that's all we like.

761
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:03,189
That's all we had 2030 40 years ago and worse.

762
00:33:03,199 --> 00:33:05,810
It was a major step up though, from things like assembler.

763
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:07,880
It was a major step up like,

764
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:10,630
and also all the heavy lifting is taken away and,

765
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,589
but now we take more heavy lifting away like memory management because

766
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:14,709
like,

767
00:33:14,719 --> 00:33:16,790
why would I make you do memory management when we

768
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,270
can have a framework to it or a language?

769
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:23,180
Because we're dealing with legacy architecture. Like, don't pretend

770
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,189
like this is some decision people made and they picked memory management.

771
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:29,030
This is legacy code.

772
00:33:29,089 --> 00:33:30,199
I'm going to,

773
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:34,699
I'm going to end this because we're just going to end up in the weeds if I don't.
