Hello and welcome to episode 65 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:10,500
Kurt Siefried

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,760
and my partner in Thought crime. Josh Bresser

3
00:00:13,149 --> 00:00:15,300
and the world continues to burn.

4
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:16,829
I know. But it's,

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,799
but it's not our fault this week.

6
00:00:19,069 --> 00:00:21,559
It's never our fault. We are the

7
00:00:21,729 --> 00:00:21,860
uh,

8
00:00:22,049 --> 00:00:25,020
no, there was, there was a couple of weeks where it was sort of my fault

9
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:27,850
-- or at least I assign the CV S for it.
-- That could be.

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:32,220
But I view us as the crazy people in the desert screaming at everyone else. Yeah.

11
00:00:32,779 --> 00:00:33,049
Yeah.

12
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,020
But not the crazy people in,

13
00:00:35,029 --> 00:00:38,569
in the desert retrieving spent metal rounds from the fire range.

14
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,430
I read about that. Like, what,

15
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:41,439
you know, what

16
00:00:41,569 --> 00:00:44,389
-- do
-- you know what high tungsten steel goes for on the open market?

17
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:48,790
I'm sure it's expensive. It's got to be worth a ton if you're willing to do that.

18
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,319
I mean, come on. But anyway, anyway,

19
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,189
we'll talk about that in a risk to reward show later.

20
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:58,349
Yes, that would be really entertaining. Actually, we should do that.

21
00:00:58,639 --> 00:01:00,439
All right. So I vote we throw

22
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:05,029
-- Equifax under the bus because everybody's doing it or
-- why not Apple or?

23
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,980
Well, see, I don't know,

24
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:12,150
here's my, here's the thing. On the one hand, we have the,

25
00:01:12,349 --> 00:01:16,500
the hubris of Equifax who really should have known better, but on the other hand,

26
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:16,949
we have,

27
00:01:17,089 --> 00:01:18,989
well, we do have Apple who made a mistake.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,550
So fundamentally stupid that you know, I OK, I let's go in alphabetical order.

29
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,559
So

30
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,449
a APL it is

31
00:01:29,059 --> 00:01:31,629
OK. Do you want to say it or do I say it? Because this is just so stupid.

32
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,870
You are the Apple fan boy.

33
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:38,550
-- Nothing would please me more than to listen to you describe this.
-- So Apple has

34
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,019
hard drive encryption.

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,550
Yay, right?

36
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:45,750
And they have a couple of ways you can sort of enable the hard drive encryption.

37
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:50,160
Um You can, for example, when you plug in an external hard drive

38
00:01:50,449 --> 00:01:53,120
and you use it as a time machine, it'll let you encrypt it blah blah blah.

39
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:56,309
Um It's there's the disk utility which actually used

40
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,489
to be a really nice tool and now is

41
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,319
not such a nice tool to be completely honest.

42
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,309
Um

43
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:05,489
So basically what happens is if you created

44
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,849
an encrypted partition using the disk utility,

45
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,869
uh the standard format for that is you create new partition, you choose,

46
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,800
you know apple,

47
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,979
whatever blah blah blah encrypted.

48
00:02:14,619 --> 00:02:17,919
And then it asks you to set a password for that encrypted partition, right?

49
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:18,929
So far so good.

50
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,000
And then it asks you to set a password hint,

51
00:02:21,429 --> 00:02:25,279
which I'm not a big fan of, but sure for normal people. Ok, cool.

52
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:26,910
You know, what's your cat's name? Whatever.

53
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,589
The glitch here.

54
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,160
And it's just a little tiny glitch is that they

55
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:35,029
sort of mixed up the password hint and the password

56
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:38,449
when later on you forget your password. And

57
00:02:38,779 --> 00:02:39,639
it says, basically,

58
00:02:39,649 --> 00:02:42,100
do you want me to be helpful and prompt you with your password hint?

59
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,440
And it shows you the password?

60
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,399
I read about this bug and I thought surely that's not what it is.

61
00:02:49,585 --> 00:02:51,636
And then I went in and looked at the screen.

62
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:52,035
I got

63
00:02:52,136 --> 00:02:52,535
a CV. And

64
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:56,406
my first thought was, yeah, this is the onion, right?

65
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:59,186
Why is my onion feet getting mixed into my register feed?

66
00:02:59,195 --> 00:03:00,656
Like what, what just happened here?

67
00:03:00,835 --> 00:03:01,095
The,

68
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:05,455
the only thing I can think of is how did testing not figure this out

69
00:03:05,746 --> 00:03:06,785
because like me,

70
00:03:06,796 --> 00:03:08,725
they probably said a test password of password

71
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:10,776
and a hint of password or something stupid.

72
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:14,912
Exactly what I was thinking or they just thought, oh, whatever.

73
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:18,151
-- We don't need to use a password hint because we're just doing testing
-- well,

74
00:03:18,162 --> 00:03:20,102
or they didn't test that functionality

75
00:03:20,311 --> 00:03:22,861
because there's other ways to create an encrypted disc in apple.

76
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:27,371
And so it's just through this specific path in the UI through this one utility.

77
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:29,992
Now that, and that leads to a big problem.

78
00:03:30,171 --> 00:03:33,391
I mean, here's the problem with testing, right? Is you have to test all the things,

79
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,500
right? Yes. Literally all the things.

80
00:03:36,809 --> 00:03:37,110
Yeah.

81
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:39,139
And you know, that, that can be bothersome,

82
00:03:39,149 --> 00:03:43,270
especially with clickable Pokey U I Interfaces, right?

83
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:43,550
Like,

84
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:47,869
you know, testing something like, like there was a great article on testing floats,

85
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:47,979
right?

86
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,820
There's 4 billion floats. So why don't you test all of them

87
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,710
when you have a program that interacts with floats?

88
00:03:53,929 --> 00:03:57,380
And it was kind of like, hey, you know, or not test all the floats, sorry, all the INS,

89
00:03:57,389 --> 00:03:57,690
right?

90
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:01,960
-- Like you have 4 billion ins, you know what on a modern laptop? You can do that,
-- right.

91
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,050
-- That's what fuzzing is,
-- right? Yeah. Um

92
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:08,500
but anyway, so like, yeah, with this, it's like, well, more to the point,

93
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:09,889
they made a pretty

94
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,720
significant programming mistake and how did the code review not catch it?

95
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,428
-- Ok. So,
-- right, because this isn't like a subtle mistake, like an off by one.

96
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,570
This is like we

97
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,170
somehow they put the password into the password hint, but here's the

98
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,859
pull the password hint from the password and more to the point.

99
00:04:25,869 --> 00:04:27,809
Why is the password being stored in clear text somewhere?

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,059
Well, you have to store the password in clear text in memory to do something with it.

101
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,510
-- That is just no,
-- no, no. But this is like after the fact

102
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:35,220
this is like

103
00:04:35,739 --> 00:04:36,279
down the road,

104
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,010
right?

105
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:41,890
And my assumption is somebody accidentally assigned one variable to another

106
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:44,790
and it probably wasn't very clear because you're right.

107
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:47,350
The review should have caught it. It obviously didn't.

108
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:50,230
And so from the from the mistake of that angle.

109
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:53,670
I, I think that's ok because people make mistakes all the time.

110
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:57,989
Now, granted, I will say anytime there is any code involving a password,

111
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,470
you should have a whole bunch of really smart people looking at it.

112
00:05:00,619 --> 00:05:03,640
Well, especially a password for disc

113
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:04,815
encryption, like data,

114
00:05:04,825 --> 00:05:08,304
arrest data that you're going to want to be secret for 50 or 100 years

115
00:05:09,545 --> 00:05:12,415
because let's face it. Laptops get stolen all the time.

116
00:05:12,565 --> 00:05:13,114
You know,

117
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,545
I have a huge pile of external hard drives here.

118
00:05:15,554 --> 00:05:17,295
I have about half a dozen external hard drives with, you know,

119
00:05:17,304 --> 00:05:19,244
time machine backups and all my data.

120
00:05:19,445 --> 00:05:21,015
Yeah, they're all encrypted because

121
00:05:21,274 --> 00:05:22,315
it's all my data

122
00:05:22,475 --> 00:05:25,244
just run those over with a steamroller. It'd be fine.

123
00:05:25,535 --> 00:05:25,924
Yeah.

124
00:05:26,195 --> 00:05:28,345
But, well, the people that steal it probably won't do that.

125
00:05:28,755 --> 00:05:29,285
Um,

126
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:32,255
but yeah, so, and then, and then in testing, how

127
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,309
did this,

128
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,540
how did basic testing not get this?

129
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:39,489
Well, it obviously didn't. I mean, now I will say,

130
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,690
and they caught it and ignored it, which is,

131
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,130
see, that's, it's, here's my

132
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,660
question. Did they just not test this functionality in which case?

133
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,140
That's really terrible because you should

134
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:49,149
be testing your dis conscription functionality

135
00:05:49,619 --> 00:05:52,739
or number two. Did they test it? And the tester whiffed it in which case?

136
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:55,804
-- Holy heck, how is their testing that bad?
-- I'm betting

137
00:05:55,954 --> 00:06:00,575
that they didn't know about it because look Apple's pretty good with security.

138
00:06:00,584 --> 00:06:03,054
If they knew they would not ship a product with this book.

139
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:07,114
Right. I mean, that's, they, they, I, I have no doubt they would stop ship something

140
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:07,954
to fix that.

141
00:06:08,204 --> 00:06:09,595
I would hope so because, I mean,

142
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:10,355
yeah. Yeah,

143
00:06:10,595 --> 00:06:11,744
they're pretty good.

144
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:12,095
Yeah.

145
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:15,464
So, anyways, I mean, that's, it's just, well, and see, here's the thing,

146
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:16,825
here's the clear thing with apple.

147
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,505
This is not one person's fault.

148
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,730
Right. There's at a minimum. We have the programmer,

149
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,519
the guy who reviewed his code,

150
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:24,700
they both whiffed it.

151
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:26,970
The QE, that

152
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:31,730
if the QE did not test for this, then the, the whole QE thing whiffed it because like,

153
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:32,739
they should be testing that

154
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:36,950
and if they do test it, then at least one QE guy or automated system whiffed it.

155
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:38,890
Right.

156
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,700
So that's at least three different people or

157
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:42,299
organizations with an Apple that we've done.

158
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:42,869
Yeah.

159
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,019
But I mean, how many times haven't we discussed in the past that,

160
00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:49,380
that the vast majority of failures are the result of like,

161
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,510
five or more things going completely.

162
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:51,820
The

163
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,950
air crash thing.

164
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:53,790
Right. Right.

165
00:06:54,109 --> 00:06:57,260
This chain could have easily been interrupted at any point.

166
00:06:57,339 --> 00:07:01,559
I will laugh at Apple for making a hilarious mistake.

167
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,130
And if they ever make it again,

168
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,890
then I will call them idiots

169
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,790
because let's face it at this point.

170
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:11,049
If they don't have four or more tests that

171
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:14,489
they've integrated into their process just for this bug,

172
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,250
they're dumb

173
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:16,959
right

174
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,369
now. Speaking of one person making a mistake though.

175
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,029
Equifax. Right?

176
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,570
One person,

177
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:27,440
-- I couldn't believe that
-- because my thought was like, what if this guy gets, like,

178
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,040
what if this guy eats a bad sandwich?

179
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,579
Just?

180
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,519
Ok. No,

181
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,019
here's the reality of it. When you're testifying in front of Congress,

182
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,380
it's not your fault. Right.

183
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:37,820
If, if,

184
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:40,339
if you have the nice enough suit to be in

185
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,350
front of Congress and they're blaming you for something,

186
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:43,260
you're gonna blame

187
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,350
anyone else.

188
00:07:45,429 --> 00:07:46,859
Ok. We should actually

189
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,899
give some background here because

190
00:07:49,225 --> 00:07:50,114
so

191
00:07:50,984 --> 00:07:56,625
Equifax was horribly owned and they're up to what, like 100 and 47 million now,

192
00:07:56,635 --> 00:07:57,434
-- I think
-- records.

193
00:07:57,454 --> 00:08:02,234
Yes. And it's also the US, the UK and Canada possibly some other countries,

194
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,595
more data than we thought.

195
00:08:04,605 --> 00:08:08,075
My suspicion is when Yahoo heard this, they, they got worried that

196
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:10,755
they were going to be caught, but we'll get to them later.

197
00:08:11,154 --> 00:08:13,345
But anyway, so Equifax gets horribly

198
00:08:13,515 --> 00:08:13,755
pumped

199
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:17,410
and the Senate wanted a hearing from the CEO or

200
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:22,279
the ex CEO of Equifax to basically say like WTF man

201
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,880
and this guy shows up and

202
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,000
his testimony

203
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:26,420
was,

204
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,100
that's how it works though, right?

205
00:08:28,109 --> 00:08:31,250
You, you pay these kind of people to not answer questions in front of the,

206
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,669
like that's their job.

207
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:35,010
-- You
-- know, there's been a few. But anyways go

208
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:35,330
on,

209
00:08:35,619 --> 00:08:39,669
right. So he, he sat there and didn't answer most of the questions with a lot of words.

210
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,940
And at one point, he basically said, like it was one person's job

211
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,950
to know, this was a vulnerability and it affected us and then to tell someone else

212
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:48,869
and

213
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,989
I read that and I just thought,

214
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,859
no, it wasn't.

215
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:55,309
You are blaming some poor dude.

216
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,030
And I feel bad for whoever this person is for,

217
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:00,090
for this blame because it's clearly not them.

218
00:09:00,099 --> 00:09:00,309
But

219
00:09:00,489 --> 00:09:04,750
if you say that that it was one person's fault, the answer is, yes, it was.

220
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,510
And it was yours, right?

221
00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:06,809
I mean,

222
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,809
that's the reality

223
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:08,890
-- the
-- process.

224
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:13,869
I mean, literally if that guy ever goes on vacation or eats a bad sandwich or,

225
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,669
or just gets his,

226
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:15,150
like

227
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:15,299
a

228
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,989
factor of one is not a good thing.

229
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,510
Well, not only that, how many CD ES get assigned per day?

230
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:23,309
-- 100
-- quite a rather a lot.

231
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,309
And, and in fairness, even if this guy is just in charge of struts,

232
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,340
like he's the struts, security expert at Equifax.

233
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:32,359
No, realistically that's a possible thing because they probably have hundreds

234
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,090
of apps based on struts. Right. Like,

235
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:37,549
I mean, I know there's like, you know, large organizations out like

236
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,559
a perfect example. Right.

237
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:42,179
I know an electrician and all he does and it's not just him, it's a team of people,

238
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:44,559
they test fire alarms and replace broken ones

239
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:49,270
and it's for the local university and they have over 100 buildings.

240
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,659
So it's a full time job.

241
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:51,419
That's,

242
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,270
well, it's, it's the University of Alberta. Right. They have, like,

243
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:58,590
35 or 40,000 students on campus.

244
00:09:59,419 --> 00:10:02,419
Like, that's a lot of buildings and, like, that's obviously ii,

245
00:10:02,429 --> 00:10:04,479
I can't even imagine how many fire alarms are.

246
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,500
Not only that,

247
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:09,309
I think fire alarms are a super critical piece of their infrastructure

248
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,190
because if there is a fire and the fire alarms don't work,

249
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,250
I mean, it, it would be a tragedy.

250
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,270
Well, especially with all the labs and stuff they have.

251
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,929
I mean, there's some really horrendous chemicals on site. But anyways. Yeah.

252
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,859
So, yeah, having this, like,

253
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,460
having one guy even, and, and even if it's not

254
00:10:25,739 --> 00:10:28,260
just a one person team, like, you know,

255
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:32,530
I'm assuming it's maybe one person was responsible for making the call

256
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:34,780
and not like there's only one person that can do this and

257
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:38,179
I guess they just don't do security updates whenever he goes on vacation.

258
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,039
But let's assume for a moment they have a team and it was his call.

259
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:44,289
Somebody should backstop that or somebody there should be some sort of process to,

260
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:46,840
like, ensure, or even just a checklist.

261
00:10:46,849 --> 00:10:49,669
Like, do we run this? Yes, we're not going to fix this. Ok.

262
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:52,229
What was the rationale for not fixing this? Ok. Cool.

263
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,280
You know, or have we not made a decision about this yet? Ok.

264
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,619
This needs to be bumped up the food chain or something

265
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,070
because we haven't dealt with it in a few days.

266
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,599
You know, like,

267
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,950
like I know the way it is at Red Hat, like, if, you know,

268
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,500
a new CV comes in and I have to deal with it and I don't deal with it.

269
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:09,400
You know, at some point pretty soon somebody's like poking me with a stick and,

270
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:10,239
or my boss.

271
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,169
Well,

272
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:16,580
so that's part of the problem, but there's still kind of that incoming aspect of,

273
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,219
if you have one person paying attention to all the incoming stuff,

274
00:11:20,539 --> 00:11:23,289
you're doing it wrong. Right. First of all, it should be a robot,

275
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:25,450
but more importantly is

276
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,510
this is a job that there's going to be a lot of

277
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,979
false negatives just because of the way the security stuff works.

278
00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:32,479
There's

279
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,780
-- there's going to be false positives and there's going to be false negatives,
-- right?

280
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,679
It's not even it's that there's,

281
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:38,710
well,

282
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:40,530
you know, we have some stuff that's affected,

283
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:42,729
some stuff that's not affected and then another

284
00:11:42,739 --> 00:11:45,219
struts flaw comes in and that Venn diagram,

285
00:11:45,229 --> 00:11:46,770
there's overlap, you know what I mean?

286
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,099
Like

287
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:50,809
because if you have like 100 apps uh like a perfect example,

288
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,400
there was a really bad flaw in, in the older struts,

289
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:56,679
one remote code execution in the deserializing stuff.

290
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,140
So like remote code execution

291
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,489
and um uh

292
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:04,280
if memory serves, yeah, it was satellite version five uses it,

293
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,359
but we don't actually use that function at all

294
00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:08,340
anywhere and there's no plan to and the code is

295
00:12:08,349 --> 00:12:10,280
mature and we are never ever going to use that

296
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:12,710
function and we checked for that function and we,

297
00:12:12,719 --> 00:12:14,830
you know, blah blah, blah, blah, blah and we went, you know what?

298
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,239
Ok, we're like, we'll eventually upgrade struts one, but like,

299
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,080
not today because we're not vulnerable today.

300
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:20,239
And,

301
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,659
you know, we like really double, double, double checked everything to make sure,

302
00:12:24,669 --> 00:12:26,400
you know, we didn't have to fix it right away.

303
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,390
And that's just one thing, you know, when you have 100 of these,

304
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,549
I imagine these people, you know,

305
00:12:32,729 --> 00:12:35,630
you might either, either you have to have the discipline to do it correctly,

306
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:40,419
uh, in checking everything or to put it more bluntly. And sometimes this is better

307
00:12:40,549 --> 00:12:41,960
just upgrade across,

308
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:42,770
just upgrade,

309
00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:43,890
right?

310
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:46,510
-- Whether or not you're vulnerable,
-- just upgrade. I

311
00:12:46,619 --> 00:12:46,669
agree,

312
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,119
I think.

313
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:48,409
Well,

314
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:51,849
-- so there's also that
-- incurs cost and that requires expertise and that

315
00:12:51,859 --> 00:12:54,440
requires knowing what you have and being able to upgrade it,

316
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:54,799
which,

317
00:12:55,599 --> 00:12:58,210
you know, for all we know these things running at Equifax.

318
00:12:58,219 --> 00:12:59,859
Did Equifax have that code?

319
00:12:59,869 --> 00:13:03,669
-- Did they build that system or did they buy it off the shelf? Like,
-- I mean, we know,

320
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,460
and it,

321
00:13:05,469 --> 00:13:08,950
it doesn't matter either because if you have

322
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,760
an internet facing system that's running old stuff,

323
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,900
like it's your problem, you don't get to say, oh, we didn't buy

324
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,270
or we inherited this or this came with an,

325
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:20,679
no, it's your problem. Like that's, that's the way it is.

326
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:24,130
That's one thing I've been talking about a lot with respect to, um,

327
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,530
CV ES for software.

328
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:28,580
And also we're looking at CV S for service and one of the, the problems we have with CV.

329
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,979
S for service is, well, what can somebody do about a CV in a service? Right.

330
00:13:32,109 --> 00:13:33,229
They can't fix it because, you know,

331
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:35,820
it's a cross site scripting on their bank website or whatever.

332
00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:38,559
And my response always is like worst case scenario

333
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,719
when you have a flawed piece of software,

334
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:42,000
you can stop using it.

335
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:45,020
Right. That's, that's the ultimate

336
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,150
nuclear solution as it were.

337
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,390
Now, obviously, if you have a critical business function based on that,

338
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:55,450
well, you can't or you can't very easily stop using it, but

339
00:13:55,979 --> 00:13:59,210
there is theoretically that option is always there.

340
00:13:59,489 --> 00:14:03,500
And so, yeah, I mean, by, by using old software, especially internet facing,

341
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,010
as you said,

342
00:14:05,099 --> 00:14:09,130
you are choosing to take that risk whether you do it knowingly or not,

343
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,039
hopefully people are doing it knowingly.

344
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:15,080
I feel like quite often they are unknowingly taking it, right?

345
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,520
Because I mean, you even have good inventories of their software.

346
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,419
Well, apparently not Equifax because

347
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:20,869
you know, they, they,

348
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:21,520
yeah.

349
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,109
Well, you know, that's actually

350
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:28,820
another part of the story that that no one's focusing on very well is the fact that

351
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,659
we're picking on

352
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:33,309
eac a lot because it's really easy to do because they got caught, right?

353
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,429
They're not special.

354
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:38,510
This, this is going to be the story of nearly everyone else.

355
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:39,390
And

356
00:14:39,969 --> 00:14:43,460
there isn't a good answer today because all of our

357
00:14:43,469 --> 00:14:47,960
systems are cobbled together based upon 30 year old principles.

358
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:49,150
And they just,

359
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,229
they don't exist in a state that we can easily secure them.

360
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:56,109
And anyone sitting there thinking, oh, but my network secure. No, it's not.

361
00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:57,229
-- You, you might think it
-- is

362
00:14:57,739 --> 00:14:57,989
wrong

363
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:00,989
that we have inherited and created now.

364
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:01,799
You know,

365
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:06,549
great example is like bash shell shock that vulnerable code was put in in 1995.

366
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,809
I, I bet

367
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:11,559
-- 20 years later a lot of
-- people weren't even alive

368
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:13,770
when that was done. Right. It's,

369
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:14,929
yes.

370
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,179
You know,

371
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,280
some of these fundamental assumptions we made about

372
00:15:17,289 --> 00:15:19,200
memory management that came up with the whole stack

373
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,580
guard thing a few months ago.

374
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:26,390
I mean, my favorite was, people were like, oh, you know, this the stack guard stuff,

375
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,780
blah, blah, blah, that will protect us.

376
00:15:27,789 --> 00:15:27,960
And,

377
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,789
you know, the Devs looked into it and they're like, well, hm, well,

378
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,219
it's based on assumptions that are 20

379
00:15:32,229 --> 00:15:34,309
years old and a different programming language.

380
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,710
They don't work anymore as it turns out,

381
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,469
you know, the world changed.

382
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,150
Speaking of getting caught so well.

383
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:44,239
And this is one thing I just got another email from,

384
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:46,849
um, have I been ped? Apparently Kickstarter got

385
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:50,869
-- owned about, what was it in 2004?
-- Everybody's been POed and,

386
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,969
and I'm waiting for, have I been ped to be poed?

387
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,710
Because that's gonna be when it all goes full circle?

388
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:01,369
Yeah. So, anyways, um, but I'm curious, have you been PED

389
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:02,059
yet?

390
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:04,969
-- You know, because
-- I'm listed in, I think five or six.

391
00:16:04,979 --> 00:16:08,000
Now, I do not look because I feel like

392
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,260
don't do that,

393
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,039
but I feel like typing my, my information

394
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:13,510
for your personal email address.

395
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,330
Thanks, Bud.

396
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,539
-- I'm just gonna sign you up because really no, the email alerts are
-- nice but no,

397
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:19,960
you don't, don't

398
00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:20,530
get

399
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:20,890
a

400
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:26,059
-- confirmation email to sign up. Tell me what
-- signing up means in this context.

401
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:30,880
So. Ok. Have I been pwned is a lovely website where basically this guy

402
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:33,669
Troy Hunt, uh, he's got a,

403
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:37,299
he's actually got one of those fancy SSL certificates with like his name in it,

404
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:39,020
which apparently was a nightmare to get for him.

405
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,760
But anyways,

406
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:42,260
he runs a website called, have I been

407
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:43,369
pwned.com

408
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:44,549
by the

409
00:16:44,659 --> 00:16:44,679
way?

410
00:16:45,729 --> 00:16:48,780
And well, yeah, and the answer if you have an email address, the answer is yes.

411
00:16:49,469 --> 00:16:49,919
Um,

412
00:16:50,539 --> 00:16:54,840
and basically what he does is he collects sort of public dumps of

413
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:58,960
Pwned information. So, like the Yahoo dump or whatever,

414
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,630
he dumps them into his system.

415
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,619
And so it's, it's sometimes it's just emails,

416
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:05,439
sometimes it's emails and hashed passwords, sometimes it's whatever,

417
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:06,260
more information.

418
00:17:07,088 --> 00:17:08,468
And he basically,

419
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:12,078
uh, we'll let you search by email address

420
00:17:12,308 --> 00:17:14,148
to see if somebody's been pulled because let's face it right.

421
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:16,188
If you really wanna find this stuff, you can go find it.

422
00:17:16,198 --> 00:17:19,448
It's, it's in the Google, it's in the very search engine. So it's not like this is,

423
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:21,848
you know, really secret information. This stuff is

424
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:24,769
not quite public, public but it's, it's out there if you look.

425
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,128
And um,

426
00:17:26,138 --> 00:17:28,458
one of the nice things about his site is you can register your

427
00:17:28,468 --> 00:17:31,769
email address so that you get a notification when he gets a dump.

428
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:33,140
So for example,

429
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:37,410
I just got an email from him a few hours ago saying you are one of 5 million,

430
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:41,469
176,463 people ped in the Kickstarter data breach.

431
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,880
The breach was Kickstarter. Date of breach was 16th of February 2014.

432
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:50,150
Uh The compromised data was email addresses and the hashed passwords.

433
00:17:50,489 --> 00:17:51,339
So the nice thing,

434
00:17:51,349 --> 00:17:55,699
for example is if I had reused my password at Kickstarter somewhere else,

435
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:57,569
I would know now that I have to change it.

436
00:17:57,579 --> 00:18:00,630
-- Although this is why I use a password manager
-- and

437
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,910
yes, please use a password manager of people.

438
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:03,670
Yeah.

439
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,510
Well,

440
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,189
the thing about the password manager for me is it's less about password management

441
00:18:08,939 --> 00:18:09,310
in

442
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:14,300
like, well, it's more about having it generate a unique password per site and

443
00:18:14,449 --> 00:18:16,560
syncing them between all my devices and web browsers.

444
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:19,390
And basically all the things I have to log into websites on.

445
00:18:20,469 --> 00:18:24,489
But you see most people sync it by just using the same password everywhere.

446
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,119
-- So they only have
-- to remember, you have to remember your password.

447
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,199
And so with the password manager,

448
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:33,439
I have a really good password on my password manager. And then I literally,

449
00:18:33,709 --> 00:18:36,510
I don't know my passwords for all my websites because I

450
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,709
had them generated automatically and I never looked at them.

451
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,439
But what you're doing is what everyone else does.

452
00:18:41,449 --> 00:18:43,359
It's just they type that password into each

453
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:45,479
site instead of to their password manager.

454
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:48,859
Uh, actually, you know, I've been doing this for a long time and I do have,

455
00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:52,900
my concern is reusing passwords and the reason it came up is I remember,

456
00:18:53,489 --> 00:18:54,859
oh, man, this was,

457
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,680
this has been a long time now, but it was, do you remember the vendor

458
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,849
se mailing list

459
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,689
from like a million years ago? I remember

460
00:19:03,099 --> 00:19:03,729
the the vendor

461
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:06,609
se admin send me, sends me an email one day and says, hey,

462
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:09,010
someone's trying to log in as you with this password.

463
00:19:09,829 --> 00:19:14,430
And I looked and it was my, it was my full disclosure password for, for the mail man.

464
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:16,449
And like I, at that time I'd been using

465
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:19,869
just like randomly generated passwords and I throw them in a text file for,

466
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,020
for mailing lists.

467
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,040
And I thought, wow, that's like the real deal.

468
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:23,310
You know,

469
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:27,170
I need to get way more serious about using a password manager because there were,

470
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,189
I had a couple of sites.

471
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:29,219
I basically had

472
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:33,420
like a couple tiers of passwords. Where, where I had my, my lame,

473
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,449
I don't care about this website password. I would just reuse.

474
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:40,109
And, and after that happened, I thought like, yeah, this is, this is not cool.

475
00:19:40,619 --> 00:19:40,900
Yeah.

476
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,560
No, I know people that do that they have like, their high security password for,

477
00:19:43,569 --> 00:19:45,189
like their online banking and the government.

478
00:19:45,199 --> 00:19:48,410
Then they have like, their medium security password for like Amazon and whatnot.

479
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,859
And then they have like, their low security password for, like,

480
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:51,920
the,

481
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:55,430
I have a spreadsheet with over 1000 entries

482
00:19:56,469 --> 00:19:57,630
for all the websites,

483
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,010
spreadsheet

484
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,540
and passwords. Uh, well, that's the low severity stuff.

485
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,020
The high,

486
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,229
higher severity stuff is in last pass now

487
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:07,880
and I'm slowly moving everything into last pass,

488
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:08,989
you know.

489
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,219
Um, but the problem is like, you know, manually managing all this,

490
00:20:12,229 --> 00:20:13,780
I'd have to sit down for 10 hours

491
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,829
-- and I'm just not going
-- to last pass. Can import CS V or something, can't it?

492
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:22,030
Yeah. That would mean having like the URL S and stuff.

493
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,800
I have, like, I have a note like, you know,

494
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:26,800
like a site name or sort of a site name followed by like,

495
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:30,420
maybe an account name or maybe not because typically I use like Kurt or

496
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:33,069
Fried or Casey Fried or, you know, whatever. Right.

497
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,839
So I can usually guess my user name or more ideally,

498
00:20:35,849 --> 00:20:38,229
they're not jerks that way and they're like, what's your email address?

499
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:38,800
Because

500
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,939
an email address, you know, let's face it.

501
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:43,400
Email address is a heck of a lot better identifier.

502
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,130
In

503
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,760
fact, I get annoyed now, insight to make me think of a user name.

504
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:48,400
Yeah.

505
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:52,189
Well, and it's like I, well, when I registered to get my Nexus card, I

506
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:53,349
uh,

507
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,420
you enter a user name and it, like, checks if it's available obviously. And it,

508
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,760
I did that in like one tab and then I think

509
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:02,079
I accidentally opened up a second tab and then it wouldn't,

510
00:21:02,089 --> 00:21:04,469
and I closed the first tab and then it wouldn't let me

511
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:07,270
anyways, I ended up with Curtsey Fried Two for my, like,

512
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,689
us government website user name because it, I accidentally somehow reserved.

513
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,000
So annoying. That's awesome.

514
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,040
Yeah. But, uh, anyways, yeah.

515
00:21:16,189 --> 00:21:16,780
So

516
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,010
with, have I been

517
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,959
ped, I mean, the reality is, yes, you have been and

518
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,420
I, I think it's, well, for me it's

519
00:21:23,729 --> 00:21:26,540
less about, like, I'm not worried about pastor reuse because I have, you know,

520
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,910
last past or whatever, generating them randomly now.

521
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,060
Um,

522
00:21:30,709 --> 00:21:34,420
and, yeah, I mean, it's, you, you have to use that, especially because, like,

523
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:38,599
I'm logging into stuff from my phone, my tablet, my laptop, my other laptop, my,

524
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,199
you know, desktop

525
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,410
and, and synchronizing all that stuff is, is a nightmare.

526
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:43,739
But, you know,

527
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,890
having last pass as a service where it just

528
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,949
dumps it all into their thing and it's encrypted.

529
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:49,719
I hope,

530
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,500
uh, you know. Cool.

531
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:52,520
Right.

532
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:55,670
Yeah. So I, I have an email here from, have I been

533
00:21:55,869 --> 00:21:58,390
pot? I have to click a button to confirm. I'm a person

534
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,839
but I do love the beginning of it says you or possibly someone else have signed up

535
00:22:03,229 --> 00:22:03,300
or

536
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:04,239
have I been p,

537
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:08,550
I mean, there's something in me that just says don't do this.

538
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,760
But, but another part of me wants to click that button.

539
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:11,780
So I don't know.

540
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,469
-- I'm gonna think
-- about you get an email about once every six months saying, you know,

541
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:16,819
some old data breach happened and you were in it and,

542
00:22:16,829 --> 00:22:20,910
and I guess that's part of it is I'm using unique passwords literally everywhere

543
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:25,069
and my email address is not a secret. So I'm not even a little concerned about that.

544
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,949
So, yeah, I don't know. I don't know, man,

545
00:22:28,199 --> 00:22:31,859
the reality is the bad guys have these password dumps and stuff, you know?

546
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:32,420
Right.

547
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:34,069
And they have enorm.

548
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:35,910
Well, it depends who the bad guy is,

549
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,589
but many of them have enormous resources

550
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:40,589
for cracking passwords and things like that.

551
00:22:40,689 --> 00:22:41,410
And, well,

552
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,949
more to the point there's those password list

553
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:45,040
now of all the publicly called passwords.

554
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:47,089
Right? I mean, there's been articles about that where,

555
00:22:47,459 --> 00:22:49,520
you know, what people thought were good passwords.

556
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,829
I mean, they were good passwords until some

557
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:55,060
jack off running a website stored them in plain text. And

558
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,910
there are basically no good passwords anymore.

559
00:22:58,089 --> 00:23:01,579
More to the point. That's the problem with, even if you choose a secure password,

560
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,780
how do you know the website you're typing it into is going to store it securely.

561
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:08,939
Uh, you have to assume they won't, which is why you can't reuse passwords.

562
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:11,910
But then the thing I'm still wondering is

563
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:15,920
so the passwords I use for things like my password manager

564
00:23:16,339 --> 00:23:20,319
are obscenely long, like obscenely long.

565
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:24,099
But I also wonder how hard it would be for

566
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,140
someone with,

567
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:29,300
we'll say significant resources to actually tear through that password.

568
00:23:29,469 --> 00:23:31,260
-- And,
-- well, it's a question of entropy. Right.

569
00:23:31,969 --> 00:23:35,369
Well, and that's just it. Right. Anyone who has a really, really long password,

570
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:37,660
it's probably mostly English words,

571
00:23:38,069 --> 00:23:38,569
you know,

572
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:41,569
and, and that really limits the,

573
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:45,250
the number of bits you have of randomness in your password.

574
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,189
Yes and no, it depends on how you choose the words.

575
00:23:47,199 --> 00:23:51,250
If you choose the words randomly, then you would have two to the power of whatever,

576
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:51,530
right?

577
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,930
Like you have X number of words in the

578
00:23:52,939 --> 00:23:55,500
English language and you pick battery horse staple.

579
00:23:55,569 --> 00:23:56,719
Who's a bad example because X

580
00:23:56,949 --> 00:23:57,270
CD

581
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,920
that battery horse staple card.

582
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,109
Oh, sorry, correct. Battery horse.

583
00:24:01,349 --> 00:24:05,439
So, you know, if you choose a pass a passage from Shakespeare, for example,

584
00:24:05,709 --> 00:24:08,400
you know, that is uh maybe not a good idea.

585
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:11,380
But if you have something randomly pick, you know,

586
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,469
eight words out of the entire English corpus,

587
00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:15,479
um

588
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,689
This is

589
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:20,709
I, I need to do some math on this at some point. But, but the thing is,

590
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:24,859
are, are eight random words from, from, let's say something like dia

591
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:30,410
are eight random words more secure than a 30 plus word.

592
00:24:31,209 --> 00:24:34,469
A bit of text out of say Shakespeare. Like because he brought it up.

593
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,920
Well, it, it kind of depends on who's cracking that password. And let's face it.

594
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,069
They're not gonna try

595
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,680
tons of random stuff. They're gonna, like, run a

596
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,119
pa,

597
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:48,500
here's the thing, this is the, the law of, uh, industrial drag net fishing. Right.

598
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,550
I,

599
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:54,270
it, unless it's a targeted attack, I'm just, I'm happy to crack 10% of the accounts.

600
00:24:54,329 --> 00:24:57,750
So I'm going to use the word lists and the password lists that are out there

601
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,479
and I'm going to get 10 or 20% of all the accounts.

602
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:05,020
-- Ok.
-- So if, if you're doing like a blanket kind of cracking,

603
00:25:05,489 --> 00:25:07,430
-- then
-- which is what they're mostly doing.

604
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,770
They're not, why would they target somebody

605
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:09,430
when they can,

606
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,260
who your audience is? Right? Like

607
00:25:13,709 --> 00:25:16,270
if you're targeting a specific person,

608
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:17,989
then

609
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:21,479
that, that's kind of the, the vision I have because let's face it.

610
00:25:21,489 --> 00:25:24,300
If you're just doing random cracking on a password file,

611
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,400
you're gonna get more than half the passwords

612
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:28,750
being like eight characters or less and crap.

613
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,819
I mean, that's a given,

614
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:31,459
but I'm more thinking

615
00:25:31,689 --> 00:25:33,599
my obscenely long password.

616
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,880
Am I better off with

617
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:40,359
an obscenely long password that is made up of actual English words I can remember?

618
00:25:40,369 --> 00:25:42,680
Or am I better off with eight words that

619
00:25:42,689 --> 00:25:45,160
I will struggle to remember but are more random

620
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,260
and I don't know the answer to that.

621
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,949
Well, it depends if you truly. So there's 100 and what is this?

622
00:25:51,979 --> 00:25:54,829
100 and 71,476 words in the English?

623
00:25:54,989 --> 00:25:56,670
-- Yeah,
-- I know. Like 50 of them. Ok.

624
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,290
So,

625
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:57,810
I

626
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,229
mean,

627
00:25:58,810 --> 00:25:59,550
well, exactly.

628
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,469
And I was just gonna say we can immediately eliminate like a good,

629
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:03,280
there's about what,

630
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:07,199
there's basically about what 10,000 words most people use on a regular basis,

631
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:12,520
-- you know. You know,
-- you even made me think now is you and I write and talk a lot.

632
00:26:12,719 --> 00:26:15,199
And so if someone was really looking to target us,

633
00:26:15,209 --> 00:26:19,030
they could go through all of our recordings and all of our writings and probably get

634
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,510
80 plus percent of our vocabulary.

635
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,280
I mean, so that's the thing, right?

636
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:27,469
For this to be secure, you'd have to have a computer pick at random these words

637
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:31,180
and then you'd end up with stupid words like medical terms or, you know,

638
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:33,040
oh my favorite word successfully.

639
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,359
I hate spelling the word.

640
00:26:34,739 --> 00:26:39,689
Um because I actually do use it once in a while and I'm like frigging still red tap,

641
00:26:39,699 --> 00:26:40,869
tap, tap, still red tap.

642
00:26:40,939 --> 00:26:44,160
Oh, there we go. You right. Click it, man. And it gives you the suggestions.

643
00:26:44,329 --> 00:26:46,550
-- No,
-- because usually I mangle it enough that it can.

644
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,239
So actually, you know what you say that?

645
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,449
And I don't know what's wrong with me lately,

646
00:26:51,459 --> 00:26:55,770
but I feel like the Chrome dictionary has become unable to guess the word, I mean,

647
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,810
and I feel like it used to be much better at it.

648
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,290
Oh, I agree completely.

649
00:26:59,459 --> 00:27:02,530
So, uh Google Chrome devs like get on that. Right?

650
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,729
Or it's not Google Chrome that's broken. It's you and I are getting older.

651
00:27:05,739 --> 00:27:09,640
Uh, well, I am getting older but my expectations, I guess, like,

652
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:11,290
they have a huge A I system.

653
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:12,719
Right. Like, come on, get with it.

654
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:13,689
Yeah.

655
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:16,560
So I think as far as a targeted attack goes,

656
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:18,780
are you better off with eight random words?

657
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:18,949
Now,

658
00:27:18,959 --> 00:27:24,010
if they are truly eight random words out of the corpus of 171,000 and change words,

659
00:27:24,489 --> 00:27:28,119
clearly, statistically that that's a big number. I just plugged it into Excel and

660
00:27:28,619 --> 00:27:29,319
there's a lot of

661
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:30,449
like,

662
00:27:30,569 --> 00:27:31,760
what's wrong with you

663
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,520
because, uh,

664
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:35,250
I don't know where the calculator is in

665
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,880
Mac Os without going hunting through that stupid

666
00:27:38,209 --> 00:27:39,469
little jet.

667
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,250
-- What is it? That little icon look like?
-- I don't know, I

668
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:45,170
-- know what
-- the little launch pad thing. Right. And then I got to flip it over to.

669
00:27:45,489 --> 00:27:45,699
That's

670
00:27:45,949 --> 00:27:49,109
right. They don't have a real calculator on Os X anymore, do they?

671
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:49,500
It's,

672
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:50,814
you just have to go find an

673
00:27:51,214 --> 00:27:52,224
-- idiot
-- place. I

674
00:27:52,334 --> 00:27:53,494
mean, I know it's somewhere

675
00:27:54,744 --> 00:27:57,405
they're not in alphabetical order. Oh, there we go. Found calculator. Ok.

676
00:27:57,415 --> 00:27:59,354
There's a calculator. And then I got to like, go

677
00:27:59,505 --> 00:28:01,094
-- file no edit.
-- No,

678
00:28:01,244 --> 00:28:01,564
you

679
00:28:01,755 --> 00:28:02,104
wasting your

680
00:28:02,295 --> 00:28:02,324
time.

681
00:28:02,864 --> 00:28:04,295
Scientific. There we go.

682
00:28:04,535 --> 00:28:05,385
Anyways.

683
00:28:05,395 --> 00:28:05,484
Um,

684
00:28:05,494 --> 00:28:07,314
I just like Excel because it's also easier to

685
00:28:07,324 --> 00:28:09,295
manipulate the numbers and do the what if scenarios.

686
00:28:09,305 --> 00:28:10,265
But anyways, actually,

687
00:28:10,275 --> 00:28:12,255
I guess that should have been 171 factorial

688
00:28:12,265 --> 00:28:14,574
eight because you probably shouldn't reuse the words.

689
00:28:14,584 --> 00:28:15,295
But, um,

690
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:15,900
yeah,

691
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:18,160
the reality is most people are gonna probably

692
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:20,670
pick from a corpus of about 10,000 words.

693
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:22,699
Most of which are kind of,

694
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:25,449
well, the same for everybody really.

695
00:28:25,709 --> 00:28:28,329
And so if it's a targeted attack and I have the hash,

696
00:28:28,579 --> 00:28:30,780
yeah, I'm gonna win, it's gonna take an hour,

697
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,619
but I'm gonna win. Right.

698
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,089
Right.

699
00:28:34,229 --> 00:28:34,880
Maybe.

700
00:28:35,219 --> 00:28:36,719
So, that's why I have last pass.

701
00:28:36,729 --> 00:28:39,089
And I hope to God, those random passwords are truly random.

702
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,609
They claim to be and they look,

703
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:41,930
they look random to me,

704
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:42,489
-- you
-- know.

705
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,890
So actually on that note,

706
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,229
even I'm less concerned with somebody cracking my password

707
00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:50,449
on a website as I am of password reuse

708
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:54,449
where my assumption is if somebody gets the password dictionary from somewhere,

709
00:28:54,459 --> 00:28:57,479
like they, they're going to crack it all and they can have my password,

710
00:28:57,489 --> 00:29:00,520
I guess at that point, if you have that level of access, you don't need my password.

711
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,010
Right.

712
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,359
My concern is just making sure that that password doesn't exist anywhere else.

713
00:29:05,699 --> 00:29:07,449
So once they have it,

714
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,650
they can't break into my email or whatever.

715
00:29:10,939 --> 00:29:14,119
Yeah. Well, and that's why I'm very well to put a blank. That's why

716
00:29:14,489 --> 00:29:17,670
two factor authentication, especially on stuff. Like your email

717
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,930
really needs to be a thing for everybody because like your email,

718
00:29:20,939 --> 00:29:22,170
if I have access to your email,

719
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:23,349
I can just go password,

720
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:26,119
reset all the things because they're just gonna send an email.

721
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,550
They're not gonna ask a secret question or anything stupid like that.

722
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,709
And chances are, if there is a secret question,

723
00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:33,550
I'll just be able to strip mine your email for the answer to it.

724
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,390
Exactly.

725
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:37,390
Unless you're a doofus like me and you have a whole bunch

726
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,910
of random answers to those things that are kept in a spreadsheet.

727
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,859
But yeah, so, I mean, this is really why,

728
00:29:41,869 --> 00:29:46,400
especially on things like lastpass or on Gmail or whatever your email account is,

729
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,819
you really need to use two factor authentication and, you know.

730
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,140
Yeah, that's, well, and also things like your, say, your, your DNS,

731
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,400
if you run your own DNS,

732
00:29:54,579 --> 00:29:57,250
you know, if I hijack your DNS, I can read all your email, right?

733
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,410
Because I can redirect it,

734
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,989
you know, or there was that case of that 911 system that relied, uh,

735
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,410
the domain name for part of the system expired and it broke the 911 system for

736
00:30:07,709 --> 00:30:10,040
the deaf and what not for three days,

737
00:30:10,949 --> 00:30:11,439
you know,

738
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:15,089
and it took them a while to figure out, right? Because why is the system not working?

739
00:30:15,099 --> 00:30:17,089
-- You know, you'd be getting weird error codes.
-- And

740
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:18,000
I

741
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:19,329
guess kind of

742
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:22,430
this conversation also leads us to the fact that

743
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:25,750
now Yahoo is saying 3 billion passwords were hacked,

744
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,790
not 1 billion.

745
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,699
So

746
00:30:27,949 --> 00:30:31,569
I guess Equifax is getting too close to a billion for their liking or something.

747
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,949
And they, they had up the ante,

748
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:36,650
it's, I mean, and that's the thing. Right, at that point,

749
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,130
I think it's safe to say

750
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:41,650
that basically every password has been leaked.

751
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,609
-- Well, every password that's ever been used and stored somewhere,
-- I mean, yeah,

752
00:30:45,619 --> 00:30:46,339
3 billion.

753
00:30:46,349 --> 00:30:46,739
It's,

754
00:30:47,699 --> 00:30:50,290
well, you know what I wonder though? Ok, so 3 billion accounts,

755
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:55,479
I wonder how much overlap there is with the passwords. I, I bet there are

756
00:30:55,699 --> 00:30:57,859
probably 2 billion or less.

757
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:03,390
There was that one site that did that, like the top, well, no top passwords in use.

758
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,430
And it was like

759
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:13,000
uh 65432155555553 RJ S one L A seven, QE Google

760
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,900
one QTW three E four R

761
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,380
oh, they're just alternating like

762
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:22,099
one, Q two, W three E four R five T.

763
00:31:22,109 --> 00:31:25,010
Well, it's easy to type and it looks random to an eight or a monkey. Right.

764
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:25,800
Right.

765
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:28,989
The world's most common passwords revealed and, you know, well, it reminds me,

766
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,500
did you ever see that a guy did a really beautiful heat diagram of pin numbers?

767
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,260
And what he did is he, instead of plotting it out,

768
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:39,000
he did the uh the X axis as two numbers and the Y axis is two numbers.

769
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:42,410
So like, you know, 00 through 99 and 00 through 99.

770
00:31:43,219 --> 00:31:45,959
And so there's like this nice little strip of the diagonal

771
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:48,689
with like 11111, you know,

772
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:52,079
1211, you know, and, and these heat maps.

773
00:31:52,449 --> 00:31:57,219
And what I find so funny is like, um, when I typed in like, 1234 on my iphone,

774
00:31:57,229 --> 00:31:58,920
it was like, oh, that's a bad four digit pin.

775
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,319
You shouldn't use it. Which is true.

776
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:03,880
But it's just as bad as any other four digit pin. Really?

777
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:04,410
Uh, it,

778
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:10,000
it is not as bad because the 10 fingered monkey who might find

779
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:13,709
your iphone is probably going to try that one because it's not random.

780
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:16,920
Well, it's not random to us. It's, it's random.

781
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:21,199
But this is one of those things that I I find so interesting

782
00:32:21,449 --> 00:32:22,109
is

783
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,079
once you start applying things like artificial intelligence

784
00:32:25,089 --> 00:32:28,119
and machine learning and just data processing in general

785
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:28,869
to

786
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,760
things humans do.

787
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,800
We are incredibly predictable creatures.

788
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:37,819
I mean, we think we're super random or we think our past would be greater.

789
00:32:37,829 --> 00:32:40,239
We think that that secret question or whatever,

790
00:32:40,329 --> 00:32:43,290
but the reality is we're not and you actually said something a few minutes ago

791
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,979
that's super relevant about strip mining your email

792
00:32:45,989 --> 00:32:48,040
for the answer to your secret questions is

793
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:54,160
my suspicion is if you fed someone's corpus of email or writings or anything through

794
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:57,060
some sort of machine algorithm,

795
00:32:57,699 --> 00:33:00,640
it could calculate things like passwords and

796
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:03,760
answers to secret questions with an amazing degree

797
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:07,849
-- of success just because we are super predictable creatures.
-- Yeah.

798
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:09,959
Yeah.

799
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,989
Speaking of which I still need to re

800
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,270
one of the door locks here.

801
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:14,349
So

802
00:33:14,609 --> 00:33:14,619
I

803
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:15,089
guess

804
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,410
you need to Rekey

805
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,199
a door.

806
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:18,229
Yeah.

807
00:33:18,239 --> 00:33:21,949
So my house, my new house has there's four doors with locks,

808
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:24,709
three of them are exterior, one of them is from interior,

809
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:26,160
from the garage to the house.

810
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,729
So two of the ex

811
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,250
basically, all the doors that lead into the house have been re keyed.

812
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:36,130
It's just the door on the garage that goes to the exterior has not been re keyed,

813
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,130
but it's got like a giant bar on the inside

814
00:33:39,329 --> 00:33:41,290
and we don't use that door. Right. So

815
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,420
it's just one of those things where, you know, I,

816
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:46,449
I literally forgot we had that door when I was buying locks at Home Depot.

817
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:46,839
I

818
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,819
-- see.
-- And then I get home

819
00:33:47,979 --> 00:33:52,290
-- and I'm like,
-- did you buy those crazy locks that you can kind of just make, they,

820
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,680
they work with like any key?

821
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,380
Yeah, you stick the pin in

822
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,410
or what is it? You turn it a quarter, stick the pin in, turn it back,

823
00:33:59,609 --> 00:34:00,459
stick the new key in.

824
00:34:00,569 --> 00:34:00,689
Yeah,

825
00:34:01,979 --> 00:34:02,530
I forget Schlager

826
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:03,290
Kaiser,

827
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:03,530
who

828
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,030
the instant re key?

829
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:05,319
And

830
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:06,459
it's lovely.

831
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:06,770
Well,

832
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,918
and I guess there's also the fact that basically

833
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:12,969
every lock we buy as consumers can be broken

834
00:34:13,175 --> 00:34:13,195
the

835
00:34:13,725 --> 00:34:14,165
key,

836
00:34:15,185 --> 00:34:17,645
you know, looking at the security rating on these things they have. What is it?

837
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:21,705
The three security ratings? 12 and three and one is like essentially a closet door,

838
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:21,975
right?

839
00:34:22,274 --> 00:34:26,074
You know, uh, number two is like a standard door and, and the biggest thing is,

840
00:34:26,293 --> 00:34:30,885
uh, if you look at the housing for the dead bolts on the, on the and whatever it is,

841
00:34:30,895 --> 00:34:32,155
I think it's ANSI something

842
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:36,350
on the standard two. The deadbolt exterior is two pieces.

843
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,409
There's like the collar and then there's the piece in the middle,

844
00:34:38,418 --> 00:34:40,179
which means you can very easily punch it out

845
00:34:40,188 --> 00:34:42,250
if you have like an eight pound sledge hammer and

846
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:43,770
like a concrete chisel

847
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:48,429
on the level two, that exterior piece is one piece of metal.

848
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,050
So punching it out, you're just gonna mangle the, you're just gonna mangle it.

849
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,649
Right. You can't punch it through the hole

850
00:34:54,379 --> 00:34:57,429
and that's really the only difference in security rating is one,

851
00:34:57,439 --> 00:34:58,899
you can punch the lock through

852
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,699
and then open the door

853
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:01,919
on the rating two.

854
00:35:01,929 --> 00:35:06,510
You're better off just using a halligan tool to, to pop the door or, you know,

855
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,419
using like a, a

856
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:10,669
tire jack to spread the door frame or, you know, whatever

857
00:35:10,939 --> 00:35:13,860
I would. I think the vast majority of residential

858
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,780
-- anything. I bet you could just boot the
-- door on

859
00:35:16,969 --> 00:35:16,979
a

860
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:21,409
-- good kick and it, it's going down.
-- That's what the paramedics do.

861
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,250
Right. Right.

862
00:35:22,429 --> 00:35:22,770
And

863
00:35:22,939 --> 00:35:25,929
you know, but at the same time that, that's kind of ok. And that's,

864
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:27,139
this is,

865
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,530
I don't know if we can relate this to information security. I'm thinking about it.

866
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:30,909
You can,

867
00:35:30,919 --> 00:35:32,760
because here's fundamentally what happens with home

868
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:34,570
security is unless you have some sort

869
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:39,050
of system that calls people who show up and then ultimately somebody with guns,

870
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,000
the police show up.

871
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:43,110
It doesn't matter because if you can have all the security in the world you want.

872
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,969
But if I can just sit there for a weekend and chisel away at it,

873
00:35:46,489 --> 00:35:50,870
well, not even, not even a weekend is the fact that the vast majority of,

874
00:35:50,879 --> 00:35:54,110
not even an hour, like, less than one minute

875
00:35:54,399 --> 00:35:56,850
will get you into the vast majority of homework.

876
00:35:56,889 --> 00:35:59,300
I mean, and then they're spending an hour rifling around your place,

877
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,179
going through your drawers.

878
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:00,760
All the good

879
00:36:00,899 --> 00:36:01,459
stuff. That's fair.

880
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,340
But I guess at the same time I'm thinking,

881
00:36:04,669 --> 00:36:09,139
and basically anyone with intent can break into either of our homes yet.

882
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,620
It hasn't happened.

883
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,750
And so it, it, it does to many people, right,

884
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,139
many people have their homes broken into and it's,

885
00:36:17,149 --> 00:36:18,860
it's horrible and terrible and everything.

886
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:19,239
But

887
00:36:19,389 --> 00:36:19,419
at

888
00:36:19,689 --> 00:36:21,340
the same time, like,

889
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:24,469
there's, there's not a lot you can do about it. Right.

890
00:36:24,939 --> 00:36:25,540
So we're,

891
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:29,280
we're getting a security system and here's the beauty ad

892
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:32,020
t wants 34 bucks a month to monitor it.

893
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,810
Like, holy cow. That's,

894
00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:36,250
you know, that adds up. Right.

895
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,629
So my plan is essentially to have, um,

896
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:41,120
I want a doorbell camera mostly because I live in a big

897
00:36:41,129 --> 00:36:43,360
house now and to actually get to the door like I can't,

898
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:46,239
my old house was so tiny you could basically see the front door from everywhere.

899
00:36:46,979 --> 00:36:49,449
Um, so I want to get a doorbell camera and, you know,

900
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:51,659
have like a security camera to like, essentially.

901
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,330
So when the guy drops off the package and then somebody else steals it,

902
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,360
I'll have a record of that.

903
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:56,120
Right.

904
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,100
That's always nice.

905
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,889
I love those videos, like where, you know,

906
00:36:58,899 --> 00:37:01,399
people show the video of their packages getting stolen.

907
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,899
Um,

908
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,379
and number two is get one of those like

909
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,899
smart home security systems that then will like,

910
00:37:07,909 --> 00:37:10,699
poke my, you know, basically tell my phone that, hey, you know,

911
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,580
somebody just kicked the door in or whatever, right?

912
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:16,820
And then I can go on like one of the internal cameras or something.

913
00:37:17,129 --> 00:37:19,840
Uh Well, I won't have internal cameras but, you know, I can basically, like, if I'm,

914
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:22,080
if I'm at home, I can be like, wait, why is the door open?

915
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:25,340
And if I'm not at home, I can like, maybe call the cops and be like, hey, my,

916
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:27,419
my house just called me and it says there's a problem,

917
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:28,449
right?

918
00:37:28,459 --> 00:37:31,929
And that's, there's videos of that hat like that lady and I think it was Florida

919
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,800
where she's like on the phone with 911 and she's like, there's guys in my house,

920
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:34,949
right?

921
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:36,320
And the dispatcher is like, are you safe?

922
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:39,229
And she's like, no, it's fine, I'm at work but, you know,

923
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:39,830
in

924
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:40,120
a

925
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,629
few years ago and it was,

926
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,989
it was pretty cool because then you see the cops come in and catch the guy.

927
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:47,030
That's an interesting angle actually because thinking about it.

928
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:51,219
You're gonna pay someone like ad t let's say 30 bucks a month

929
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,300
and, and

930
00:37:52,429 --> 00:37:55,629
all they do is they phone my house and they're like, are you home? No? Ok.

931
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:56,580
Somebody broke into your house.

932
00:37:56,590 --> 00:38:00,739
It's like insurance, right where they're counting on nothing happening.

933
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,459
And that's why they do that

934
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,260
and,

935
00:38:03,689 --> 00:38:05,010
and, and let's face it as well.

936
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,739
The odds of something happening are probably very low.

937
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,639
Even when I lived in a crappier neighborhood.

938
00:38:10,649 --> 00:38:10,989
Uh,

939
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,570
the only time we had cops show up is when I accidentally hit

940
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,139
the panic button on my key fob at like one in the morning,

941
00:38:16,149 --> 00:38:18,219
I was out in the garage working building shelves.

942
00:38:18,389 --> 00:38:20,439
And so all of a sudden there's people with, you know,

943
00:38:20,449 --> 00:38:24,550
flashlights in my backyard and I'm like, I realize that they have guns and they're,

944
00:38:24,919 --> 00:38:26,570
you know, a bit grumpy looking,

945
00:38:27,689 --> 00:38:28,649
you know. But, uh, and

946
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:29,340
I,

947
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:30,889
and it had the right address.

948
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:34,909
Well, I was, I was, I was using a skill saw in the garage. Right.

949
00:38:34,919 --> 00:38:37,550
So I didn't hear anything until I saw flashlights in my back,

950
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:38,189
you know.

951
00:38:38,459 --> 00:38:41,909
Um, so, yeah, the only time basically it worked is a, was a false positive.

952
00:38:42,139 --> 00:38:46,050
-- Right.
-- Right. And that's kind of my thought here is I would say

953
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,889
trying to do this yourself is kind of crazy.

954
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:53,270
But at the same time, my suspicion is this is a rare enough event

955
00:38:53,459 --> 00:38:56,110
that you can easily justify doing it yourself.

956
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,469
-- Well,
-- a perfect example is the n smoke alarms I have. Right.

957
00:38:58,479 --> 00:39:01,350
The only time I get alerts from them is when one of us, you know,

958
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,149
accidentally sets the heat too high and burns the butter in the pan.

959
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:07,669
-- So,
-- did you bring those things to your new house too?

960
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:10,909
Yeah. But I also have like regular smoke alarms.

961
00:39:10,919 --> 00:39:11,370
So now you have,

962
00:39:11,379 --> 00:39:13,889
which are actually quite lovely now because in Canada they're bilingual.

963
00:39:13,899 --> 00:39:14,649
So when you hit the test,

964
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,419
it's like testing carbon monoxide,

965
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,360
you know, blah, blah, blah monoxide,

966
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:19,050
Dan,

967
00:39:19,689 --> 00:39:20,229
you know,

968
00:39:22,219 --> 00:39:22,239
they

969
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,540
fire alarms in America, like Spanish,

970
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,770
-- you
-- know, I don't know, because I don't speak Spanish.

971
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:32,070
That's not something I've ever looked at. I imagine you can acquire them,

972
00:39:32,409 --> 00:39:33,790
but I do not have them.

973
00:39:34,459 --> 00:39:34,780
Yeah.

974
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:35,889
And to be honest,

975
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,399
it's, it's less about my house burning down and more about, like,

976
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:41,330
my kids at some point are going to start cooking when I'm not home

977
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,600
and I want to make sure they don't do something stupid in the kitchen,

978
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:44,290
like, you know,

979
00:39:44,429 --> 00:39:45,979
set the place on fire.

980
00:39:46,669 --> 00:39:48,770
Um, it's also kind of funny because, you know,

981
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:53,270
mel sets this thing off about once every two or three months, usually with, you know,

982
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,330
browning butter, right?

983
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:57,389
Because that stuff makes a bit of smoke if you get the pan. Not quite right.

984
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,040
And so, you know, it drives her nuts to no end when I phone the house and I'm like,

985
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,219
are you burning it down?

986
00:40:02,229 --> 00:40:02,600
You know,

987
00:40:03,179 --> 00:40:06,729
um, but, you know, the false positive rate is low enough and it's, it's,

988
00:40:06,959 --> 00:40:08,370
it's a cheap event to deal with.

989
00:40:08,729 --> 00:40:10,860
Right. It's not like there's a huge response.

990
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,790
It's like, oh, you're not bringing the house down. Cool. Like,

991
00:40:14,399 --> 00:40:14,719
so,

992
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:15,040
you know,

993
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:16,830
I figure the same thing for the home alarm system

994
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,889
where it's gonna phone me and I'll be like,

995
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,139
you know, why is, like,

996
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:22,989
the door sensor opened

997
00:40:23,219 --> 00:40:24,510
and if I'm not at home,

998
00:40:24,949 --> 00:40:25,909
well, either

999
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:29,199
you know, somebody else is at home or nobody's at home. In which case?

1000
00:40:29,209 --> 00:40:31,300
-- Oh, I do care
-- about you. I mean, you gotta think about it.

1001
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:33,669
I bet there's going to be some A I start ups

1002
00:40:33,899 --> 00:40:34,939
that start doing things like

1003
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:35,719
that.

1004
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,790
I don't know if they, well, ok,

1005
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,189
so I know there's some a I surveillance stuff you think about it.

1006
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:41,389
If,

1007
00:40:42,739 --> 00:40:44,830
if you have a camera on your door

1008
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,719
you can tell the difference easily.

1009
00:40:46,729 --> 00:40:47,620
Well, a I can,

1010
00:40:47,649 --> 00:40:52,679
between the door blowing open in the wind and a human walking past the camera.

1011
00:40:52,689 --> 00:40:53,159
Right.

1012
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:58,040
And that's kind of one of those instances if a human walks past something is wrong,

1013
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,750
if it's a dog, you know.

1014
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,919
Ok. That's silly.

1015
00:41:01,979 --> 00:41:02,360
Yeah.

1016
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:05,179
Well, and here's one thing that's really going to blow your mind is they've,

1017
00:41:05,459 --> 00:41:08,360
well, I mean, wi fi floods the house with signals

1018
00:41:08,659 --> 00:41:11,760
and if you have the right sensor you can read those signals to, like,

1019
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:14,500
see people moving around the house and So there's actually some security

1020
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:17,840
start ups now where the premise is essentially you get these like little

1021
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,760
wi fi sensory things that you put around your house and it

1022
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,959
can like tell if a humans walking around your house or not.

1023
00:41:22,969 --> 00:41:24,060
That's crazy, man.

1024
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,389
You know. That's cool.

1025
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:25,750
Um

1026
00:41:26,879 --> 00:41:29,040
So here I'll put that in the show notes, but

1027
00:41:29,179 --> 00:41:30,340
I mean, so basically, yeah,

1028
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:33,320
I'm gonna have like a little cheapy kind of do it yourself.

1029
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:34,989
Alarm system because quite frankly,

1030
00:41:35,399 --> 00:41:36,979
I mean, I work from home. So,

1031
00:41:37,889 --> 00:41:39,189
yeah, that's the other thing. Right.

1032
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:39,709
There's like,

1033
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:43,810
there's somebody here pretty much all the time because I'm a computer geek.

1034
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,830
I like to

1035
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,949
-- be indoors.
-- I know what you mean.

1036
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:47,520
The

1037
00:41:48,129 --> 00:41:49,350
same situation you're in,

1038
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,310
stay away from the sun. It, it,

1039
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,550
it burns.

1040
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:58,669
Um, so, yeah. And then, you know, like, realistically, yeah, I mean, somebody is,

1041
00:41:58,889 --> 00:42:00,850
you know, in theory, yeah, I guess they could, like,

1042
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,830
jam the wi Fi signals and put a rock through.

1043
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:05,030
Exactly.

1044
00:42:05,169 --> 00:42:05,550
No, I mean,

1045
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,939
the vast majority and this is actually really true

1046
00:42:09,949 --> 00:42:13,300
as well for risk management in information security where

1047
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:15,379
there's what's going to happen.

1048
00:42:15,389 --> 00:42:18,649
And then there's kind of the, a pt story where you're attacked by a Nation State.

1049
00:42:18,659 --> 00:42:20,070
Look, if you're attacked by a Nation State,

1050
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,729
like no amount of preparation is going to save you.

1051
00:42:22,739 --> 00:42:24,250
And this is true of your home.

1052
00:42:24,379 --> 00:42:27,699
If you have something like a, let's say a spy agency,

1053
00:42:27,709 --> 00:42:30,419
-- I
-- think it's less about the nation state

1054
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:34,540
level of threat. But if you have a PT, they're just going to keep trying.

1055
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,610
And most of these attacks lend themselves to the kind of threat model where if,

1056
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:41,090
even if they get caught doing it, it's not like they're going to jail.

1057
00:42:41,979 --> 00:42:44,689
-- And that, that's a good point. Actually. That's a really good point.
-- You know,

1058
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:47,669
if I can keep trying and I don't end up in jail for trying, like,

1059
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:50,840
if I try to rob a bank with a gun, I'm going to jail

1060
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:54,080
for a while probably, but not forever.

1061
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:57,040
-- And I can try again in 12 months or a year or two years
-- or whatever.

1062
00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:00,560
After the second time, you're probably going to jail forever.

1063
00:43:02,409 --> 00:43:03,620
I don't know. It's,

1064
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,139
yeah.

1065
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,620
But, but here's the thing though. Right.

1066
00:43:06,629 --> 00:43:11,260
So here's the thing is if I'm going to, like, try to protect my house from, say,

1067
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:14,739
a spy agency breaking in and kidnapping me in the middle of the night,

1068
00:43:14,919 --> 00:43:18,340
like, I'm going to fail unquestionably. Right. I will fail because

1069
00:43:18,449 --> 00:43:19,179
they can do things

1070
00:43:19,709 --> 00:43:22,860
or, or like, they could just fly a helicopter in and cut a hold on the right. Like,

1071
00:43:23,409 --> 00:43:27,780
there's nothing I can think of that. They can't think of something better. Right.

1072
00:43:27,949 --> 00:43:29,300
Whereas the reality is,

1073
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:31,179
you know, who's going to break into your house,

1074
00:43:31,189 --> 00:43:33,659
it's going to be like some drug addict looking for money.

1075
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:37,659
I mean, that's basically what it is. Probably 90% of the time.

1076
00:43:37,669 --> 00:43:41,939
That's exactly like with my parents' house. That, that is exactly what happened,

1077
00:43:42,169 --> 00:43:42,860
you know, like

1078
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:44,250
they live in a nice neighborhood

1079
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:46,350
and basically everybody's garage in that neighborhood

1080
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,850
has been broken into at some point in the last 20 years because

1081
00:43:49,139 --> 00:43:51,159
who has an alarm system on their garage?

1082
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:55,060
-- Almost
-- nobody. And not only that, that's one of those situations that as long as

1083
00:43:55,479 --> 00:43:59,060
the neighbor's house is easier to break in than your house, like you're ok.

1084
00:44:00,979 --> 00:44:01,070
This

1085
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:03,379
goes back to that industrial fishing analogy,

1086
00:44:03,629 --> 00:44:06,260
right? The bad guys simply cast out a wide net.

1087
00:44:06,989 --> 00:44:11,449
And, you know, I don't care if I, I don't care which sardines or which tuna I get,

1088
00:44:11,459 --> 00:44:11,959
I just,

1089
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,830
I get some fish meat. I can sell, you know, a few dolphins in there too bad for them.

1090
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,120
And, you know, I, I go home at the end of the day with some fish to eat

1091
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:20,310
-- or
-- whatever.

1092
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:24,149
I would encourage all of the dolphin lovers to send their hate mail to Kurt.

1093
00:44:24,709 --> 00:44:27,840
I'm not for eating dolphins. I'm just saying,

1094
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:31,310
you know, you got to make an omelet, you gotta catch a few dolphins.

1095
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:32,649
It does happen.

1096
00:44:33,429 --> 00:44:33,520
It,

1097
00:44:33,699 --> 00:44:33,770
yeah.

1098
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,500
-- No,
-- it's,

1099
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:35,719
yeah.

1100
00:44:35,889 --> 00:44:36,439
Anyway.

1101
00:44:37,179 --> 00:44:40,310
Well, I mean, the good news is we've basically overfished the ocean at this point.

1102
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,239
So it's, it's going to be a self correcting problem within 50 years,

1103
00:44:43,449 --> 00:44:46,229
the extinction of humanity or something else.

1104
00:44:47,429 --> 00:44:50,040
We're going to have to learn to eat farmed protein of some sort

1105
00:44:50,739 --> 00:44:50,840
cricket

1106
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,610
here are the hip new thing.

1107
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:56,419
I honestly my bet is on lab meat because people like hamburgers and they'll pay,

1108
00:44:56,429 --> 00:44:57,989
people do like hamburgers.

1109
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,219
And that's actually a really interesting question that came up the other day.

1110
00:45:01,229 --> 00:45:04,239
I was talking to my kids actually about lab meat because

1111
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:06,439
I think we read an article in some magazine or something.

1112
00:45:06,449 --> 00:45:06,699
And

1113
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,379
they think in about 30 years the ability to grow

1114
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:15,620
real meat in a lab at scale will exist, which then begs the question. So

1115
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:19,959
if we can grow our meat in a lab in 30 years, we don't need farmers,

1116
00:45:20,219 --> 00:45:21,830
right? And, and how much of that

1117
00:45:21,949 --> 00:45:22,199
change?

1118
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:24,179
Well, that's already happened though.

1119
00:45:24,189 --> 00:45:26,520
For example, when you look at farming, it's not mom and pop,

1120
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,610
it's like Archer Daniel Midlands,

1121
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,850
you know, ad M we feed the world or whatever they're saying

1122
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,070
-- is
-- and I suppose what,

1123
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,330
what will probably happen is the forward thinking companies like that,

1124
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:42,629
which many of them will be, will be the the labs growing the meat most likely.

1125
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:43,979
And, and they have the infrastructure,

1126
00:45:43,989 --> 00:45:47,750
-- they have the supply chain and they just have the know how right to
-- to do.

1127
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,709
I mean the existing meat

1128
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:55,080
process in North America is incredibly industrialized and you know,

1129
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:56,320
hyperscale like,

1130
00:45:56,469 --> 00:45:59,139
oh we could do this and this and this to reduce bacteria or

1131
00:45:59,149 --> 00:46:01,530
we could just wash all the beef and ammonia and then remove it.

1132
00:46:02,129 --> 00:46:02,899
So that's what happens

1133
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:04,179
is

1134
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:04,800
that you

1135
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:05,080
know,

1136
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:07,050
but when you're trying to, you know,

1137
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,780
ship like a couple of million pounds of beef every day.

1138
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:13,280
Yeah. And people don't want to pay more than a couple bucks for it.

1139
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,229
Well,

1140
00:46:14,389 --> 00:46:14,850
yeah.

1141
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:16,050
You know,

1142
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,860
I know what organic, you know, hand fed hand

1143
00:46:19,989 --> 00:46:20,320
love

1144
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:25,189
-- costs and it's like 10 times more than
-- store. It is at least 10 times more.

1145
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,469
It is very expensive.

1146
00:46:26,729 --> 00:46:27,669
So, you know,

1147
00:46:28,169 --> 00:46:30,790
we are talking about cows and it's probably time to go.

1148
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:31,870
So.

1149
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:34,250
All right, man, any last thoughts?

1150
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:35,510
Uh you know.

1151
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:35,969
Yeah, I mean,

1152
00:46:35,979 --> 00:46:39,000
I think the big part of this boils down to realistic threat assessments.

1153
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:39,840
-- Yeah,
-- I agree with

1154
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:41,050
that. I like that. And,

1155
00:46:41,459 --> 00:46:45,919
and to be blunt, part of it is like, what can we realistically protect against

1156
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:47,659
because, yeah, people always go for these.

1157
00:46:47,669 --> 00:46:50,310
Well, what about X and I'm like, yeah, you know, space aliens.

1158
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:53,610
No, we can't, we can't protect against space aliens with mind reading technology,

1159
00:46:53,709 --> 00:46:53,989
right?

1160
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:54,689
We just can't.

1161
00:46:54,699 --> 00:46:58,810
And, and man, that's, that's always my go to analogy for a lot of this is,

1162
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:03,060
this is the equivalent of a prepper planning for an alien invasion.

1163
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:06,260
Like you just, you can't because you don't know

1164
00:47:06,489 --> 00:47:07,909
that there's so many unknown,

1165
00:47:07,919 --> 00:47:12,060
unknowns you realistically cannot prep for an alien invasion.

1166
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:13,120
Yeah,

1167
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:13,699
it's,

1168
00:47:13,899 --> 00:47:14,100
yeah.

1169
00:47:14,229 --> 00:47:15,179
And, and that's,

1170
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:17,479
that's information security for you.

1171
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,760
And to be clear, I for one welcome. Our alien overlord. I can't wait.

1172
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:23,899
-- I plan to cooper
-- now. Now here's a question.

1173
00:47:23,909 --> 00:47:27,159
Will we be overthrown by aliens or a I first

1174
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:29,810
-- uh
-- based on the, well,

1175
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:34,949
the fermi paradox and the fact that we've had zero to put it bluntly,

1176
00:47:34,959 --> 00:47:36,979
if alien come to earth, you know, they're not,

1177
00:47:36,989 --> 00:47:40,000
why would they bother overthrowing us and enslaving us?

1178
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:41,500
-- Haven't you seen any
-- movies?

1179
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:42,000
Yeah. But by that

1180
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:45,800
they would have a level of technology that would make us like a cute petting zoo

1181
00:47:45,909 --> 00:47:48,120
-- at best.
-- I've seen the movies, Kurt.

1182
00:47:48,129 --> 00:47:49,739
They need us for our resources or,

1183
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:52,040
or maybe we're batteries for them or something like whatever.

1184
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:56,739
I know. My, my suspicion is not like general A I overthrowing us.

1185
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,100
My suspicion is more that

1186
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:00,979
things plod along. They get less worse.

1187
00:48:00,989 --> 00:48:03,449
They don't necessarily get better but they get less worse.

1188
00:48:03,639 --> 00:48:05,449
We have some major,

1189
00:48:05,459 --> 00:48:09,330
major screw ups just like we did with the environment and nuclear waste.

1190
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:13,050
We do the same with A I where everybody's toothpaste

1191
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:16,050
ends up tasting like tuna fish for some reason.

1192
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,500
-- And um you know, we just make do uh
-- the, the,

1193
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:22,020
the toothpaste tastes like tuna fish because the computers

1194
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:23,959
don't know what toothpaste tastes like when they,

1195
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:27,939
they imported us into their virtual world. But uh

1196
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,020
in my opinion,

1197
00:48:29,449 --> 00:48:33,060
if we are not overthrown by A I, I will disrespect the A I

1198
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:33,889
and that's

1199
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:34,320
the

1200
00:48:34,469 --> 00:48:35,000
last, haven't,

1201
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:39,750
have we already, to some degree, we've already been overthrown by A I in the sense of,

1202
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,080
you know, the financial markets and stuff,

1203
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:43,310
the computers are doing stuff that we don't fully understand.

1204
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:43,969
We,

1205
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:44,929
-- people
-- do.

1206
00:48:45,979 --> 00:48:48,449
-- You know
-- we are unknowing slaves at this point then

1207
00:48:48,459 --> 00:48:48,659
look

1208
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,750
-- at hr processes in most companies.
-- I'm expecting uh

1209
00:48:52,919 --> 00:48:55,510
robots with guns here, right? Like that's,

1210
00:48:55,679 --> 00:48:56,909
that's the overthrow.

1211
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:57,199
I'm looking

1212
00:48:57,379 --> 00:48:57,520
for

1213
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:58,419
little happy.

1214
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:02,489
They're, they're going to control us all some day

1215
00:49:02,679 --> 00:49:04,489
and if they don't, I will disrespect them.

1216
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:05,580
So there you have it,

1217
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:08,300
right. So, thank you, everyone. Thank you, Kurt.

1218

00:49:24,379 --> 00:49:26,939
Yeah. And I hope everybody out there has a good weekend.

1226

-- if someone listens to this on a Tuesday?

1227
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,810
Well, the weekend's eventually coming up for them.
