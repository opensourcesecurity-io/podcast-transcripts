Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Curtsey Fried

1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,560
and my partner in Sound Audio crime. Josh Pressers. That's right. We have spent

2
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,000
longer than I want to admit trying to figure out

3
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,399
why my audio while talking to Kurt was messing.

4
00:00:22,209 --> 00:00:25,530
Would you like to tell the audience why it was messed up? Kurt?

5
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,479
Well, the suspicion is, it's my USB port. It was Kurt's fault, not mine.

6
00:00:29,569 --> 00:00:30,940
And I was the one

7
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,319
trying to sort all this out on my side

8
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,939
assuming there was something wrong with my microphone.

9
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,599
And then you had the brilliant idea of listen to some audio on your computer.

10
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:41,319
And I'm like, oh,

11
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,639
yeah. No, that's broken too.

12
00:00:42,889 --> 00:00:47,759
Well, that's because I recorded myself. And then, and what makes it even more fun

13
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:48,919
and more tragic

14
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,860
is my first thought was I will reboot

15
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,490
and I was in Windows to do the recording

16
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:56,729
and then when it came back up because I dual boot

17
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,689
this computer every now and then something happens to like the

18
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,950
boot loader and windows makes me go to a website and

19
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:06,330
type in a hilariously long key to prove I am me

20
00:01:06,589 --> 00:01:09,290
because a bit locker stuff and that popped up.

21
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,730
So, I'm recording on Linux now, which I probably should have been doing anyway.

22
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,849
But I was lazy and I didn't want to make it all work. But anyway, anyway,

23
00:01:16,389 --> 00:01:20,690
I also have another hilarious story to tell

24
00:01:21,059 --> 00:01:21,839
in my

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
interesting life, I guess. Well, I have two things.

26
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,410
So, first of all I started a new job last week, which is very exciting.

27
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,129
I'm the vice president of Security at Encor, which is awesome.

28
00:01:31,279 --> 00:01:32,029
Yeah, I had to,

29
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,540
I had to update all my contact list

30
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,809
for you because it keeps default because alphabetically.

31
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:36,209
Right.

32
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,069
Oh. Right. Right. Yes. Well, and I don't have your new one.

33
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,690
So, obviously a comes before e

34
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,930
uh, yes, that's true. That's true.

35
00:01:43,066 --> 00:01:46,146
And, and I've, it's been three whole days at this point. So

36
00:01:46,276 --> 00:01:49,166
that, that's cool. I'll, I'll, I'll have more to say at some point, I'm sure.

37
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:52,805
And then the other thing that happened, this is hilarious is, uh,

38
00:01:52,816 --> 00:01:56,106
it was actually exactly one week ago today at the time of recording

39
00:01:56,335 --> 00:02:02,085
the pickup truck I've owned for 21 years. Finally gave up the ghost. It is done.

40
00:02:02,096 --> 00:02:04,055
Well, no, my understanding is something broke on it.

41
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:06,662
That's ok to live without if you don't care about the environment.

42
00:02:06,802 --> 00:02:09,382
Well, no, it's not ok to live without. It will murder you.

43
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,341
So, what happened was the exhaust manifold.

44
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:15,401
The thing that comes off the engine that all the exhaust goes into,

45
00:02:15,412 --> 00:02:18,341
there's three pipes on each side because it's a V six engine,

46
00:02:18,352 --> 00:02:21,701
all of the exhaust goes through these pipes and then it goes

47
00:02:21,712 --> 00:02:24,182
through the catalytic converter and the muffler and all that jazz.

48
00:02:24,201 --> 00:02:24,212
Uh,

49
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,052
basically one of my pipes broke

50
00:02:27,339 --> 00:02:31,460
and it's going to cost more than the truck is literally worth to replace.

51
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,419
Assuming nothing terrible goes wrong in the process,

52
00:02:34,429 --> 00:02:38,229
which could increase the price to infinity as they're working on a 21

53
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,880
year old engine or considering what else they find wrong with it.

54
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:42,809
Well, there's everything is wrong with this thing.

55
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,139
In fact,

56
00:02:43,149 --> 00:02:47,059
I even like the mechanic and I have an agreement that if it isn't going to kill anyone,

57
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:48,320
don't worry about

58
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:48,789
it.

59
00:02:49,462 --> 00:02:51,802
Like the check engine line has been on for probably

60
00:02:51,813 --> 00:02:54,522
a decade at this point and the door lock doesn't,

61
00:02:54,533 --> 00:02:56,852
the, the electronic door locks don't work anymore.

62
00:02:56,863 --> 00:03:00,453
Uh, the passenger side window doesn't roll down anymore like it has many,

63
00:03:00,462 --> 00:03:01,412
many problems.

64
00:03:01,423 --> 00:03:04,173
So anyway, anyway, what I did actually, truck dies,

65
00:03:04,182 --> 00:03:06,402
whatever I expected that I knew it was coming.

66
00:03:06,412 --> 00:03:09,132
I'm sad. It happened now because buying a new car is really hard actually.

67
00:03:09,343 --> 00:03:10,322
So I ended up with

68
00:03:10,485 --> 00:03:12,546
a Nissan Leaf electric car.

69
00:03:12,555 --> 00:03:16,386
It was the literally the only electric car I could find that was actually in stock,

70
00:03:16,466 --> 00:03:16,945
but

71
00:03:17,046 --> 00:03:20,626
I, I was like, I want an electric car and so I found one, I bought it and

72
00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:23,085
it is a cool little car. I'm really happy with it.

73
00:03:23,095 --> 00:03:26,186
Well, and so, and apparently they won't burn down your house when you charge it,

74
00:03:26,195 --> 00:03:26,686
I guess.

75
00:03:26,695 --> 00:03:29,666
Look, I would have bought a Chevy if they would have sold me one man.

76
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:31,945
I mean, I'm kind of glad they did it because I think

77
00:03:32,395 --> 00:03:36,865
I bought a used Nissan leaf that's a year old, didn't have a ton of miles on it.

78
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:41,809
And it, it has all like the weird, like, level two driving auto,

79
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,119
whatever they call that stuff,

80
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:43,410
I

81
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,279
think.

82
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,679
Yeah. Yeah, it's got whatever.

83
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,720
But anyway, so it could do, like, basically it can drive on the highway by itself.

84
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,800
Right. Which I still have to touch the wheel occasionally or yells at me. But,

85
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,839
and, and the, the Chevy wouldn't have done that.

86
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,970
So, but still, like, 66 Chevys exploded.

87
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:01,339
That's not bad out of however many what, hundreds of thousands they sold.

88
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:01,639
Like, well,

89
00:04:01,649 --> 00:04:03,619
it reminds me of when those Mercedes smart

90
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,649
cars kept catching fire and Mercedes of course,

91
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,509
is like, well, it's your fault and then, no,

92
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,500
it turned out to be like a manufacturing defect.

93
00:04:10,369 --> 00:04:13,529
Yeah. Right. Right. Because as I understand it, cars are, um,

94
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,790
not supposed to catch fire, I mean, I guess.

95
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,928
But, but anyway, anyway, it's, uh, no, it's fun.

96
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,980
And then, and then, so what makes it even more fun is I had to,

97
00:04:23,989 --> 00:04:27,059
I had to put a 220 volt outlet in my

98
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,450
garage to charge it because it comes with the charger for

99
00:04:30,989 --> 00:04:33,380
like just 100 and 20 volt, you know, crappy us power.

100
00:04:33,619 --> 00:04:36,209
It's like plugging your ipad into those one AMP chargers

101
00:04:36,549 --> 00:04:40,269
while you're using it. And you can just see the battery dying less slowly.

102
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,709
Yeah. So it would take 48 hours to charge it

103
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:47,380
with a, a regular plug, which I will say is unacceptable.

104
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:50,470
But now that I have like a proper outlet and all that jazz, I'm curious, what,

105
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,929
how many amps does that thing draw?

106
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:58,480
Like? Is it a 40 amp circuit or 50? So the, the charger I have can do 36 amps at 220 volts.

107
00:04:58,489 --> 00:04:59,230
But when you plug it into

108
00:04:59,359 --> 00:05:04,450
20 I was plugged into a 15 amp outlet. So, so you're limited to about 12. Like, yeah.

109
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:05,480
So anyway, anyway,

110
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:06,640
that's kind of my story.

111
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:09,619
It's been a very, it was a very hectic end of the week,

112
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:12,760
last week because it was the end of my work at Elastic which I,

113
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:14,859
I'm very grateful for and I still love elastic.

114
00:05:14,869 --> 00:05:15,579
It was a very

115
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,010
amicable parting but truck dies,

116
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,160
leave my job, go buy a car. It was funny because I went to the auto dealership.

117
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:22,579
I'm like,

118
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,679
I, I don't have any money right now because it's being transferred.

119
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:30,040
Can I get a loan and I'm unemployed? Technically,

120
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:32,119
it all worked out in the end,

121
00:05:32,309 --> 00:05:33,839
which is really funny. But

122
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:38,609
yeah, every time anybody asks me my employment history apart. From those.

123
00:05:38,619 --> 00:05:40,279
Out of the last 20.

124
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,980
Oh, my. Out of the last 23 years I've technically only been employed for seven of them

125
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:47,980
because you work for yourself. Right. I'm a contractor

126
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:50,339
in

127
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:50,730
Canada.

128
00:05:51,109 --> 00:05:54,380
We have a real topic that isn't just Josh's life.

129
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,299
So. 01 quick thought. I'm just curious.

130
00:05:57,309 --> 00:06:00,500
Have you figured out how much time you're gonna save on not having to gas up your car?

131
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:04,260
Because I just had the random thought, like, if you save five minutes a week,

132
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,709
not gassing up your car that adds up.

133
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:13,910
I mean, I'm, I don't gas up my car once a week. I'm, I'm skeptical it will be a number

134
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:17,809
of any significance. I'm more excited to just not buy gas

135
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,390
because I think electricity is cool.

136
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,380
Yeah, I'm aware with you on that

137
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,739
and, and I've got a little app so it's like starting to track

138
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:30,940
my use. And, like, yesterday I drove 15 miles.

139
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:34,320
I don't, I don't drive a lot, obviously pick up my kids mostly at school

140
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,600
and it used 50 cents worth of electricity,

141
00:06:36,609 --> 00:06:38,359
which I don't know if that is in kilometers.

142
00:06:38,369 --> 00:06:38,929
That's,

143
00:06:39,429 --> 00:06:39,859
uh, I

144
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:46,739
don't know. It is times 1.6. So it's about 2023. There you go.

145
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:52,510
So 23 kilometers, 50 cents, 50 us cents worth of electricity.

146
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,109
That's actually a lot cheaper than gas.

147
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:54,910
Uh, it is.

148
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,329
They, well, they, I mean, yeah,

149
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:57,910
they're way cheaper than gas and the price of

150
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,059
gas is going up and the price of electricity is

151
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,269
pretty much the same.

152
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:05,589
I drive a smaller car and I, my last tank, Philip was almost 60 bucks. Canadian.

153
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,109
Right.

154
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:09,350
And, and you like your, your, your petrol is expensive.

155
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:11,290
I live in the United States where it's

156
00:07:11,299 --> 00:07:13,910
comically cheap and people still complain about it.

157
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,190
I've, I've lived in Europe. So when you say expensive money

158
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,190
expectation is about,

159
00:07:18,429 --> 00:07:18,619
yeah.

160
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,029
Right. Right. Yeah, because in Europe it's like double the price per liter.

161
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,089
And anyway, this is a security podcast. We're done. We're done.

162
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,510
We are going to talk about the U A parser,

163
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,239
debacle. We'll call it. It was

164
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,369
OK. I'll go with that. Maybe I

165
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,209
should say debacle. I think,

166
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,630
I think actually it's a debacle but not so much on the sense of the U A parser,

167
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,480
but on the response to it.

168
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:45,609
Um And, and not for the reasons, I think a lot of people think we're going to take,

169
00:07:45,619 --> 00:07:47,190
well, well, first let's kind of explain

170
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,320
what's going on.

171
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:53,339
There's a, a node Js library called the U A parser. It's a user agent parser.

172
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:56,700
And the idea is when you connect with the web browser to a thing,

173
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:57,540
it,

174
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,989
your web browser sends a user agent and then depending upon what your user agent is,

175
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,880
things might be different because obviously,

176
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,399
like if you're coming from a chrome machine

177
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:08,359
or a Firefox machine,

178
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:09,320
it's not a machine.

179
00:08:09,549 --> 00:08:09,940
Um

180
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,260
But you know what I mean? Like you can kind of show things in a different way. Right.

181
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,359
And this is just a library to help with that. And basically

182
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:19,119
it looks like an attacker

183
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:20,920
managed to

184
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,839
insert a backdoor

185
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,519
and upload new

186
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:28,959
packages. Yeah, packages to know N PM.

187
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,299
And then they were there for about four hours.

188
00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:33,640
People found them, they got it all pulled down.

189
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,429
And what amuses me is somebody immediately was like, why,

190
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,390
why is my antivirus triggering on this?

191
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:39,789
Right. Right. I mean,

192
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:43,308
it was not subtle if I was going to

193
00:08:43,739 --> 00:08:46,028
describe a, a

194
00:08:46,138 --> 00:08:49,359
ideal scenario of malware,

195
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:50,239
you know,

196
00:08:50,249 --> 00:08:52,989
going into the pipeline being found and

197
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,838
removed like this actually went really well,

198
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:55,679
it was four hours.

199
00:08:55,689 --> 00:08:56,848
It wasn't a long time,

200
00:08:57,098 --> 00:08:57,638
but

201
00:08:58,789 --> 00:08:59,849
everyone

202
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,700
I've,

203
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:07,309
I've seen is now talking about how it's unacceptable that N PM doesn't enforce

204
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,659
two factor off and we need to be signing everything with keys and we need

205
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:16,049
better supply chain policies and tracking and all this and the thing I,

206
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:18,719
I keep thinking every time I read this is

207
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:21,320
I don't think you're wrong,

208
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:23,549
but none of this is free

209
00:09:23,859 --> 00:09:27,580
and most of most of N PM is literally

210
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,080
a person who does it for fun. You know what I mean? Like this is

211
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:34,630
you can't ask a volunteer

212
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:38,179
to jump through these hoops. Well, it's worse than that because

213
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,200
you can make the hoops easier.

214
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,530
So a great example of two factor authentication is at the strongest end.

215
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:46,719
You've got hardware tokens like UB hes and, you know, Google Titan,

216
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,659
you know, where you have to physically hunt me down and steal my physical key for me.

217
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:51,630
Right.

218
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:52,510
And then,

219
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:56,510
you know, on the, on the really, still pretty good end you got like an app on a phone,

220
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,119
like Google Authenticator or free OTP or

221
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:03,270
Microsoft, uh, whatever it's called with a little stupid looking icon.

222
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:03,799
And

223
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:05,349
those are pretty solid, right?

224
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:08,340
Like, again, you'd have to hack my phone or steal my phone and

225
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:09,289
yeah, that's,

226
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,809
yeah, on a modern phone, hacking the phone remotely,

227
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,289
it's doable as we've discussed.

228
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,809
Yeah, this is a good example because two factor authentication you can.

229
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:21,039
So at the, at the top end of the kind of gold standard we've got hardware tokens,

230
00:10:21,049 --> 00:10:23,169
you know, like UB keys, Google Titan.

231
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,570
I don't know any other brand names and you know,

232
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,450
those are great because you have to physically mug

233
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,169
me and steal my physical keys to get in.

234
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,400
And then

235
00:10:31,669 --> 00:10:32,539
pretty good.

236
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,789
Like I would say 95 to 99% as good is,

237
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:38,960
is the software app on your phone because a modern phone kept up to date,

238
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:42,580
you know, unless a state level attacker attacks you, in which case they're,

239
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,460
they're gonna win.

240
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,280
Sorry,

241
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,539
again, pretty good.

242
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:49,909
But, oh man, setting those things up, that could be tricky. And then

243
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,789
on the easy side,

244
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,130
you've got a

245
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:54,549
phone based like,

246
00:10:54,669 --> 00:10:56,479
sorry, I should say phone number based

247
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,419
so S MS or a voice call.

248
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,760
But those cost money to send.

249
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:01,320
Uh, but,

250
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:04,900
but even ignoring that the amount of work that has to

251
00:11:04,909 --> 00:11:08,440
be done by a package maintainer to support this stuff is,

252
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,780
is quite significant.

253
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,539
And then, well, and you've got the simple one which I hate,

254
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:15,059
but also kind of makes sense is that the email based

255
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,349
two fa which honestly if you do account recovery via email,

256
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,559
it's the same thing because somebody attacks your email,

257
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,169
they can hijack your account regardless.

258
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:26,940
Right. You've got to get people to actually set this up and, like, not

259
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:28,559
lose their token or not,

260
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,969
you know, accidentally wipe their phone or buy a new phone

261
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,140
or,

262
00:11:33,549 --> 00:11:34,440
you know, all

263
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:37,739
it's a hassle because as soon as you add stronger,

264
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,320
uh, account security,

265
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,650
the chances that people have to do account recovery increase.

266
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,539
That's right.

267
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:47,130
And then that shifts cost into something like the N PM

268
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:51,520
project because now you have to have a way for people to

269
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,369
update their stuff.

270
00:11:53,489 --> 00:11:54,330
And it's,

271
00:11:54,719 --> 00:11:55,239
I mean,

272
00:11:56,369 --> 00:11:58,619
the thing I keep thinking about all this is so

273
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:01,989
supply chain is a hugely popular topic right now

274
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:02,900
and

275
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,750
we've seen a handful of problems here and there pop up and,

276
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,260
and generally speaking in the open source world,

277
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,390
I think most have been dealt with very quickly, which is really good.

278
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,869
And I think that is,

279
00:12:14,849 --> 00:12:16,479
I, I won't say it's expected,

280
00:12:16,489 --> 00:12:19,700
but we'll say I'm not surprised the reality is number one,

281
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:22,309
we only know of a few big private

282
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,880
closed source hacks because they were so bad that they made the news,

283
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,109
they had to make the news

284
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:29,690
and when you look at the timelines on them,

285
00:12:30,109 --> 00:12:32,950
like I'm gonna pick on solar winds because they're a big company with a lot of money.

286
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,890
So we're gonna punch up at them

287
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:36,590
and, uh, like,

288
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:39,409
they literally could not have handled it much worse other

289
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:41,359
than just completely ignoring it and letting it go.

290
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,109
Well, I, I will say though, after the fact

291
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:46,799
they've been owning this pretty well

292
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,140
and

293
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:48,419
talking about it, I

294
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,489
want to continue to exist and have government customers.

295
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,200
Yeah, that's probably true. But regardless. So there's,

296
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,179
I, I feel like if you're dealing with a corporate entity,

297
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:01,080
you could easily make these requests.

298
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,900
But when we're dealing with open source

299
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:04,349
there,

300
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,419
you can say we should be signing things, we should be enforcing true factor.

301
00:13:09,429 --> 00:13:12,270
We should be doing all this stuff and some of it is getting easier.

302
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,169
Like if you look at the work happening in

303
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:15,010
cigar,

304
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:19,599
the ability to sign artifacts while it doesn't quite exist yet, it's really,

305
00:13:19,609 --> 00:13:20,580
really close.

306
00:13:20,989 --> 00:13:21,460
Well,

307
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:24,510
but that leads to one challenge where for example,

308
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,630
instead of having say N PM provide really good account security,

309
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,340
you can just sort of outsource the whole thing by using single sign on and say,

310
00:13:30,349 --> 00:13:32,950
for example, requiring a Facebook or a Google login.

311
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:37,320
But then the problem becomes, you know, which providers do you pick?

312
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,520
How do you anoint them?

313
00:13:38,979 --> 00:13:42,010
How do you get enough coverage of providers so that everybody's happy because,

314
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,559
you know, some people don't want to use Facebook

315
00:13:43,729 --> 00:13:45,559
Microsoft owns N PM now.

316
00:13:46,489 --> 00:13:46,950
Right. Let's see.

317
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:47,580
Windows

318
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:47,809
log

319
00:13:47,969 --> 00:13:48,000
in.

320
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:49,239
Yeah, exactly.

321
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:49,419
Yeah.

322
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,510
And I suspect that might be a bit of a

323
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,690
bridge too far for some of these open source developers.

324
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,140
And then the second problem is

325
00:13:55,659 --> 00:13:57,520
as much as I love Sig Store.

326
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:01,299
My fear is kind of like, let's encrypt. I, I'm really happy to see that.

327
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:04,679
Let's encrypt has competitors now. And so is let's encrypt because

328
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,299
uh like let's encrypt could theoretically go away someday,

329
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,169
right? It's unlikely.

330
00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:13,630
But it's possible and I it would be really bad if Lets

331
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,909
and Crip was the only game in town and then suddenly went away

332
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,409
and, and Looks Star is an open source project.

333
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:23,849
Anyone could run their own registry and their own infrastructure if they wanted to.

334
00:14:23,859 --> 00:14:26,250
There's no reason. And, and I don't think that's,

335
00:14:26,619 --> 00:14:29,840
that is too theoretical. Like we don't even have the meat

336
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,239
on the bones

337
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,599
in, in the Siga

338
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:35,109
universe today to have that conversation.

339
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:36,789
I think you're, you're getting way ahead of yourself.

340
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,559
The question becomes we have all these open source developers

341
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,070
and now there are people saying we, you should do more

342
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:47,710
and the thing I want you to do, you don't want to do.

343
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,820
You know what I'm going to disagree with you.

344
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,539
I don't think a lot of them don't want to do this.

345
00:14:51,989 --> 00:14:54,940
It's just that they have an infinite pile of fires to deal with.

346
00:14:55,419 --> 00:14:56,409
And this is not

347
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,159
that important, to be honest. Does that count as, don't want to do?

348
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:02,309
I mean, you, you're right. I think we're, I think

349
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:03,450
they would,

350
00:15:03,789 --> 00:15:07,719
I think it kind of boils down to like last week's episode uh with uh Chris Weiss.

351
00:15:07,869 --> 00:15:07,890
So

352
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,880
in that a lot of these developers

353
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:12,500
don't understand the benefit of security education.

354
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,169
And once they

355
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:16,849
like, my experience is when a lot of people actually kind of get security,

356
00:15:16,859 --> 00:15:18,940
they're like, 00, I actually do want to learn this,

357
00:15:19,869 --> 00:15:20,989
you know, and same thing with

358
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,250
uh password manager is a great example.

359
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,809
I remember my mother

360
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,549
saying and I quote,

361
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,340
so wait, I only have to remember like two passwords now,

362
00:15:30,789 --> 00:15:33,770
like my phone password and my password manager, password. And I'm like, yeah,

363
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,150
that's the, I'm like, exactly. And she's like,

364
00:15:36,349 --> 00:15:39,200
oh, I like that. I'm like, yes, yes, yes, you will.

365
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:44,140
But ok, so I think you bring up a really important point that I was,

366
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,369
I thought we'd get to later, but now is fine,

367
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:47,159
like

368
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,130
making the secure option, the easy option,

369
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,710
the better is the important thing.

370
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:55,609
But, but today, things like two factor authentication

371
00:15:55,859 --> 00:15:58,419
and signing of artifacts

372
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:01,400
and having multiple sign offs on commits

373
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:05,210
and having a release process. And like, none of that

374
00:16:05,419 --> 00:16:06,559
is the easy.

375
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,940
Well, all requires work

376
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,510
well and worse. It's not

377
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,190
only hard, it's not better.

378
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:14,659
Like,

379
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:18,400
now that I've actually gotten into using a password manager quite religiously,

380
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:21,919
I basically have memorized four passwords.

381
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:25,299
Right. Two work ones and two personal ones. That's it. And I, I love it,

382
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:26,020
you know,

383
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,070
the, the problem with release signing and two fa and so on is it doesn't

384
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:33,219
generally make life that much better.

385
00:16:33,349 --> 00:16:33,700
Like

386
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,729
it just doesn't really like

387
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,760
how does it make life better for the developer?

388
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:43,679
It, it kind of doesn't and even for so on on both both developers,

389
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:47,390
the developer building the package and the developer receiving the package,

390
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:52,250
it doesn't technically change that relationship in a meaningful way.

391
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,789
What signed artifacts do

392
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:59,840
is they allow somewhere upstream to do some verification or you know what I mean?

393
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:00,460
Like

394
00:17:00,989 --> 00:17:04,719
tunnel from A to B like as long as it was secure, then

395
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,959
it doesn't matter what happened between A and B because I checked the signature.

396
00:17:07,969 --> 00:17:09,270
It's correct. OK.

397
00:17:10,098 --> 00:17:13,638
I mean, yeah, kind of, that's a good way to look at it. And I think

398
00:17:14,269 --> 00:17:17,938
this again creates this weird dynamic where

399
00:17:18,249 --> 00:17:19,938
a lot of developers,

400
00:17:20,178 --> 00:17:23,759
I I'm not saying they don't care about security but they want to develop,

401
00:17:23,769 --> 00:17:25,118
they don't want to spend

402
00:17:25,288 --> 00:17:29,438
hours verifying things and checking things and making sure it's OK.

403
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:32,078
And you could argue, oh, we'll just build some tooling and stuff,

404
00:17:32,088 --> 00:17:34,879
but that's also a huge job.

405
00:17:34,889 --> 00:17:37,438
You know, it's hard to do, but we've done that, like,

406
00:17:37,448 --> 00:17:39,708
look at how much better it has made the world.

407
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:40,680
Like

408
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,369
I remember the time before

409
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,119
and it was bad.

410
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,540
Well, this is like

411
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:50,920
III, I work at anchor now. This is literally one of the things they're doing, like

412
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:53,719
the tooling is getting better. And I think,

413
00:17:54,069 --> 00:17:56,680
I, I think it is the future, but there's still,

414
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,229
there's always that aspect of friction

415
00:17:59,439 --> 00:17:59,920
that

416
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:04,359
whatever you do, if, if you increase friction,

417
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:06,719
people find ways around it.

418
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,449
You know what I mean? And that's the challenge.

419
00:18:09,469 --> 00:18:13,000
A lot of historical security friction. Not only are we creating friction,

420
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,810
but then we're saying you have to learn about

421
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:17,560
the friction and spend more time doing the friction

422
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:18,109
and,

423
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,479
and users are like,

424
00:18:19,739 --> 00:18:20,319
no,

425
00:18:20,449 --> 00:18:23,560
yeah, I mean, I agree like my favorite example is always phishing.

426
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:28,300
OK? So we're going to tell you not to click on emails not to open links.

427
00:18:28,569 --> 00:18:32,839
I literally just got an email from my Adobe sales contact with a link to his calendar,

428
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:33,770
right?

429
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:37,310
And you know, like, what am I gonna check it to make sure it's all correct?

430
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:38,540
And then how would you check it?

431
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:43,780
You know, like, so I click show original. Ok. SPFD Kim and D marker. I'll pass it.

432
00:18:43,819 --> 00:18:47,560
Is adobe.com I'm gonna cut and paste it into notepad to make sure it's not, you know,

433
00:18:47,569 --> 00:18:47,819
a homo

434
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:48,500
homo

435
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:52,530
glyph attack, you know, using like some Cyrillic letter D or something.

436
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,290
And OK, it actually does appear to be from adobe.com correctly.

437
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,400
Now, let's see, the link goes to,

438
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,979
I've never seen that domain before.

439
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:02,930
I have no

440
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:03,089
idea

441
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:03,939
what that is.

442
00:19:04,069 --> 00:19:05,349
You clicked it, didn't you?

443
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:09,650
I'm right. Clicking. Copy link address it is.

444
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:10,300
Or

445
00:19:10,709 --> 00:19:12,459
mimas.com. What the heck is or

446
00:19:12,699 --> 00:19:13,969
meas.com?

447
00:19:14,329 --> 00:19:17,530
See, but look at this like you have an audience listening to you now,

448
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:22,239
verify a link and 00, the site cannot be reached seriously.

449
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,760
The root level domain doesn't have a website

450
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,079
but does the subdomain

451
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:27,790
a dopey

452
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:30,030
Adobe?

453
00:19:30,199 --> 00:19:30,569
Noy

454
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,910
A SMB dot What?

455
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:35,060
Like I thought it would be Adobe on something.

456
00:19:35,189 --> 00:19:36,369
OK. OK. That's enough. And

457
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,469
if I, if I just put the, the full Adobe

458
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,099
uh host name in

459
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,530
again, airs out to an error page.

460
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,030
I have to put the full link in with like slash C slash

461
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,939
the user name to get to this guy's calendar to make an appointment.

462
00:19:50,449 --> 00:19:51,449
So basically, it's Paul.

463
00:19:52,069 --> 00:19:52,640
OK.

464
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,260
Yes. Also, I'm just gonna hit unsubscribe.

465
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:59,280
This is, this is the finest segment we've ever done in this podcast.

466
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:03,640
But that's the point. I can't even safely click a link. And II, I tried really hard.

467
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,150
We'll say hard enough

468
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,530
like yes. And, and so this is the point is

469
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,920
we want to tell open source,

470
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,890
these are the expectations we have of you.

471
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:20,780
But we don't, if you're going to say that we need to somehow fund this,

472
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:24,949
this can't just be talk of people saying, oh, you should do this, you should do that.

473
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:28,939
You should sign things who is going to pay for this. None of this is free.

474
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:33,579
It needs funding, it needs sponsorship, it needs accountability

475
00:20:33,739 --> 00:20:36,199
and I feel like that's the piece of the conversation. So

476
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:38,719
a package in N PM gets back doored.

477
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,709
Everyone is like, oh my goodness, look at this, look at this.

478
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:43,630
You need to fix everything you do.

479
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,079
Why can't N PM just throw every file upload through virus total dot com's API is it?

480
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:51,689
No, it's not free at that scale. Well, I'm sure,

481
00:20:51,949 --> 00:20:54,010
you know, Microsoft can probably afford

482
00:20:54,739 --> 00:20:56,900
or Microsoft can just chuck it through theirs.

483
00:20:57,709 --> 00:20:59,719
I mean, I, I don't know, like come on,

484
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:03,189
I think Microsoft can do virus scanning if they can't do virus scanning at scale.

485
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:07,800
Well, they have Defender, right? They, they, they literally have a virus scanner.

486
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:07,989
Well,

487
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,729
like virus total was set up by that Spanish University department and then they,

488
00:21:11,739 --> 00:21:13,209
you know, sold to Google,

489
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:13,869
like

490
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,770
Microsoft's almost a trillion dollar company.

491
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,489
If they can't do this, then that's on them. I mean,

492
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:20,719
I,

493
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:21,680
I

494
00:21:21,939 --> 00:21:24,160
don't know, I don't know if

495
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,150
saying

496
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:28,040
N PM should be responsible. Well, here's the question.

497
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,839
Why shouldn't they scan it for viruses?

498
00:21:29,849 --> 00:21:30,770
Because it would have caught this,

499
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,020
it would have caught this immediately and

500
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,479
they could have flagged it and immediately,

501
00:21:33,489 --> 00:21:33,880
you know.

502
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:39,130
Yeah, I mean, you're right. This is scanning scanning package uploads for viruses.

503
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,280
Seems like a no brain

504
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:44,614
like red hat scans all the RP MS before they go to customers.

505
00:21:44,645 --> 00:21:47,974
And thank goodness we do because remember that, um, for a while,

506
00:21:48,214 --> 00:21:48,545
Ali

507
00:21:48,704 --> 00:21:53,415
A V had that stupid rule. If a file was double zipped, it was flagged as suspicious.

508
00:21:54,114 --> 00:21:58,655
And there was a product that had a double zipped file because it had,

509
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:00,165
what was it? It was like

510
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:03,479
Ruby or Java Based or something and it included some component that then

511
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:06,010
got zipped into a thing to be delivered to the client or whatever.

512
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:06,329
Anyway,

513
00:22:06,339 --> 00:22:08,079
so it flagged this component and I had to write a

514
00:22:08,089 --> 00:22:10,089
knowledge based article and put it on the website because,

515
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:11,449
you know, customers are freaking out.

516
00:22:11,739 --> 00:22:12,400
Right. Right.

517
00:22:12,619 --> 00:22:13,030
You know,

518
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,969
and so one of the things I've historically done is

519
00:22:16,979 --> 00:22:20,479
I've scanned artifacts through virus total before releasing them.

520
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:22,410
Not because I'm worried about them having a virus,

521
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,849
but because I'm worried about them having a

522
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:25,869
false positive that then customers freak out.

523
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,770
Yeah, I've, I've been through that more than once.

524
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,910
And so if, if for that reason, if nothing else,

525
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,270
I virus scan stuff so that I don't have to deal with people freaking out.

526
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,119
But uh there's, you shipped me a virus. I, I think you're right.

527
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,400
But now if we look at it from like the N PM perspective,

528
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,839
I'm not paying them any money.

529
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,040
No. What, what is my expectation from N PM

530
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,660
if I'm just doing N PM, install

531
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,640
$0 are exchanged.

532
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:58,630
I think the expectation in general is that when you release software to the web,

533
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,530
even for free, that it's not a virus ridden pile of garbage.

534
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,359
I feel like you're right,

535
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,719
but I, I'm not willing to

536
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:10,760
put my myself behind that statement yet.

537
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:12,280
I, I feel, I mean this

538
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:14,040
in the world of open source

539
00:23:16,469 --> 00:23:16,890
to be backdoor

540
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:19,479
free. Well, well, here's the question. Let's say

541
00:23:19,609 --> 00:23:20,609
I create an open

542
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:24,119
source package and I purposely put a virus in it.

543
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,800
I put in the release notes,

544
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,989
I have put a virus in this package which no

545
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,229
one will read and then people start to use it.

546
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:33,660
I would say it's ethically wrong. It's

547
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:37,130
maybe, is it, is it illegal? I don't know. But you know what I mean? Like

548
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:39,000
it actually, well, in some jurisdictions,

549
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:42,420
it absolutely would be illegal but part of it would be, there's the,

550
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,630
so there are intentional, like there's like web goat,

551
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,380
like there's web servers and applications with

552
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,530
intentional security flaws for training purposes,

553
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,630
but they're, you know, clearly labeled as such.

554
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,189
Now, if I create an N PM package,

555
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,300
unless it's like,

556
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:00,439
you know, uh this is for example, this N PM package sends the

557
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,699
icard.com string

558
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:05,609
so that you can test if your stuff catches viruses,

559
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,500
right?

560
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,060
Iar.com being, you know,

561
00:24:08,069 --> 00:24:09,859
a harmless text string that we've all agreed

562
00:24:09,869 --> 00:24:12,020
is quote unquote virus for testing purposes.

563
00:24:12,209 --> 00:24:15,430
But if I actually include like, say a crypto minor or some ransomware in it.

564
00:24:16,189 --> 00:24:19,089
Um, ignoring the damage aspect. Let's say I include a back door.

565
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:22,069
Well, there's that aspect of damage, but let's ignore that for a moment.

566
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:25,290
So let's say there's some malware in there that's quote unquote harmless,

567
00:24:25,829 --> 00:24:27,770
but say it impacts system performance. Well,

568
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:30,819
yeah, we expect like let me put it this way.

569
00:24:30,829 --> 00:24:33,010
If somebody's handing out free samples at Costco,

570
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:35,510
it better be actual food.

571
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:37,780
I mean

572
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,589
like if I'm out on the street handing out. Oh, perfect.

573
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:42,869
So I'm out on the street handing out flyers,

574
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,140
you expect them not to be covered in poison?

575
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,510
I I would expect that although I would also not take your flyer because I hate,

576
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,530
I hate taking those.

577
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:50,819
Ok.

578
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:54,270
Ok, you made me think of something and we're, we're getting kind of close to the end.

579
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,109
So maybe, maybe we'll wrap this up and, and think of it this way.

580
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,900
So there's like the whole open source universe, right?

581
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,540
And I think today there's a lot of unfettered use

582
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,780
of open source where people aren't just pulling it in

583
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:07,250
and there's maybe some misunderstandings and what it

584
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,760
is or what's happening or what not.

585
00:25:08,949 --> 00:25:13,239
But if you think about in the context context of like Red Hat, back back in the day,

586
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,920
people didn't trust open source,

587
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,479
but they were willing to trust Red Hat because Red Hat was like,

588
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:20,839
we will do everything we can to make this trustworthy and

589
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:24,959
I think our circle of trust is now expanded to include open source generally.

590
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:32,540
Now, if, if I'm a person making a thing for free and I pull an open source and I, I think

591
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:35,339
that you can make a reasonable expectation that I'm not

592
00:25:35,349 --> 00:25:37,189
going to do a ton of due diligence on that.

593
00:25:37,199 --> 00:25:38,619
Right? I, I think that's fair.

594
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:41,489
But if I'm a company and I'm making a product,

595
00:25:41,719 --> 00:25:43,979
I think there are certain expectations

596
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:49,500
that and in the contracts as well, it's going to spell out a lot of this. So I think that

597
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:54,420
the, the trust is still has to be in the companies. I just think the companies have

598
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,520
maybe, maybe they're not doing the due diligence they should be doing.

599
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,530
Maybe I'm starting to feel like

600
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,010
if you are worried about an N PM package,

601
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:06,900
how are you going to do some verification?

602
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:09,229
Well, let's take a step back too because there's for example,

603
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:13,689
github.com/company name, like Facebook or whatever, where they release stuff,

604
00:26:13,699 --> 00:26:15,989
open source for free, you know,

605
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,030
and again, I would expect that that stuff's virus free.

606
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,359
I would expect that stuff to not have backdoors in it.

607
00:26:21,469 --> 00:26:21,869
Right.

608
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,569
And I, I, no amount of like, oh,

609
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:26,609
we put it in the change log that it has this backdoor so that we can do, you know,

610
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:28,989
performance testing whether you like it or not.

611
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:32,209
No, that I wouldn't be shocked if Facebook stuff

612
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,130
had some sort of phone home mechanism

613
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:36,599
and that's different, like there's,

614
00:26:36,609 --> 00:26:39,439
there's lots of phone home mechanisms that are legit, like we want to report,

615
00:26:39,449 --> 00:26:39,800
you know,

616
00:26:40,069 --> 00:26:42,969
um like what your system uh type is so that we can see, you know,

617
00:26:42,979 --> 00:26:45,239
are people running this on Linux or Windows or whatever, right?

618
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:49,150
The reality is I would also expect Facebook wants to protect their brand,

619
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,880
for example, like any major company would want to protect their brand typically.

620
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:54,660
Uh

621
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:57,189
and as such, I would then expect them to,

622
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:59,869
to do some minimal effort to make sure that they're not

623
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,660
shipping, complete flaming open source garbage.

624
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,310
I mean,

625
00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:04,630
yeah, it's,

626
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:11,589
I feel like this is such, I I I've been thinking about this all week and I think there's

627
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,959
still a lot of unanswered questions because you're right, there's the,

628
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:20,239
the the aspect of companies and their brands and their, their open source,

629
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,699
their usage of open source.

630
00:27:21,709 --> 00:27:23,650
There's the open source, I guess here's what,

631
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,040
here's what I would kind of boil it all down as

632
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:28,290
I think, expecting

633
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,560
open source developers

634
00:27:30,729 --> 00:27:32,439
whose stuff you're using

635
00:27:32,699 --> 00:27:39,239
for? Probably free, expecting them to follow your rules is not realistic.

636
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:43,839
So the question becomes, how, how do we incentivize?

637
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:49,319
How, how do we start maybe boiling some trust up into open source?

638
00:27:50,219 --> 00:27:51,589
Because I think that's what this is.

639
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:55,920
I think things like signing packages and multi factor off for

640
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:59,199
uploading artifacts and whatever it's all just about

641
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:04,719
starting to, to put trust in place, but it's not free So how are we gonna pay for it?

642
00:28:04,729 --> 00:28:08,359
How are we gonna add accountability? And I don't think anyone knows that today.

643
00:28:08,369 --> 00:28:09,930
Honestly, this is probably

644
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,599
a new business opportunity. I suspect it needs to be

645
00:28:13,989 --> 00:28:16,969
or not needs to be, but I suspect it will be much better

646
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:19,989
and more effective if it's cooked into the

647
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,060
underlying platforms like gith Lab and github.

648
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,170
And it's just

649
00:28:23,329 --> 00:28:24,569
there as a thing. And

650
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,510
again,

651
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,819
Github's a company and not only a company, but it's been acquired by Microsoft.

652
00:28:28,829 --> 00:28:30,869
So they have a little bit of money behind them. And

653
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:31,930
I would

654
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:33,760
like to think that Microsoft,

655
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:36,530
they keep saying that, you know, we're open source friendly, blah, blah, blah,

656
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,359
we've changed no more Halloween memos,

657
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,930
no more cancer,

658
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,430
you know, of open source.

659
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:42,089
And

660
00:28:42,689 --> 00:28:44,729
I think it's on Microsoft to do some of the work here.

661
00:28:45,069 --> 00:28:47,270
If they want people to continue to trust github,

662
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,420
right? Because right now github

663
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,109
is in a fair, it's a golden era of trust, right? Everything is in github.

664
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,560
No. And, and I mean, this is part of my point, right? Like let's say Git

665
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:59,589
lab starts incorporating all this stuff. I think that is,

666
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,880
that is a differentiator. Now, if github

667
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,969
isn't doing it and Git Lab is doing it,

668
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:05,630
you could, you know what I mean?

669
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,010
That, that,

670
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,160
that gives us an incentive to do more open

671
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:09,859
source with Git lab or if there's some other,

672
00:29:09,869 --> 00:29:11,189
I know there's other hosting

673
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,420
or source control whatever we call, get up and get lab. You know what I mean?

674
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:20,180
I, I feel like there's a huge opportunity here and I think part of it too is also

675
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,819
what do people expect and want and what are providers actually doing and,

676
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:26,280
and that speaks to, you know, the, the,

677
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:28,739
like the Linux Foundation badges program and stuff because

678
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:31,729
for example, has this repo

679
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,030
scan for viruses?

680
00:29:33,349 --> 00:29:34,810
Well, I have no idea.

681
00:29:35,709 --> 00:29:36,040
Right.

682
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,030
Does this repo

683
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,260
enforce two fa for the developers?

684
00:29:39,589 --> 00:29:43,459
I have no idea. And there's no way you can tell for the most part

685
00:29:43,719 --> 00:29:47,060
without having some sort of external source.

686
00:29:47,229 --> 00:29:50,900
Verify. I mean, it's kind of the same thing with compliance. Right. Where

687
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:55,609
I know you and I have talked at length in private about like sock two compliance where

688
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,170
it's one of those things getting, it isn't particularly difficult.

689
00:29:59,479 --> 00:30:02,957
It says a lot if you can, you have to get it. You know what I mean?

690
00:30:03,366 --> 00:30:04,616
It's one of those, like

691
00:30:04,947 --> 00:30:08,636
you wash your hands after you use the toilet sort of things.

692
00:30:08,967 --> 00:30:09,207
Oh, yeah.

693
00:30:09,217 --> 00:30:09,516
No, I,

694
00:30:09,526 --> 00:30:11,977
I just found out one of my favorite restaurants in

695
00:30:11,987 --> 00:30:13,947
a small town is completely anti vax and it's like,

696
00:30:13,957 --> 00:30:16,197
well, I can never go there again because they don't follow health code.

697
00:30:16,207 --> 00:30:16,776
So

698
00:30:17,406 --> 00:30:19,256
that sucks because they had really good hot dogs.

699
00:30:19,386 --> 00:30:21,006
And what else are you doing? You know,

700
00:30:21,136 --> 00:30:21,717
I mean,

701
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:22,957
that's the question

702
00:30:23,217 --> 00:30:24,437
and, and I think,

703
00:30:24,626 --> 00:30:27,036
yeah, and maybe, maybe the scorecard

704
00:30:27,433 --> 00:30:28,093
is

705
00:30:28,413 --> 00:30:30,333
the first step in the right direction, I guess.

706
00:30:30,343 --> 00:30:32,963
So, the problem again, the scorecard comes back to is ok.

707
00:30:32,973 --> 00:30:36,854
So we're scoring open source and if they want to take the next step, how,

708
00:30:36,864 --> 00:30:40,173
how like who's doing the work, how is it being paid for, what's going on, you know,

709
00:30:40,183 --> 00:30:41,173
and that's why I think it,

710
00:30:41,183 --> 00:30:44,534
it really the best bang for the buck will come in when like github

711
00:30:45,104 --> 00:30:48,254
does this and just, it's a switch that you either.

712
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:52,484
Well, ideally have to opt out of if it's actually better security and not, you know,

713
00:30:52,494 --> 00:30:57,051
a privacy issue or whatever or has like a relatively easy opt in switch.

714
00:30:57,061 --> 00:30:58,791
And that's just it, maybe it'll be github,

715
00:30:58,931 --> 00:31:01,831
maybe it'll be someone else. I don't know the answer, but I do think you're right.

716
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,500
I think

717
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,750
somehow

718
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,740
we need an easy button

719
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:09,500
to, you know, steal the trope where it's basically like

720
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,980
secure my project. Click. There we go. We're all set everybody.

721
00:31:14,201 --> 00:31:14,711
Well,

722
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,791
you know, if you go into github,

723
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:18,110
I, I don't think there's a dashboard.

724
00:31:18,321 --> 00:31:19,071
Ok.

725
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,040
Better example,

726
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:23,849
Wordpress has a security dashboard built into it now since quite a while.

727
00:31:23,939 --> 00:31:24,689
And for example,

728
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:28,310
mine keeps nagging me to upgrade my version of PHP because I'm running on a Buntu 18

729
00:31:28,609 --> 00:31:29,829
LTs. So it's like,

730
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:30,569
you know,

731
00:31:30,699 --> 00:31:33,089
technically it's out of date, but it's back port of patches,

732
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,250
but the security dashboard in wordpress

733
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:39,349
is great because it's like, here's a bunch of stuff that's wrong.

734
00:31:39,469 --> 00:31:41,729
Click here to fix it and it like takes you to the

735
00:31:41,739 --> 00:31:43,930
plug in screen where it's like here's a punch out outdated plugins,

736
00:31:43,939 --> 00:31:47,689
hit that update button or you know, you need to upgrade PHP

737
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:48,839
like a

738
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:51,020
get update PHP or you know,

739
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:55,130
it actually has either actionable advice or a link to directly.

740
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,410
Like click here, click here, click that to enable this.

741
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:58,709
And so github

742
00:31:58,819 --> 00:32:01,930
for example, could have a thing where like it could have an egg screen saying, hey,

743
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:05,300
you know, you don't enforce two fa on your organization or projects,

744
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:09,119
please do or you know, click here to ignore because you just don't want to.

745
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:09,680
Again,

746
00:32:09,689 --> 00:32:11,239
I think a lot of people just don't think of it

747
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,939
or they just don't get around to it because you know,

748
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:16,920
do you want your project fixing bugs or turning on two of a?

749
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,920
No, I, I agree and that's just my point, right?

750
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:24,560
Like no developers want to develop, they don't want to manage all this crap. So

751
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,969
I don't know the answer

752
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:26,329
to

753
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:27,880
all this crap. They would not be in github.

754
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,339
Yeah, that's true. That's

755
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:29,569
true.

756
00:32:29,869 --> 00:32:33,060
All right. I need to call this one. I again,

757
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:35,650
I guess more questions and answers.

758
00:32:35,849 --> 00:32:36,750
But it's

759
00:32:37,089 --> 00:32:40,859
if, if someone listening has the answer, let us know.

760
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:46,400
I think part of this feedback loops and capturing those desires and wants and

761
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,319
you know,

762
00:32:48,329 --> 00:32:52,599
I would actually love to see from 100 developers like why haven't you

763
00:32:52,609 --> 00:32:54,780
enabled tu of a and I suspect 20% of them would be like,

764
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:55,260
oh, shoot.

765
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:58,400
Yeah, I should do that. Click, click can be done in five minutes. Maybe. I don't know.

766
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,719
I don't know. All right, calling it. Thank you, Kurt.
