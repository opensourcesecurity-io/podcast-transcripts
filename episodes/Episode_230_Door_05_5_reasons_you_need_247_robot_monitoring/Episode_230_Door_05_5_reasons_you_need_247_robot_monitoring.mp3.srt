Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast. Door number five.

1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,170
-- It is store number five.
-- So five reasons. You don't need 24 7 monitoring.

2
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:09,119
You don't, you,

3
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:11,199
you just said you don't.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,270
Well,

5
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:13,579
ok, you know what?

6
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:15,039
-- No,
-- you do need you need,

7
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:15,729
you know

8
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:16,649
what,

9
00:00:17,209 --> 00:00:18,440
at a metal level, I would argue.

10
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,819
You don't need 59,

11
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:23,459
24 7 monitoring because the system should automatically react to

12
00:00:23,469 --> 00:00:25,670
it because even if you have 24 7 monitoring,

13
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,299
humans are slow.

14
00:00:27,309 --> 00:00:29,469
Well, humans shouldn't be the ones doing the monitoring.

15
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,379
You should have a robot doing the monitoring.

16
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,680
Uh So, ok, five reasons. You need 24 7 robot monitoring.

17
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:38,360
And obviously door number one is like like Attackers don't

18
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:40,680
sleep and they come from different weird time zones.

19
00:00:40,689 --> 00:00:42,549
Wait, how many door? Wait, we just opened door.

20
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,069
Number one, door, number one was like nonsensical stream of consciousness.

21
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,479
So anyways uh Attackers don't 9 to 5.

22
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,759
My favorite example of this is being the Swiss Air Force.

23
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,610
Remember they had that uh passenger jet crash but

24
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:56,840
they couldn't get any Swiss Air Force up because

25
00:00:57,459 --> 00:00:58,549
what was the weekend?

26
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,080
I do not remember that.

27
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,520
But you will, you will give me the link and I'll put it in the show notes.

28
00:01:05,419 --> 00:01:08,760
-- All right. So what are the five reasons?
-- Uh No, that was the only reason I had.

29
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:12,389
I thought we were going to debate it real quick. Um My, my other thought is like,

30
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,870
I don't like monitoring in the sense of

31
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,550
monitoring implies a reactive thing where something has gone

32
00:01:18,559 --> 00:01:21,989
wrong and I need to then detect something has gone wrong and to go deal with it,

33
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,110
I would rather prevent the thing from going wrong in the

34
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,309
first place and just not have to deal with it.

35
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:29,709
Prevention doesn't work. So like for example,

36
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,860
user logging in correctly, no, you know what,

37
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,470
just make people use a password and multifactors authentication.

38
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:37,830
So that either they've kidnapped my person in which case,

39
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:41,059
whatever game over they win or it's actually them. Ok.

40
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:45,349
So I have a better example for this I think is so obviously,

41
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,819
I'm surrounded by monitoring stuff all day because obviously elastic search,

42
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:54,000
this is one things that it does and you deploy all this monitoring infrastructure

43
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,919
and then you obviously start collecting logs and everything.

44
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:01,080
And obviously you end up with problems like alert fatigue, you can log too much,

45
00:02:01,089 --> 00:02:03,639
you can log too little, there's like a million problems.

46
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,680
But the point is when you do this right,

47
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:08,110
you have the ability to

48
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,639
essentially have a beautiful forensic trail you can use to

49
00:02:12,649 --> 00:02:14,949
-- figure out what actually happened
-- and that's the thing.

50
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,690
There's a big difference between detection and prevention and

51
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:20,529
forensics because by the time you're doing forensics,

52
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:22,710
oh, we're looking at the black box and everybody's dead.

53
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,149
-- It's a bit late.
-- Well, and look, prevention can stop.

54
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,110
We'll say the most trivial of things.

55
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,949
Yeah. But prevention is never going to be 100%.

56
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,669
But you know what,

57
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:34,639
when you have good monitoring in place you can be close

58
00:02:34,649 --> 00:02:38,750
to 100% of good monitoring data that you can then use

59
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:41,580
to figure out what say an attacker did or why your

60
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:44,990
infrastructure fell over or why the website is running slow or,

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,050
and step number two is then engineering that away like an airline crash, right?

62
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:52,350
You look at why the airline crash or the airplane crash and you fix it,

63
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,949
the same problem should never happen twice.

64
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,639
And if it does, you have failed,

65
00:02:56,804 --> 00:02:57,285
you say that.

66
00:02:57,294 --> 00:02:58,255
But again, there was that like,

67
00:02:58,264 --> 00:03:01,744
what was it DC elevens with the cargo door that kept blowing out and like,

68
00:03:01,755 --> 00:03:05,625
literally the, their, the air crash investigator was like,

69
00:03:05,755 --> 00:03:07,904
we've seen this before. Oh, it's the exact same thing.

70
00:03:07,914 --> 00:03:08,184
Oh, wait,

71
00:03:08,195 --> 00:03:10,945
what do you mean they didn't implement our recommendations from the first crash?

72
00:03:11,535 --> 00:03:12,464
Yeah, exactly.

73
00:03:12,475 --> 00:03:15,945
The guy, like, it's, it's tragic because he's just like we, we figured this out,

74
00:03:15,955 --> 00:03:18,585
we gave these recommendations and they were ignored.

75
00:03:18,595 --> 00:03:20,985
That is unfortunate for sure. Yeah.

76
00:03:20,994 --> 00:03:25,065
Well, I mean, but, you know, it, life's complicated. Stuff costs money to fix.

77
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:26,789
Right. It, it does.

78
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,270
And it depends how bad the problem is and what's going and there's a million things.

79
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:33,050
-- Right. It's, it's always difficult.
-- Sorry.

80
00:03:33,059 --> 00:03:36,449
Uh, DC 10, the DC 10 had a cargo door that would just sort of like,

81
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,910
-- blow out once in a while until they fixed
-- it.

82
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:41,949
I have a suspicion. Very few people know the difference.

83
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:42,410
Fair

84
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,710
enough. I have no idea. Anyway. Anyway.

85
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,559
Right. Ok. So anyway, the point is

86
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:51,619
monitoring is marvelous. But you also can't have humans looking at your data.

87
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,570
Humans should only look when something horrible is going wrong.

88
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,669
And this is why you should have essentially robots

89
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:58,830
doing all of the work and you should have rules

90
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,889
set up saying these are the things we're going

91
00:04:00,899 --> 00:04:03,309
to care about and when the bad thing happens,

92
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,270
then the human can show up and be like, oh,

93
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:10,809
the robot and it's run amok or the human can say something very bad is going on.

94
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,729
I'm gonna, I'm gonna disagree with you.

95
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,809
The humans should be involved when something new happens,

96
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,540
the same thing should never happen twice.

97
00:04:17,869 --> 00:04:20,928
So the humans should be involved when something new happens and then they

98
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,809
-- figure it out and engineer around it and that's it.
-- Right. Well, exactly.

99
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,559
That's the idea.

100
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,209
Cool. I like it.

101
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,059
All right. I got to figure out what, what day is next six,

102
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,529
we will see you all on December 6th.
