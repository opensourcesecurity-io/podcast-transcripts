Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast.

1
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,039
Episode 142 with myself Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:12,930
Josh Pressers.

3
00:00:13,239 --> 00:00:16,149
Kurt. My long nightmare is finally over.

4
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:16,879
Oh,

5
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:17,309
yeah.

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,500
Yeah, I got rid of the Mac. I had for work and II,

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:21,379
I have a,

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,989
you were holding it wrong.

9
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:25,809
Uh Yeah, I must have been, I must have been. No, I, I have a Linux

10
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:30,739
laptop now that, that I'm also using as my desktop and it is, it is heavenly

11
00:00:30,979 --> 00:00:34,770
-- when something goes wrong. I know what to do. I, I'm loving it. I'm
-- curious.

12
00:00:34,779 --> 00:00:37,599
Did you go with like one of those Linux laptops or did

13
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,650
you just get like a generic Lenovo think pad or whatever?

14
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:40,810
And

15
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:44,650
-- a Lenovo X one carbon. And the reason I got that is,
-- oh,

16
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:45,729
those are nice

17
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,919
but they're, they're very nice machines.

18
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,409
But also given my history, I used to work at Red Hat.

19
00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:53,479
I know most of the Red Hat devs also have

20
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,819
these laptops so they basically just work and in fact,

21
00:00:56,979 --> 00:00:59,299
I can close the lid and it goes to sleep.

22
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,709
I open the lid, it wakes up, you know, things don't just crash for no reason.

23
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,138
But now here's the really crazy thing about it

24
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:09,230
as part of my like Mac package I received,

25
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:12,410
I got the LG five K monitor

26
00:01:12,669 --> 00:01:17,779
and it freaking works, man. Like I plugged it into the, the thinkpad and it works.

27
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,440
It only runs at four K which whatever I can forgive that.

28
00:01:20,449 --> 00:01:23,459
But the fact that the thing works at all like blew my mind.

29
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:25,620
That's a lot of pixels for a laptop to drive.

30
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:26,379
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

31
00:01:26,389 --> 00:01:30,489
And in fact when I turn on, like, screen sharing and stuff, it, uh you know,

32
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,339
you've done it when, when that happens, but that's OK.

33
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:36,139
It all just works and it's using Wayland.

34
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,559
So, like the high DP I works the way it's supposed to work and

35
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,309
it's like, I don't even know what to say. It took me.

36
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:44,430
So I, I got the machine and I figured, all right,

37
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,040
I'll spend the next week setting this up and like,

38
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,430
four hours later I was working off of it and I thought what,

39
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,879
what has happened to the world?

40
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,629
So, what distribution are you running though?

41
00:01:52,089 --> 00:01:53,050
Fedora? 29?

42
00:01:54,029 --> 00:01:54,250
Oh,

43
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,099
ok.

44
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,699
Yeah, it's, well, I, I know it really well,

45
00:01:57,709 --> 00:02:03,360
I know the Fedora devs are using the thinkpad and in fact, there's uh here at Elastic,

46
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,910
we have a whole bunch of Fedora users so I can, you know,

47
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:09,089
use them as a crutch when necessary if I have a problem or,

48
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,860
or I guess I can help them whichever.

49
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,320
So, no, I'm, I'm loving it though.

50
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,449
It's, I would have to say my,

51
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,660
my main complaint with Fedora was always the OS updates because you only get,

52
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:17,199
you know, what is it?

53
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,419
12 months of support. But the fed up the Fedora update thing is

54
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:24,940
mostly the few times I've used it. It, well, I didn't notice any breakage.

55
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:29,479
It's been pretty good lately. And in fact, so I had a Myth TV.

56
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,880
Well, I have a myth TV machine

57
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:37,149
that was running like Fedora 19 and I upgraded it to probably Fedora 26 or 27.

58
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,669
Kind of in, in one go

59
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,000
and it freaking work

60
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,149
-- in
-- one step. Or did you have to, like, go 19 to 21 to 23 to 25?

61
00:02:44,369 --> 00:02:47,470
I went all the way and it just like, it just,

62
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:50,179
it was crazy. I loved it

63
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,880
because I love that guy that did that. What was it like? Do

64
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,830
1.0 to Windows 10 upgrade?

65
00:02:55,389 --> 00:02:55,649
That was,

66
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,669
I think it, I think it's in one of the shows anyways.

67
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:02,210
So here's speaking of things that should just work.

68
00:03:03,179 --> 00:03:04,369
Here's what I want you to do.

69
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,080
I want you to tell me

70
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,589
how to safely

71
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,949
plug an unknown USB device

72
00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:12,289
into my computer so that I can see what's on it.

73
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,710
Well, right. Don't

74
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:17,130
that's number one.

75
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:20,169
So here's what I would do if, if I had,

76
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:23,509
if someone showed up and said I have this unknown USB

77
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,449
device and I really need to know what's on it.

78
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,389
Can you help me?

79
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:29,229
Yeah. And, but to be clear, let's go all the way paranoid.

80
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,220
Let's assume for a moment, maybe we're with an organization like, oh,

81
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:36,860
I don't know the secret service and maybe we just found somebody

82
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:40,600
who has a pile of USB drives that are interesting looking.

83
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,279
This is a hypothetical, right? This would never happen in real life.

84
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:47,360
-- Hypothetically speaking, any names or places are a coincidence,
-- you know.

85
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,589
So, so let's come up with a safe protocol

86
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:52,320
assuming with the secret service.

87
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,929
So that basically means we are state level and we have access to,

88
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,330
I'm not going to say unlimited resources, but we have access to a lot of things.

89
00:03:58,449 --> 00:03:58,839
So,

90
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,240
so what should we or what do we need to do to safely

91
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,630
plug a USB drive to a laptop to see what is on it?

92
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,190
So in the case of an organization like the secret service, they,

93
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,070
they should have a forensics lab somewhere that you would bring it to and they have

94
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:13,970
various, we'll say tools at their disposal,

95
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:18,970
things like you could image the USB device in a manner that would be non destructive,

96
00:04:19,928 --> 00:04:20,649
wrong answer.

97
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,440
What if it explodes

98
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,670
it could, I mean, I don't know what their labs look like,

99
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:29,660
but I'm sure they have the ability to like x ray it and figure out what's going on.

100
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:32,940
So I think we agree, the first step is probably to X ray that sucker

101
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,230
potentially.

102
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:35,380
And I would point out

103
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,709
number one, it might explode or number two, it might be a USB kill device.

104
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,739
It's certainly possible.

105
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,190
I mean, you never know, but again,

106
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,049
like when they plug it in it's going to be plugged into

107
00:04:45,059 --> 00:04:48,230
what is essentially burner gear that if it does ruin it.

108
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:48,989
-- Oh,
-- well,

109
00:04:49,109 --> 00:04:50,809
I agree. So, so I think we'll agree.

110
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,220
Number one,

111
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:54,589
you need to X ray this thing and make sure it doesn't contain explosives or, you know,

112
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,390
back up.

113
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,309
So those of you that may maybe don't know or don't remember USB K

114
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,230
is a USB stick that essentially has capacitors

115
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,190
and discharges. Well, it doesn't actually discharge electricity.

116
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,570
It discharges like negative 200 volts through the USB

117
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,079
repeatedly and

118
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:12,649
like

119
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:15,299
just kills the computer like super fast and

120
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,390
you can buy these at USB kill.com

121
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:20,130
and they even make it anonymized version without the logo on it

122
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:24,130
and they're not that expensive. Oh, and they also have swift and discreet shipping.

123
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:26,750
Yeah, I love it.

124
00:05:27,049 --> 00:05:27,600
So,

125
00:05:28,179 --> 00:05:28,329
yeah,

126
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:30,109
you need to X ray this thing first and just make

127
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:32,670
sure it isn't physically gonna like explode on you or,

128
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:33,989
or blow up your gear.

129
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,880
They can do this. We can't,

130
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,380
I don't have access to an X ray.

131
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,920
-- We
-- could pry it apart, I suppose and hopefully not damage it.

132
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,420
I mean, maybe, but if you're dealing with an explosive device.

133
00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:49,760
So if an explosive device is one of your legitimate concerns,

134
00:05:49,769 --> 00:05:52,250
which honestly it wouldn't be for me most likely.

135
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,190
But if it was even opening it could potentially set

136
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,510
off explosives depending upon what they used inside of it.

137
00:05:58,829 --> 00:05:58,899
Yeah.

138
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:02,140
Yeah. If they used a switch or something light sensitive or whatever.

139
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:07,470
No, not even that. Just the fact is most explosives are highly unstable.

140
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,410
Put it in a Ziploc

141
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:08,769
bag

142
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:12,549
and rig a hammer up to like, fall on it

143
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,329
and like have a string, pull the string, the hammer falls and whack it.

144
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,489
No, look, no, if this is a legitimate concern, you have like,

145
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,290
just throw it in the freaking river.

146
00:06:21,429 --> 00:06:23,630
Just don't, don't, don't touch it

147
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,950
-- or take it to the cops.
-- Sure. Sure. Right.

148
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:27,829
Don't.

149
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,209
And, and

150
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,480
why are you asking me this? Like, it's not gonna explode?

151
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:38,649
Yeah. So, well, ok, let's get past that. So now we've got a device that is physically

152
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,910
safe to plug it in the sense of it's not

153
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,609
going to physically harm us or the physical hardware.

154
00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:44,660
Ok. Ok.

155
00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:49,260
What, what, let me put it this way. What kind of burner device would you plug it into?

156
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,890
I would use a chromebook myself because they're fairly

157
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:54,459
inexpensive and I won't say they're hacker proof,

158
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,820
but I think they're not a target of most of this sort of problem.

159
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,420
Yeah, I would, I would go even,

160
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,760
I get something like a Raspberry nano

161
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,970
running

162
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:06,260
very running a very minimal Linux that you plug in

163
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:09,600
because part of it too is you can have an SD card

164
00:07:09,609 --> 00:07:12,250
in there that you can then pull and easily forensically examine.

165
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:13,079
Right.

166
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:14,690
Sure. Sure.

167
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,679
And they're, they're the little ras,

168
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,880
so Raspberry pi and I don't think they're called Nanos.

169
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:20,970
Uh I forget the name of them.

170
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:25,239
-- They make a Raspberry Zero. I think that's the one I meant to say. Yeah.
-- Zero.

171
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:29,290
That's it. Zero. Nano is Arduino's but it's like fire box.

172
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,329
It's super cheap.

173
00:07:30,619 --> 00:07:30,739
Yeah,

174
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,472
so you could plug one device in and then literally throw it away when you're done.

175
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:35,553
Right. Right.

176
00:07:35,653 --> 00:07:38,893
And or just throw the SD card away because,

177
00:07:38,993 --> 00:07:42,993
well, no, because for example, they could infect the USB chip set

178
00:07:43,203 --> 00:07:46,403
or they could infect the CPU or they could. No, these are

179
00:07:46,662 --> 00:07:48,352
there's exploit code for these floating around.

180
00:07:48,532 --> 00:07:53,632
This is not in my threat model. Nor will I allow it to be. Let's just say that

181
00:07:53,782 --> 00:07:55,803
I, I would generally agree because that way man

182
00:07:55,993 --> 00:07:56,333
flies,

183
00:07:57,835 --> 00:08:00,786
what happens when this stuff shows up on github, which it has

184
00:08:00,976 --> 00:08:02,415
and people actually start using it.

185
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:07,925
-- I
-- mean, if, if it becomes a well known problem and let's face it,

186
00:08:07,936 --> 00:08:12,915
it's going to show up in the, the typical places we watch for news and events,

187
00:08:12,985 --> 00:08:15,656
then I would potentially change my mind.

188
00:08:15,665 --> 00:08:17,726
But as of today right now,

189
00:08:17,735 --> 00:08:23,295
I would not be concerned with a device infecting chip sets on a raspberry pie

190
00:08:23,739 --> 00:08:27,609
and that's, I, I'm going to presume it's possible. I don't know, for sure.

191
00:08:27,619 --> 00:08:30,170
-- I don't understand the hardware that terribly
-- well,

192
00:08:30,179 --> 00:08:33,210
part of the problem is computers used to be a computer.

193
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:33,890
So, like

194
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:34,140
RC

195
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,020
and nowadays computers are

196
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,169
like, literally every chip is.

197
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,849
-- Yeah,
-- everything's a computer. Exactly. Exactly.

198
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,450
Yeah. Like your network card.

199
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:47,700
It, it has a, it's capable of doing computation, your video card.

200
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:50,080
Absolutely. That's kind of the whole point nowadays.

201
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,479
That's what you got to mine, your Cryptocurrency on, right.

202
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,609
You know, your USB slots.

203
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:55,039
Yeah, I mean, I,

204
00:08:55,049 --> 00:08:59,539
I remember I had an Asus motherboard that had a built in hardware level firewall.

205
00:08:59,549 --> 00:09:02,090
So that, and you could configure it to

206
00:09:02,729 --> 00:09:04,700
block and allow network traffic. So,

207
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,659
you know, before it even got to the US.

208
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,030
That's pretty cool. All right. Anyway, we're whatever. All right.

209
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,289
So we have a device,

210
00:09:12,489 --> 00:09:13,809
we need to plug it in.

211
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,250
You would use a Raspberry Pie Nano. I would use my chromebook.

212
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,409
And what now,

213
00:09:19,979 --> 00:09:20,840
well, how do you,

214
00:09:20,849 --> 00:09:23,010
how do you image it and actually know that you're getting

215
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,359
everything off of it because it could lie about its size.

216
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,229
It totally could. And a chromebook actually isn't good at that.

217
00:09:28,239 --> 00:09:32,390
That's where the Raspberry Pi, you could totally do like ad D type operation,

218
00:09:32,869 --> 00:09:33,599
assuming

219
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:38,539
it's a disk and assuming, like you said, it's not lying about what it really is.

220
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,590
You see, my, my one thought would be is if it,

221
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,390
if it was designed to say, only be plugged into a Windows machine.

222
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,130
Like, oh, I don't know, like, apparently that's what that secret service guy did.

223
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,530
Hypothetically speaking.

224
00:09:48,739 --> 00:09:49,010
Yeah.

225
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,109
Hypothetically speaking, if you just like, plugged it into your Windows laptop,

226
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:56,570
it could run software that could then, you know,

227
00:09:56,739 --> 00:09:58,289
essentially uh

228
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,250
unlock further information on the device because there's,

229
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,719
there's ways to format and partition a USB drive

230
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,489
and even in and to put hardware into it, you know, there's,

231
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,400
there's those encrypted USB drives, for example,

232
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,770
that actually have like a physical keypad

233
00:10:12,229 --> 00:10:16,059
on the USB drive, like a little 10 digit numeric keypad on the key drive

234
00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:19,580
that you have to punch in the number for it to like unlock itself,

235
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,460
right?

236
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,349
And most of them suck. I think Schneier

237
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,969
wrote about a lot of these where the

238
00:10:23,979 --> 00:10:26,940
vast majority of them were absolutely horrendous.

239
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:31,049
-- Well, of course, there are, what else would they be?
-- Yeah. OK. So here's,

240
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,890
I've been thinking about this actually and I,

241
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,080
I did not know you're going to start the show with this particular hypothetical,

242
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,830
which amuses me, I will say.

243
00:10:38,229 --> 00:10:41,260
But here's my breakdown of this problem is

244
00:10:41,369 --> 00:10:45,099
if a normal person finds a USB device somewhere,

245
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,500
it is highly likely they will just plug it into whatever they have.

246
00:10:49,869 --> 00:10:53,559
Now, let's say you have an organization like the secret service

247
00:10:53,739 --> 00:10:56,909
or let's say the FBI or the Department of Defense,

248
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,809
you would expect many of those people to know better. But they don't

249
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:05,280
because if you've ever been to, uh, basically a highly secure data center,

250
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:08,219
what do they do to the USB ports in those places?

251
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:09,890
I know in some places they,

252
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:13,580
they glue them shut everywhere. Why did glue them shut?

253
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,400
Because people plug cramp in that they aren't supposed to,

254
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:19,440
even when they know better.

255
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:24,809
And you got to think like these dod people that are operating in a skiff, they know

256
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,179
they know not to do this and they still do.

257
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:30,869
Yeah. Well, ok, two things. Number one, what's a skiff?

258
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,270
-- Because not everybody knows this. Oh, sorry.
-- It's, I, I don't remember the acronym.

259
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,520
It's basically just a highly secured data center.

260
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,640
Well, it's a secure compartmentalized information something.

261
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:43,989
And it's essentially typically it's a tempest shielded room or area

262
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,609
anywhere from the size of like a closet where you can have, you know,

263
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:49,849
a private conversation with somebody to things, the size of football fields,

264
00:11:49,859 --> 00:11:50,789
holding data centers.

265
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:54,460
And the idea is like, I, I've dealt with people where they literally are, like,

266
00:11:54,469 --> 00:11:56,719
I'm outside in the parking lot in my car making this phone

267
00:11:56,729 --> 00:11:58,979
call because I'm not allowed to bring my phone into the facility.

268
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,979
Right. Right. And I've, I've been to, I've been to meetings like that.

269
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:03,340
It's always, it always amuses me.

270
00:12:03,349 --> 00:12:06,219
It's like, put your phone in this, this locker, we'll give it back to you later.

271
00:12:06,229 --> 00:12:08,799
It's like you're going to mess with it and then they just look at you funny.

272
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:10,020
And they, they never answer.

273
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,729
-- So,
-- yeah, I had that, that situation with, uh,

274
00:12:12,739 --> 00:12:14,780
with some meetings that were supposed to happen on the campus.

275
00:12:14,789 --> 00:12:15,539
And they were

276
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,770
number one when they found out I was not American and I was Canadian.

277
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,450
They're like, oh,

278
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:20,580
awkward,

279
00:12:20,969 --> 00:12:22,770
followed by like, and, and I was,

280
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:26,640
I was quite clear that I was not giving up my phone because I can't,

281
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,820
I just won't and I won't.

282
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,080
But

283
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,369
anyways moving along.

284
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:30,460
So, ok,

285
00:12:30,469 --> 00:12:33,299
we've got this thing physically plugged in it may or may not have attacked

286
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:35,520
our USB chip set and we may or may not be aware of that.

287
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,960
So I would say the number one thing now is if you really want to do it safely,

288
00:12:39,169 --> 00:12:45,429
you need some USB level hardware like kind of the reverse of a USB Power condom.

289
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,309
So a USB power condom is a thing that

290
00:12:47,609 --> 00:12:49,299
essentially it's a little pass through

291
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:52,429
USB device that only allows electricity through

292
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,669
data

293
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,229
so that you can now plug your phone into charge.

294
00:12:56,429 --> 00:13:00,940
-- They rename them because the USB condom was the worst name in the world
-- did.

295
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:04,159
-- It kept getting blocked by parental controls.
-- It might have, I don't know.

296
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:04,559
I always,

297
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:07,549
I always felt bad telling like what is this when you're at a conference giving?

298
00:13:07,609 --> 00:13:10,260
It's like, oh it's a USB condom and then they just look at you. It's like, oh

299
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:11,400
black

300
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:11,739
Day.

301
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,280
Anyway,

302
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:16,070
they're called sink stops now and they come with a nice case and stuff and it's,

303
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,799
it's not like the good old days when it was just like a, a

304
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,369
board of Bear electronics.

305
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,229
No, they're, they're nice. They're nice.

306
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:26,429
But here's, here's the other part of that though.

307
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,200
I used to travel with one all the time and I don't anymore. You know why?

308
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,789
Because I just have a big freaking battery in my backpack.

309
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:34,140
It's,

310
00:13:34,409 --> 00:13:37,109
that's the solution anyway. Anyway.

311
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,719
Ok. So

312
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,309
I guess here's the thing.

313
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:43,150
If you plug it in and it starts doing stuff,

314
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,659
you've lost all your gears compromised

315
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:46,229
you.

316
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:49,349
If you're, if you're an organization with resources,

317
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:52,830
you're going to just turn it all into the lab and say, I don't know what's happening

318
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:54,270
if you're, you or me,

319
00:13:54,489 --> 00:13:56,450
uh, you're going to throw it away and if you're a normal person,

320
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,989
you probably won't even know anything happened.

321
00:13:58,239 --> 00:13:58,609
That's

322
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,719
if it's chromebook, they power wash it or if it's, you know, really bad,

323
00:14:03,729 --> 00:14:06,059
they maybe get it formatted and reinstalled.

324
00:14:06,099 --> 00:14:09,169
Uh, right. Actually, I would sell my hacked chromebook on

325
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,359
ebay. Probably.

326
00:14:10,619 --> 00:14:12,380
Well, I'm not going to use it anymore.

327
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:15,359
I'll just power wash it to pretend it's fine. Right.

328
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:15,950
Yeah,

329
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,559
I wonder that sometimes how much of the gear,

330
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,400
unlike ebay was because it was horribly infected.

331
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:23,440
Nobody wants to use it anymore.

332
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:26,479
Oh, I've heard some stories of people buying things and just getting.

333
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:27,789
Yeah, that's, it's,

334
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,440
-- yeah, some of this gear has definitely been compromised and I have
-- no

335
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:31,960
doubt,

336
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:32,760
you know,

337
00:14:33,219 --> 00:14:35,020
stock or software or whatever.

338
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,989
Right. Right. So, anyway,

339
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:42,359
-- so
-- I'll be blunt, I think what this boils down to is unless you have access to

340
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:46,309
or you're willing to have the discipline to have like Bernard Gear

341
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,390
that's running Linux and, and, you know,

342
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,289
really image it and then look at what it is and see here's the problem.

343
00:14:51,409 --> 00:14:55,270
So now you've imaged what's on this USB drive, you've got a nice little DD, you know,

344
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,719
output into a file.

345
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,710
What do you do with it?

346
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,190
Right. Who has the software to forensically examine it

347
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:04,479
-- and then understand what that output is?
-- Well, I don't, I don't have the skills even.

348
00:15:04,489 --> 00:15:06,549
So this topic actually came up.

349
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:06,909
It,

350
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:08,770
it's popped up about four or five times for

351
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:12,349
me in the last probably two months about digital forensics

352
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,030
and, and here's the thing. So I, I know there's certain things I could do,

353
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:19,359
but it would be an amusement at best.

354
00:15:19,369 --> 00:15:23,239
I don't have the skill set or the tools to do proper digital forensics.

355
00:15:23,469 --> 00:15:26,799
But here's the more important thing is when you're an organization

356
00:15:27,049 --> 00:15:29,150
that's part of, say law enforcement or,

357
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,140
or any time you think there could potentially be something

358
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:35,630
like criminal charges involved in what's happening around you.

359
00:15:35,929 --> 00:15:36,349
There's,

360
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:39,400
there's very strict procedures that have to happen around

361
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:41,789
things like the preservation and handling of evidence.

362
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:42,890
And obviously,

363
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,590
when you have say a bad USB drive that's evidence.

364
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,880
And so like, if you plug it into your computer and it does stuff you,

365
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,260
that evidence is now worthless.

366
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,250
You're going to struggle to get that admissible in

367
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,080
court because the defense is going to say,

368
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:58,619
well, you plugged it in and your computer had a virus and infected the flash drive.

369
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,179
Like, well,

370
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,890
it didn't, but I can't prove it didn't because, like,

371
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:05,419
I just smoked my computer plugging in this bad drive.

372
00:16:05,429 --> 00:16:06,119
So,

373
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:06,900
I mean,

374
00:16:06,909 --> 00:16:10,289
that's what makes it so hard when you look at a lot

375
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:13,320
of this stuff is this is such a specific and unique skill set

376
00:16:13,969 --> 00:16:15,219
that, that most of us,

377
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,520
it's kind of the old thing.

378
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:19,460
There, there's, you know, unknown, you know, there's the things, you know,

379
00:16:19,469 --> 00:16:21,000
there's the things, you know, you don't know.

380
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,039
And then there's the things you don't know, you don't know.

381
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:27,650
And digital forensics for the vast majority of us are things we don't know,

382
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:30,869
we don't know, we think we do but we totally don't.

383
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,109
Well,

384
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,520
and I would say it's even more complicated

385
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,390
than that because it varies by jurisdiction.

386
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,599
Yes. Yes, it does. You know what I mean?

387
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,159
So, there's like,

388
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:41,479
there's like the physical rules of the world and then there's the legal frameworks

389
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:42,789
that

390
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,690
you are operating under which

391
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:47,520
it's, and it's not going to be completely different.

392
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,580
But, I mean, I, I'm,

393
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,119
I'm pretty sure there's going to be differences

394
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,669
between where I live in Canada and where you

395
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:56,489
-- live in the U si
-- guarantee there are and I won't even pretend to know my jurisdiction.

396
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,469
I live in what, how those rules work. I mean,

397
00:16:59,609 --> 00:17:01,229
I'm not an expert at this.

398
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:01,880
Well, you actually,

399
00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:02,169
I think

400
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:02,750
you

401
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:05,780
live in multiple jurisdictions technically depending on if

402
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,709
-- it's state or federal or
-- whatever and,

403
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:12,069
and local and it's, the US is wild about a lot of that.

404
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:14,150
I don't, I don't know how other places work.

405
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,069
But, yeah, I mean, you could be charged with federal crimes.

406
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,880
You could be charged at the local level, their state level.

407
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:20,390
It's just, it's,

408
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,010
uh,

409
00:17:21,118 --> 00:17:21,209
I

410
00:17:21,358 --> 00:17:23,410
don't want to think about it, but, but again,

411
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:29,589
I'm not qualified to do any of this work and I know that and if you think you are,

412
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,599
you probably aren't, is my suspicion.

413
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,329
Well, unless you have official certifications and you've taken

414
00:17:38,699 --> 00:17:38,829
at

415
00:17:39,189 --> 00:17:42,260
least a year or five of training.

416
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,140
Absolutely.

417
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:46,390
Yeah, because when I, when I, when I look at digital forensics, all I know is

418
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:48,930
I could do a very limited, like

419
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:52,930
if you accidentally deleted photos on your phone. Yeah, I could definitely help you

420
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,920
and, and my help would consist of Googling for a piece of software to recovery.

421
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:59,869
Right. That's it. Let's be real.

422
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:03,130
Uh, and, and I know enough beyond that, that no, sorry guys.

423
00:18:03,189 --> 00:18:05,130
And, and definitely don't take it to the geek squad.

424
00:18:05,569 --> 00:18:10,479
-- You don't wanna do that.
-- I don't trust any of those places with my gear

425
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:11,449
and

426
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:15,680
it is I, I don't think there's anything wrong with them necessarily.

427
00:18:15,689 --> 00:18:19,290
It's just the fact that if, if, if it's a problem I can't fix,

428
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,209
it's a pretty big problem.

429
00:18:21,229 --> 00:18:24,089
Right. That's kind of the way I, I tend to see these things.

430
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:26,000
So, anyway, I guess here's,

431
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:28,729
here's the question I have for you over all this

432
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:33,250
in our hypothetical scenario where a secret service agent doesn't

433
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,020
know enough not to plug in a USB flash drive.

434
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:36,560
And you

435
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:38,670
almost certainly think they should.

436
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:43,229
-- What hope do the rest of us have and what can we do about it?
-- So, here's the problem.

437
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:46,010
Fundamentally, human curiosity, you find a USB drive,

438
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,849
you're gonna want to be helpful,

439
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,869
plug it in and see who it belongs to and send it back to them.

440
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,849
-- No,
-- you don't, you want to plug it in and see how big it is and then keep it if it's good.

441
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:53,469
Right.

442
00:18:55,109 --> 00:19:00,650
But fundamentally, and I don't want to, you know, come across as mean and harsh, but

443
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,849
don't, I mean, maybe turn it into the police and then it's their problem.

444
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,530
Yeah, they're not going to care either.

445
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:07,839
Let's face it if you show up with a flash drive.

446
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:10,810
-- Well, and
-- they're just gonna plug it into their, their computer and be like,

447
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,969
probably, and see if it's any good and then keep it,

448
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,790
like, what else would they do with it? Right. Send it to the forensics lab.

449
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,510
-- No,
-- because why would they,

450
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,869
you know, to quote the big Lebowski.

451
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,069
Hey, we got, we got four more detectives working on it in shifts.

452
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:29,489
Well, and, and here's the other half of that is in our hypothetical situation,

453
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:34,145
the secret service people were in proximity to the President of the United States

454
00:19:34,155 --> 00:19:38,474
who is a legitimate target for what we would call movie plot threats.

455
00:19:38,704 --> 00:19:42,814
But in the, in the case of, of the president, of probably most countries,

456
00:19:42,824 --> 00:19:44,574
they're not called movie plot threats.

457
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:45,935
They're just called threats.

458
00:19:46,405 --> 00:19:48,295
Well, I would say that's just a Tuesday for them,

459
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,709
right? You don't want to see what Thursday looks like.

460
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:53,760
But I, I mean, it, it,

461
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:57,680
it should be different but it's not because people forget things,

462
00:19:57,689 --> 00:19:59,900
people make silly mistakes and I,

463
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:02,619
I get it. I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna fault.

464
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,589
I, I know the, the secret service people who,

465
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:08,109
who theoretically did this may or may not be catching a lot of heat on Twitter.

466
00:20:08,219 --> 00:20:12,550
But it's like people, people do dumb stuff. It's just how people work.

467
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,069
It's not that they, the problem is, it's not so much that they did something dumb,

468
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:17,589
they did something normal.

469
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:21,400
Yeah, that's true. And the problem is they're not supposed to do normal things.

470
00:20:21,459 --> 00:20:25,180
That is also very true. And that's a very difficult problem to fix.

471
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:29,829
-- It is potentially an impossible problem to fix. Yeah,
-- because humans be human. Yo,

472
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:35,020
-- humans got a human.
-- Now, now here's the question though. Is there anything

473
00:20:35,219 --> 00:20:39,920
that can be done to mitigate against a problem like this for,

474
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,199
we'll say a relatively normal person.

475
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:46,900
So at an organization level, there are things to control access to USB.

476
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:50,900
But obviously that's not going to work for a normal human being, even myself.

477
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,319
Like I'm not going to spend the money. Those things are not cheap.

478
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:58,239
I do know that I could lock down my windows, Apple and Linux devices to not talk to

479
00:20:58,459 --> 00:20:59,880
any USB device

480
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:02,109
other than like what I explicitly allow.

481
00:21:02,449 --> 00:21:02,599
Right.

482
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:04,859
Yeah, I'm not going to bother because honestly

483
00:21:04,969 --> 00:21:08,199
I'm just generally not going to plug random USB stuff into my

484
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:09,199
machines

485
00:21:09,489 --> 00:21:10,439
and funnily enough.

486
00:21:10,449 --> 00:21:14,349
So the way I generally buy my USB devices is I buy them, you know, new,

487
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:15,390
I don't buy you stuff.

488
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,800
I buy new off of like,

489
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:22,050
hopefully, uh, from like, staples or whatever, you know, Amazon

490
00:21:22,339 --> 00:21:23,920
and hopefully I'm not getting something that, you know,

491
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:27,510
previously had a virus installed at the factory or,

492
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:28,199
but that

493
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:28,910
too.

494
00:21:29,449 --> 00:21:31,829
Oh, exactly. Yeah. All those picture frames that, you know,

495
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:34,609
-- constantly for some reason get viruses.
-- Right.

496
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:35,030
Right.

497
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:37,069
Yeah, I basically just, you know,

498
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,810
don't plug in random things and I don't let people plug random things into my stuff.

499
00:21:40,819 --> 00:21:43,160
I don't plug my phone into random charge ports like

500
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,800
this little walker cabinets at the airport or whatever.

501
00:21:45,819 --> 00:21:49,030
Yeah, like you said, the solution there is I just, I, I buy

502
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,829
or? Right, but once every year or two I buy a new battery from Costco.

503
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:53,619
You know,

504
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,520
-- and, and yeah,
-- that's

505
00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:00,180
-- it.
-- Tap the problem, which is, let's say, charging devices.

506
00:22:00,189 --> 00:22:02,060
But what about if people, I mean, look,

507
00:22:02,069 --> 00:22:04,479
if a normal person finds a USB device on the ground,

508
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,880
they're going to plug it in full stop.

509
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:10,000
-- Is there anything they can do about it? And should they even really care
-- generally?

510
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:12,859
-- No, because most people are not the president of the United States.
-- Right?

511
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:16,619
I would argue it, it, you know, I mean, if this is something you worry about,

512
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,160
don't do it because obviously,

513
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:22,040
like, if I find one, no, I do not, I don't even pick it up most of the time.

514
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,180
But if, if

515
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,390
Norman people are going to pick them up and they're

516
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,250
going to plug them in and in all seriousness,

517
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,229
I think in the

518
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:32,550
99.9999% situations, it isn't going to matter.

519
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,189
It's just going to be like some college kids, term paper he lost

520
00:22:35,609 --> 00:22:36,750
-- or
-- photos or whatever.

521
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,760
Right. And

522
00:22:37,949 --> 00:22:40,750
I mean, if you're someone who worries about this and let's face it,

523
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,869
like there are plenty of organizations where you hear

524
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,790
about parking lot attacks and things like that.

525
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,810
This is where you need to rely on technical controls to prevent this.

526
00:22:48,819 --> 00:22:52,760
We're locking USB ports and making sure people can't bring USB drives and plug

527
00:22:52,925 --> 00:22:55,944
into the corporate network if that's something you're actually worried about.

528
00:22:56,265 --> 00:22:59,385
Whereas telling people don't pick up USB drives and plug them in,

529
00:22:59,614 --> 00:23:00,775
I mean, whatever that's like saying,

530
00:23:00,785 --> 00:23:03,734
-- quick clicking on fishing links just it doesn't work
-- well.

531
00:23:03,744 --> 00:23:06,005
And that's part of the problem is you're telling people not to do something,

532
00:23:06,015 --> 00:23:09,324
but you're not giving them an alternative behavior to kind of assuage

533
00:23:09,594 --> 00:23:10,224
what they want.

534
00:23:10,234 --> 00:23:14,135
So, what I would say is, is I wouldn't say, don't pick them up and plug them in.

535
00:23:14,145 --> 00:23:17,385
I would say if you find a USB device, please turn it into

536
00:23:17,614 --> 00:23:19,594
infosec or it,

537
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:21,895
-- and it will deal with it.
-- Right. So,

538
00:23:22,489 --> 00:23:24,199
so you know what the first thing that popped in my head

539
00:23:24,209 --> 00:23:27,829
was what you said about alternative alternatives to the behavior is,

540
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:27,869
oh,

541
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,520
you should give up like Starbucks gift cards or

542
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,270
something if someone turns in a flash drive,

543
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,189
but then

544
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:35,189
you could conceivably go to the office store

545
00:23:35,459 --> 00:23:39,670
and buy the 100 pack of flash drives and just turn one in every couple of weeks.

546
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,910
You're like, oh, I found another one, everybody.

547
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,310
Although,

548
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:45,319
although I guess this is one of those situations also

549
00:23:45,329 --> 00:23:47,750
where after someone turns in the fourth flash drive,

550
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,390
like, you know, they're game in the system.

551
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:49,859
So

552
00:23:50,349 --> 00:23:53,280
I would, I would probably not do that. But no, I think you're absolutely right.

553
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:57,010
And this is something we fail at insecurity often is we just say, well, don't do that.

554
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:00,130
We don't say instead of doing that, you should do this instead.

555
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:04,760
And if you tell people don't do something like that's the best way to do it. Like,

556
00:24:05,089 --> 00:24:07,910
I just think of my kids where you say, oh, don't do that.

557
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,750
And as soon as you turn around, what are they doing? Exactly.

558
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,469
-- The thing you said not to do
-- well or something

559
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,750
right up to the line of that thing.

560
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,609
Yeah. Right.

561
00:24:16,819 --> 00:24:20,910
And then circumventing it somehow. Like, like at the pool, at one pool we go to,

562
00:24:21,099 --> 00:24:24,069
there's, uh, you know, there's the little, the wire with the plastic things on it.

563
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:26,010
What do you call those things? The, the lane markers,

564
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,180
the lane dividers,

565
00:24:27,489 --> 00:24:28,199
lane dividers. I

566
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:28,709
know that's what

567
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,459
I, so everyone's strung across the pool to, to, to, uh, say

568
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:33,949
off the deeper end

569
00:24:34,219 --> 00:24:37,400
and until you can swim a lap by yourself and they

570
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,729
write a happy face on your shoulder with a sharpie.

571
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:40,849
You're not allowed to go

572
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:42,239
into the deep end alone

573
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:44,219
or even with your adult.

574
00:24:44,339 --> 00:24:48,040
-- Right. Because a lot, a lot of adults can't swim. That.
-- That's true.

575
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,170
Actually, that's fair.

576
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:52,810
So, my one son knows that he's not allowed to go past this barrier.

577
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:57,050
And so he will do everything, like holding on to it, getting his body past it,

578
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,530
like flopping over it.

579
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,910
He's still holding on to it.

580
00:25:00,229 --> 00:25:00,449
You know,

581
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:04,239
he knows exactly how far he can push it and what the lifeguards will allow and what,

582
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:04,609
you know,

583
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:05,479
will.

584
00:25:05,739 --> 00:25:06,030
Right.

585
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,459
So, he's, he's tested those limitless boundaries and,

586
00:25:08,469 --> 00:25:11,530
-- and I respect that because that's how we learn
-- So actually this is,

587
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,319
this is a really good comparison you bring up.

588
00:25:14,329 --> 00:25:19,910
So I will, I will relate this back to a, a real life story I have. So

589
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:23,640
I, I grew up swimming a lot. My son is on a swim team.

590
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:26,400
My daughter, I keep trying to get to swim on the swim team, but she won't be,

591
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:28,369
she's an excellent swimmer and she do really well.

592
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,630
And my, my wife swims well enough.

593
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,349
I'm not, you know, she didn't grow up quite in the water like I did,

594
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,130
but she's more than competent.

595
00:25:35,569 --> 00:25:37,920
And I remember the Children have been in swim

596
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:40,790
lessons basically as soon as they could walk,

597
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,510
they were taught how to swim and they're,

598
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,859
they're phenomenal swimmers and we were down by the river one

599
00:25:45,869 --> 00:25:47,469
day and the kids were out playing on the docks,

600
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,670
you know, out in the water and stuff.

601
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,829
And my wife looks at me goes, what if they fall in? I said

602
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:56,099
they swim like that. This is why we taught them how to swim like this is why.

603
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:58,150
Yeah, I, I agree. Exactly.

604
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,729
Yeah, folks, if you have kids, please teach them to swim.

605
00:26:00,739 --> 00:26:02,890
E even if it's just like recovery paddle

606
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:03,459
actually.

607
00:26:03,469 --> 00:26:08,099
Did you know that if you, if you go to MIT, as an undergrad, I guess they have,

608
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:10,660
you have to take a swim class when you're there.

609
00:26:10,949 --> 00:26:13,930
And the reason they do that is studies have shown that parents

610
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:17,300
who know how to swim have like a 80% decrease in,

611
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,780
in child drownings of their Children,

612
00:26:20,069 --> 00:26:23,089
which I totally believe that, you know, unquestionable.

613
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:24,540
Well, you know, if you don't know how to swim,

614
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,290
what are the chances you're going to teach your kids to swim?

615
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,689
And like I said, you don't have to swim.

616
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:31,030
Well, just recovery crawl, keep your head above water. Get to the edge.

617
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,390
If you can't swim and your kid falls in the water.

618
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,229
It's quite likely if you go in after them.

619
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:38,329
Now there's two people, you have to get out of the water instead of one.

620
00:26:39,109 --> 00:26:40,849
And, and that's kind of a problem also.

621
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:45,209
And I think I would, I would relate a lot of this to security in, in the fact that

622
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:49,439
you can tell people don't go, don't go on the dock, right? Don't go by the water.

623
00:26:49,449 --> 00:26:50,520
They still do.

624
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:52,719
And sometimes people fall in and if they,

625
00:26:52,739 --> 00:26:56,319
if they don't have the skills necessary to deal with the situation,

626
00:26:56,329 --> 00:26:56,959
which let's face it.

627
00:26:56,969 --> 00:26:57,900
Sometimes they don't,

628
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,719
you need someone who knows what they're doing because like,

629
00:27:00,729 --> 00:27:04,479
I've taken all of the lifeguard training courses and when someone is drowning,

630
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,609
they act in a very certain way.

631
00:27:06,619 --> 00:27:08,280
And in fact, even recognizing drowning,

632
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:11,020
like in the movies where they're splashing around, going, help, help, help,

633
00:27:12,229 --> 00:27:13,239
that does not happen.

634
00:27:13,349 --> 00:27:14,270
It is drowning.

635
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,859
People act in a very specific way that normal people don't understand.

636
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,209
And like, oh man, this is such a good comparison.

637
00:27:20,219 --> 00:27:22,079
I'm gonna, I'm gonna put more thought into this. But anyway,

638
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,770
the point is if you don't know how to swim and you jump in to help someone,

639
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,020
now there's two problems.

640
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:30,619
But if you do know what to do, you can totally jump in and help out and,

641
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:35,189
and you'll have success and this is very, very similar to security in general is,

642
00:27:35,569 --> 00:27:38,020
I think we see a lot of situations where someone falls in the

643
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,500
water and then someone else jumps in the water and now there's,

644
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,369
you know, and before you know, it,

645
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,319
there's 30 people drowning and the security person shows up and it's like,

646
00:27:44,489 --> 00:27:47,859
what the heck just happened here. I can't say 30 people.

647
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,189
I know.

648
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,880
Well, and like you said, as the security person and I also,

649
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,699
I don't have lifeguard training well, a little bit.

650
00:27:54,709 --> 00:27:56,900
But for example, at the cabin, I have a throw rope.

651
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,339
-- Yeah.
-- Right. Or a pole or whatever like that.

652
00:27:59,349 --> 00:28:03,579
-- That, that is a perfect compensating control for not being a
-- lifeguard.

653
00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:06,180
But the problem is you have to, but you have to know to buy that.

654
00:28:07,089 --> 00:28:10,099
-- Right. And they're not cheap either. It's like 30 bucks.
-- No, they are expensive.

655
00:28:10,109 --> 00:28:13,300
But they're, they last like, freaking forever. That stuff is fantastic.

656
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:16,739
-- It's so, it's such high quality.
-- But again, like, who, who knows?

657
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,219
I've never,

658
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:20,719
but I've never seen anybody else with a throw rope out of the dock at the cabin.

659
00:28:20,729 --> 00:28:25,099
I I believe that, I don't think, but again, normal people, how would they know?

660
00:28:25,109 --> 00:28:28,150
Right. How would they know not to pick up the USB Drive?

661
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,790
How would they know to get a throw rope?

662
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,540
How would they know how to find someone that could help them if they fall in the water?

663
00:28:34,199 --> 00:28:37,859
And, and I don't, I don't know if there's even a good answer to some of that.

664
00:28:37,869 --> 00:28:38,060
I mean,

665
00:28:38,069 --> 00:28:39,510
some of it's awareness you always hear about

666
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,300
water safety training and things like that.

667
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:46,140
I keep coming back to, especially with the USB type stuff is, is kind of like call 911,

668
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:50,410
-- go to your it person, go to, go find an
-- adult that's perfectly fair.

669
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,579
And if someone falls in the water and you call 911,

670
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:56,270
they're, they're probably going to tell you, is there a rope or a stick nearby,

671
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:56,550
you know,

672
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,770
like do not get in the water if you cannot swim is what they're going to tell you to do

673
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,550
and they're going to tell you, you know, go, go yell for help,

674
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,390
find someone who can help, find someone who knows how to swim.

675
00:29:06,489 --> 00:29:07,660
And I mean,

676
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:12,069
if your cell phone can call 911, it is highly likely

677
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,040
there will be someone within

678
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:19,180
earshot of you, I would guess in many instances. So, yeah, I mean, I, I love this.

679
00:29:19,189 --> 00:29:20,670
This is, this is a great analogy.

680
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,300
Actually, I need to put more thought into this So, anyway.

681
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,430
All right, we're, we're basically out of time here. So I guess

682
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:29,619
any closing thoughts about our hypothetical situation,

683
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,270
if you're not sure what to do, call for help

684
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:34,410
straight up.

685
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,060
That's, and that's something like I'm drilling my kids on is like, if,

686
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:38,630
if things go a bit sideways,

687
00:29:38,949 --> 00:29:41,199
call for help, ask for help, even things like,

688
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,530
you know, like

689
00:29:42,689 --> 00:29:45,489
even simple stuff like opening the peanut butter jar is like, I can't open it.

690
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,619
I'm like, ok, well, what can we do? And he's like, oh, I could ask for help. I'm like a

691
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,229
smash it on the counter.

692
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,349
Yeah.

693
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,670
Well, it's plastic that we tried that once.

694
00:29:57,369 --> 00:30:02,050
Now, there's a very important second part to this we need to add

695
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:04,979
is historically speaking, security.

696
00:30:04,989 --> 00:30:07,829
People have not been helpful where someone would ask for help and

697
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:10,439
we'd often yell at them or demean them or make fun of them

698
00:30:10,939 --> 00:30:14,589
and you cannot do that to people because then they don't like you

699
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:15,270
now,

700
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,959
although they won't come to you for help

701
00:30:17,339 --> 00:30:20,079
if you go to somebody for help and they're mean to you. You're, they're

702
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,400
no, you'll never go back.

703
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:25,410
Exactly. Now, I'm not saying it's not ok to go to the pub with your friends later.

704
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:29,780
Maybe chuckle about some stories because I, my wife actually just went out for, for,

705
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:33,800
uh, dinner with, with, uh, someone in charge of an hr department and

706
00:30:34,329 --> 00:30:36,359
she's got some stories to tell.

707
00:30:37,329 --> 00:30:40,599
It's pretty sweet. It's, it's great anyway. But the point is

708
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:45,280
when someone comes to you be helpful and kind. Right. I mean, don't take abuse.

709
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,099
I'm not saying that.

710
00:30:46,109 --> 00:30:47,459
But like if someone says, oh,

711
00:30:47,469 --> 00:30:50,180
I found this drive and plugged it into my computer and now it's broken, like,

712
00:30:50,189 --> 00:30:51,150
don't yell at them,

713
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,170
help them understand what's going on and make sure

714
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,719
they're going to come back to you again later.

715
00:30:54,739 --> 00:30:57,040
Because if, if you yell at them and make them feel bad,

716
00:30:57,354 --> 00:30:59,535
well, they're just never going to come back to you and that's,

717
00:30:59,545 --> 00:31:01,295
that totally defeats the purpose.

718
00:31:01,305 --> 00:31:01,895
So,

719
00:31:02,025 --> 00:31:06,064
all right, sweet. I love it. This was, this was a fun one. So, thank you, Kurt.
