00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:08,649
Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,659 --> 00:00:11,329
Kurt Siefried and my partner and appreciating good Shawarma.

2
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,079
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,449
I do like good Shawarma.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,209
-- Yeah. And I had bad Shawarma tonight.
-- What does that mean?

5
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,450
I mean, I can think of multiple ways. Shawarma can be bad.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,790
Ok, so Shawarma is supposed to be a pile of meat on a stick roasted

7
00:00:24,229 --> 00:00:24,500
and

8
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:28,069
normally I like to get the mixed Shawarma plate to go because I, well,

9
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:30,510
multiple kinds of shawarma is better than one kind of shawarma.

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,659
Well, obviously,

11
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,290
so what they gave me though was they gave me

12
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:36,750
chicken Shawarma yay and like this kind of grit,

13
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:40,090
like grizzly gritty chunks of beef that were not like

14
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:43,000
Shawarma beef but like kind of like stir fried,

15
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:43,880
I guess or something.

16
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,990
And it was grizzly and unpleasant and dried out

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,790
and I did not care for it and I was sad because it was bad and it was also not Sharma,

18
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:52,580
right?

19
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:53,500
I see.

20
00:00:53,639 --> 00:00:54,150
So

21
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:55,409
yeah,

22
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:57,959
it happens. So I ate the chicken, which was good. But

23
00:00:58,669 --> 00:01:02,229
so, well, see, the problem is I tried a new place that had a 4.5 out of five

24
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,110
and does not deserve it.

25
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,900
-- I don't trust ratings on any apps because it's so easy to game that system.
-- Oh,

26
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,309
these places don't bother with that. Like, this place had 80 ratings.

27
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:12,889
Yeah.

28
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,190
And in general, and the salad was just greens with like one tiny piece of tomato. So,

29
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:20,750
I think part of the challenge is it's maybe they were good a few months ago but they've

30
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,769
back on food costs or something. I don't know.

31
00:01:22,779 --> 00:01:24,430
But that's kind of the impression I got. So

32
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:25,510
I'm just going to go back to

33
00:01:25,809 --> 00:01:28,550
-- it
-- could be whoever cooked tonight, you know, like,

34
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:29,230
well, but here's the thing,

35
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:32,750
I ordered the mixed Shawarma plate and I got one Shawarma and one not Shawarma.

36
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,989
Why are we still talking anyway?

37
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,790
Because it's the same thing as what I was

38
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,589
thinking about earlier today with the S bomb stuff.

39
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,180
Right. I need you to explain to me everything you were thinking about because I have

40
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,260
an odd collection of incoherent ramblings from you and

41
00:01:47,269 --> 00:01:49,349
signals and I'm not sure what you're talking about.

42
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:49,540
Ok.

43
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,989
So at a very high level when you build a piece

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,690
of software and I'm talking like something you ship on CD.

45
00:01:54,699 --> 00:01:57,250
A game, an operating system, something that's in a car. A to

46
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:57,739
CD.

47
00:01:58,309 --> 00:01:59,019
Exactly.

48
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,330
A Blu Ray. No DVD. Do we ship software on Blu Rays? I don't know.

49
00:02:04,029 --> 00:02:05,099
I honestly don't know.

50
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,669
I would imagine they'll fit on a DVD anyways.

51
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,190
The point is what at a very conceptual level goes into it.

52
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,460
And I'm thinking bits go into it like like data

53
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:18,130
libraries, source code, closed source like bits,

54
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,789
I'm thinking the next output or rather the next input would be services.

55
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,259
So for example,

56
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:24,464
like Mastodon,

57
00:02:24,574 --> 00:02:27,565
you want to use an object store like S3 to host your images or

58
00:02:27,934 --> 00:02:31,195
it uses like some kind of like a remote time service,

59
00:02:31,315 --> 00:02:31,684
right

60
00:02:31,854 --> 00:02:32,845
or whatever.

61
00:02:33,494 --> 00:02:35,365
And thinking further on this,

62
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:38,845
that there's also services that go into like building the software.

63
00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:40,884
So for example, like it maybe is hosted on

64
00:02:41,184 --> 00:02:42,684
github and which C I CD pipeline,

65
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,350
you know. So because like, well

66
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:47,050
red hat, for example, right?

67
00:02:47,059 --> 00:02:49,330
We every single build happened in like that

68
00:02:49,339 --> 00:02:51,389
offline container to make sure that we weren't like

69
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:53,710
grabbing something from an online source that then

70
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,210
one day disappears and the whole bill breaks,

71
00:02:56,289 --> 00:02:58,160
they call that Hermetic builds.

72
00:02:58,259 --> 00:02:59,229
Hermetic builds. OK?

73
00:02:59,339 --> 00:03:01,199
And then the next thing

74
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:02,910
and I, the more I think about this,

75
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:06,009
the more I think it fits which is legal obligations, right?

76
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,020
Traditionally in the form of like sort of

77
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:10,020
licenses around the source code or whatever.

78
00:03:10,029 --> 00:03:13,990
For example, if like somebody might have some insane license that says, you know,

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,960
I have to wear a blue shirt while I compile this.

80
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,500
And I know that's a bad example. But

81
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,330
the point is there are legal obligations

82
00:03:20,339 --> 00:03:22,149
both in the traditional software licenses.

83
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:27,960
And for example, maybe I buy a piece of or I buy a piece of music.

84
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:33,690
Well, I can't just, like, buy a CD and then use that music in a game and publish it.

85
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:34,869
Like, I'm gonna get sued.

86
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,160
Like, they're going to want me to license it. Right.

87
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:37,669
Yeah,

88
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,419
that's right.

89
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,800
So, I think legal

90
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,229
and,

91
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:42,070
and then the other thing I was thinking was

92
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:42,869
what does

93
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:47,539
such a software or something producing it, it basically produces the same things.

94
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,809
Again, it produces data bits,

95
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:52,419
images, text binaries,

96
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,009
whatever config files,

97
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:59,330
it produces potentially services and it produces legal obligations.

98
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,130
So it kind of feeds in on itself, right?

99
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:02,679
The the whole, it's just a whole, you know,

100
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,839
like a wily wobbly mish mash ecosystem rainforest like

101
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,419
doctor who in the it crowd says and so

102
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,440
because I've been thinking about

103
00:04:10,779 --> 00:04:10,800
eal

104
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:14,550
and at first I was sort of thinking about sort of more the technical side of like, OK,

105
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:17,540
so currently the idea behind what a lot of people think of EB

106
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:17,950
is,

107
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:22,369
is I I have this thing and I shove it through my S bomb X ray and

108
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,329
it says like it contains this and that and peanuts and live weasels and oh my God,

109
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:27,739
what is this thing that's out of date?

110
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,989
And that's, that's a good start.

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,299
But what if, for example,

112
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,750
what if I ship a Mastodon container that relies on an S3 bucket for hosting images?

113
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:38,959
As I understand most PLM

114
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:42,864
systems right now are gonna be like whatever man like, they don't see that.

115
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,524
They don't because they don't look for it.

116
00:04:44,614 --> 00:04:46,515
They might see an S3 dependency and say, hey,

117
00:04:46,524 --> 00:04:49,864
this thing has an S3 library but then it's on a human to rec like

118
00:04:50,005 --> 00:04:52,075
a human's gonna have to dig through all these libraries and be like, OK,

119
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:54,674
which of these actually create like a remote requirement?

120
00:04:54,684 --> 00:04:54,915
Well,

121
00:04:54,924 --> 00:04:56,725
you could use an S3 library with a local

122
00:04:56,734 --> 00:04:59,045
object store that just happens to present as S3,

123
00:04:59,054 --> 00:04:59,364
right?

124
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,825
Because, well, they all do now because that's the default,

125
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:06,045
-- right?
-- I mean, so I have a good example for this, we have

126
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:07,899
a product at work

127
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:10,549
that needs a postscript database,

128
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:11,260
right?

129
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,380
And so

130
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,859
we have a, we will say we'll put shipping quotes,

131
00:05:15,989 --> 00:05:23,019
we have the postscript container in our container registry that you can use or

132
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,920
most of our customers like to use just like R DS, right? From Amazon.

133
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:30,470
So it's either or it's we need a database.

134
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:32,190
We don't really care where it comes from,

135
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,399
but we'll give you one just because we're nice

136
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,070
and I could totally see a different vendor. For example,

137
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:38,820
what if they

138
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,190
require to use?

139
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,609
And for those of you that maybe don't know R

140
00:05:42,619 --> 00:05:46,140
DS is a relational database service at Amazon web services.

141
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:49,709
-- I I have no idea what R DS stands for
-- relational database services.

142
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:50,309
Yeah.

143
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,579
And you basically get your choice of my SQL post

144
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,869
Gra SQL or the Amazon versions of those like Pera

145
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,739
and whatever

146
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,619
anyways.

147
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:00,420
So, but here's the thing, there's sort of a couple of options here.

148
00:06:00,429 --> 00:06:02,640
One you could ship like you can give them,

149
00:06:02,649 --> 00:06:05,179
you can run it locally in a container and you ship that.

150
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:09,170
Cool. Thank you two. You make it like a config thing so that we already have a nice Pro

151
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,269
SQL cluster.

152
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:13,190
We'd prefer to use that because we already have a bunch of DB A S running this. OK?

153
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,079
Cool, do that. But a piece of software could say, for example, you must use R DS

154
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,170
at Amazon or even could say

155
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,250
you have to use one that we run and we charge more for that.

156
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,440
Or maybe that's why you're paying them a monthly subscription.

157
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,369
And here's the thing,

158
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:28,589
wouldn't it be nice if your s

159
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,970
bomb told you which of these four things was going on or what kind of is happening?

160
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:32,850
So Espo

161
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,440
isn't that advanced yet? I mean, I can.

162
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,739
So a lot of the things you've talked about are

163
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,839
being worked on CIA has some S PM working groups.

164
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:46,880
There's for example, you're talking about like builds and you're talking about

165
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,029
post build.

166
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,859
There's like all these stages and there's actually there's a document I'll

167
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,119
link in the show notes that's currently in draft from Cissa.

168
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,559
So don't tell anyone I'm linking it,

169
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,519
but it, it lays out here. I haven't sent this to you.

170
00:06:57,529 --> 00:06:59,420
I'll send it to you in signal while we're chatting.

171
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,890
I just, I love like

172
00:07:01,109 --> 00:07:03,910
I get kind of why people want to keep the draft somewhat private,

173
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,579
but especially drafts of documents that are meant to be widely shared.

174
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:08,619
And like we're hoping people will actually do this.

175
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:10,299
It's not

176
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,140
a great deal.

177
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:12,989
But anyway, they break down.

178
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,790
There's these phases, they've got, I'll just read them out.

179
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:16,899
There's design source, build, analyzed,

180
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,750
deployed and run time and you can probably figure out what all those are.

181
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,000
And it makes sense because there isn't like one way to do an S bomb,

182
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,480
there isn't one stage that really matters.

183
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:30,299
I mean, everyone's going to be different. Like a, a great example is

184
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:34,700
there are a lot of tools that folk like like github

185
00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:35,769
has depend

186
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:35,980
aot,

187
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:38,549
for example, right? Like for example, in depend a

188
00:07:38,679 --> 00:07:38,700
bot

189
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:41,269
has a variant of S

190
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,579
bomb. It has to do

191
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:44,980
to figure out what you have and how to upgrade it.

192
00:07:44,989 --> 00:07:48,220
And that's obviously in the very source universe versus there's

193
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,980
other tooling that will look at like a container image.

194
00:07:50,989 --> 00:07:53,029
You know, we've got the, the tool sift from

195
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,459
Acor that looks at container images and,

196
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,579
and you can look at stuff on disk for example, but it generally

197
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:03,429
speaking, it's after the source stage and that's fine. And like github

198
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,980
does a great job with source, we do a great job but not source.

199
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:07,720
We don't do a great job with source github

200
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,589
doesn't do any of that other stuff, you know, and I think this is we,

201
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,200
we've reached the point where

202
00:08:14,809 --> 00:08:19,230
I, I always, I like to talk about problems in the context of like layers.

203
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:22,459
And one of my favorite examples is I remember when I started at elastic,

204
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,809
we didn't have single sign on, right?

205
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,079
And all the customers complained about was single sign on.

206
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,679
We got single sign on.

207
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:31,029
And now all the customers complained about like 10 things instead of the one thing.

208
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:34,820
And I think that's the same deal with SS bomb where we've been just talking about S

209
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,049
bomb and now that we've kind of peeled that first layer off.

210
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,869
Now there's like five problems under that.

211
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,229
And as we peel each one of those, there's five more under those. And so

212
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,299
-- we're going to see this keep exploding. Yeah.
-- Well, and so OK, two quick things.

213
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:48,950
One, I never really thought this out loud but yeah, S

214
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:53,479
bomb can run for example on your source or on the, the things

215
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:57,789
it can run on how it's shipped. So R PM packages, containers, whatever.

216
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,229
But and then there's also that it needs to run potentially

217
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:05,174
on the deployed systems because going back to the database example.

218
00:09:05,184 --> 00:09:06,525
Well, if this uses Postgres

219
00:09:06,744 --> 00:09:08,835
QL cool, like is it shipped with it?

220
00:09:08,844 --> 00:09:12,364
Well, then I need to make sure that version's up to date or if it relies on Amazon rds,

221
00:09:12,525 --> 00:09:16,815
for example, as an extreme example, I have seen software which says, hey,

222
00:09:16,905 --> 00:09:18,755
you actually have to run an outdated version because

223
00:09:18,765 --> 00:09:20,335
we don't know how to talk to the newer version

224
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,909
that happens all the time. Absolutely.

225
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:24,090
Now, let me, let me,

226
00:09:24,099 --> 00:09:26,830
let me cook your noodle for a second here and we'll talk about the build that

227
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,169
bomb.

228
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,900
So here's something to think about. When do you build software?

229
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,590
Like for example, what version of compiler did you use?

230
00:09:34,869 --> 00:09:34,960
I was

231
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,119
about

232
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:38,739
-- to what was the version of the libraries?
-- Right. That was my second next thought.

233
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:43,219
There's all this other like tool chain stuff, right? That goes on top of that, that

234
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:47,260
we don't almost nobody tracks this, right? Like you have no idea.

235
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:47,599
I mean,

236
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:51,000
one of my favorite examples always was most people don't know this but you know,

237
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,989
there was uh Red Hat had Red Hat Enterprise Linux and there was sent

238
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,099
os and sent os always lagged Red Hat Enterprise Linux by several months on,

239
00:09:58,109 --> 00:09:59,210
on big releases.

240
00:09:59,219 --> 00:10:03,010
And the reason for that is you have to actually build things in

241
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,869
a certain order because like when when you build a Linux distribution,

242
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,729
you don't just like build all the packages,

243
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,979
you have to build this package first and then build these

244
00:10:09,989 --> 00:10:12,659
other packages and then go back and build some other things again

245
00:10:12,989 --> 00:10:15,489
because like things have dependencies on each other

246
00:10:15,619 --> 00:10:16,830
and people don't realize that.

247
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,479
But like as Red Hat was developing Red Hat Enterprise Linux,

248
00:10:19,969 --> 00:10:23,359
they were building things in a very specific way that they wouldn't tell anyone

249
00:10:23,369 --> 00:10:27,840
So the sento s people had to basically figure out what the order was

250
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:29,729
and then they had to go and do it again.

251
00:10:29,739 --> 00:10:32,099
And so you don't think about this kind of stuff, but

252
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,239
that is

253
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:34,690
super important

254
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,609
and we throw away all that metadata today.

255
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,390
Well, and, and that's exactly where I was going with this, which is,

256
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,659
which leads to the fact that there are certain things

257
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,049
that are either

258
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,229
not easily testable or maybe unt testable and it's on

259
00:10:48,239 --> 00:10:51,030
sort of whoever produced that component or shipped that component

260
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:54,109
to tell you. So a great example of this would be a JPEG.

261
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:55,929
Like if I download a JPEG online,

262
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,239
I don't know what license it's under,

263
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:02,400
it may be old enough that it's public domain or it might be, you know, some pa

264
00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:05,960
copy of something that is supposed to cost a million dollars, right?

265
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:06,789
And so

266
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,489
uh whoever kind of has actually owns that J peg, if they, you know,

267
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,609
sell it to somebody or license it to somebody or whatever,

268
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:14,994
it's also on them to give them.

269
00:11:15,005 --> 00:11:18,724
Like for example, the legal terms and obligations that come with it, right? Because

270
00:11:18,924 --> 00:11:20,674
I can't like sell you a JPEG

271
00:11:20,945 --> 00:11:23,835
and then come back and say, oh by the way, you're not allowed to do this with it.

272
00:11:23,844 --> 00:11:25,965
Like that has to be in the original contract and

273
00:11:25,974 --> 00:11:28,544
license and whatever and so on a technical level,

274
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:29,635
a great example, just be,

275
00:11:30,114 --> 00:11:32,594
where was the source code originally hosted. Was it in github

276
00:11:32,755 --> 00:11:35,395
or GIT labs? Because those, or, or

277
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:38,474
some person's workstation because those are like three very,

278
00:11:38,484 --> 00:11:39,695
very different answers.

279
00:11:39,705 --> 00:11:43,864
Because for example, well, like we've seen several C I CD systems broken into

280
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:47,500
and it would be nice for like, me as a user to know.

281
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:52,520
Oh, I, I might be affected because I also use that C I CD system or I use something that,

282
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:55,809
well, let's throw solar winds under the bus yet again.

283
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,260
Oh, you know,

284
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,880
I use a piece of solar wind software that was

285
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,559
compiled during the time that solar winds was fully compromised.

286
00:12:00,609 --> 00:12:01,280
Fantastic.

287
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:02,820
Um

288
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,840
And so I'm just, I'm looking at this and I'm thinking essentially

289
00:12:07,219 --> 00:12:10,900
to some degree, we, we'll always have to do archaeological

290
00:12:11,619 --> 00:12:14,869
analysis, you know, that sort of investigative analysis

291
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:20,039
because there will always be something I buy or use or license

292
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:24,169
that ships without some metadata that I would like to see probably.

293
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:26,820
And if I have a system that can do that, then, well,

294
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,739
I have all that metadata potentially.

295
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,580
Whereas, you know, if I rely on, like if I rely on, well,

296
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,700
I mean, there are still open

297
00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:35,380
source projects that don't ship with an actual proper license,

298
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,099
like they don't have a license files

299
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,229
of stuff, you know,

300
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:38,820
and

301
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,260
so if we can't even get people to include a license file,

302
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,909
I doubt that they're gonna include like

303
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,940
in their tar ball.

304
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,429
Like here's exactly how it was compiled on what system,

305
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,299
with what versions of which flags and everything.

306
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,609
It's like, no, here's just a binary that kind of mostly works on most Linuxes,

307
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:53,640
-- you know.
-- That's right.

308
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,190
That's right.

309
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,619
So, I mean,

310
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:59,429
there's a lot to unpack in what you just said and I want to start out with kind of a,

311
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,369
like a PS A announcement for everyone is PS A

312
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,539
that doesn't make sense because E A stands for announcement,

313
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:05,760
-- public
-- service announcement.

314
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:09,489
Yeah, I know. But I said PS A announcement because everyone says PS A announcement.

315
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,940
-- Well,
-- you're going to go to the ATM machine later. I do

316
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,130
go to ATM machine. Yes.

317
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,179
So

318
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:18,830
everything Kurt and I are talking about is basically magic fairy dust land.

319
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:19,880
And

320
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:23,159
if, if you read the Twitters or the whatevers,

321
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,729
it feels like everyone else has a lot of this

322
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:27,609
stuff figured out and I'm going to tell you now,

323
00:13:27,619 --> 00:13:31,400
literally no one has this figured out anyone who pretends they does, they does.

324
00:13:31,409 --> 00:13:32,539
-- I'm doing all right. I
-- would

325
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:32,700
say

326
00:13:33,075 --> 00:13:33,585
worse than this.

327
00:13:33,594 --> 00:13:37,405
Some people have it figured out in the sense of given enough time and effort.

328
00:13:37,414 --> 00:13:40,304
They can do it manually once a year with something like log for J

329
00:13:41,275 --> 00:13:41,635
and that's,

330
00:13:42,025 --> 00:13:42,635
that's what I'm saying.

331
00:13:42,645 --> 00:13:44,924
That's even worse because we're not at a point where we're saying, wow,

332
00:13:44,934 --> 00:13:45,914
we can't even do this.

333
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:46,784
We're saying, no, no, no.

334
00:13:46,794 --> 00:13:50,224
Like I can build a rocket once every year and it probably doesn't kill everybody,

335
00:13:50,234 --> 00:13:50,955
maybe sort of,

336
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:52,109
but that's the thing

337
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,260
when these

338
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,270
capabilities are needed because of something like log for

339
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,349
J where you have to actually track it down everywhere

340
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,950
we end up with these insane.

341
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,809
Like here's like, here's this like 16 bit string,

342
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,309
you can grip everything on your hard disk for or

343
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,359
you know, just all this insane stuff that like we're,

344
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,669
I mean,

345
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,270
I remember the log for JAY, the amount of detection stuff that came out for it,

346
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,299
you know, Yara rules uh Sam Grep, just good old Grep

347
00:14:18,549 --> 00:14:19,409
MD five sons,

348
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,690
Shaw 16

349
00:14:22,419 --> 00:14:22,909
and

350
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,940
OK, great. Now, like, you know, you're assisted men with 100 systems.

351
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:27,039
Good luck.

352
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:30,080
I hope you have a lot of coffee. We, we need to,

353
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:31,969
we definitely have the need for it

354
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,320
and people

355
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:35,559
right now only do it once or twice a year

356
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,520
because doing it any more than that would kill them.

357
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:43,080
Well, I mean, look, there is tooling that exists and it's getting better

358
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:43,840
and

359
00:14:44,099 --> 00:14:46,400
a lot of this is coming along,

360
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:49,510
but we're a long ways away from, for example,

361
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,200
being able to say like this JPEG image you have has this license on it.

362
00:14:53,609 --> 00:14:57,250
-- We generally can't do that.
-- Well, ironically, reverse image search with TI

363
00:14:57,549 --> 00:14:58,229
I mean,

364
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,320
but yeah, I know what you

365
00:14:59,440 --> 00:14:59,559
mean.

366
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:01,119
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

367
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:05,440
What we can do easily is like if you're, if you have a No Js project,

368
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:09,260
we can tell you with pretty much 100% accuracy,

369
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,489
what all your packages are and what the licenses of

370
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,799
those packages are like the tooling can do that.

371
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:15,599
But that's an easy example.

372
00:15:15,674 --> 00:15:18,284
Well, and so for example, hypothetical question here,

373
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:21,645
what happens if you see one of those curl blah, blah, blah pipe bash things?

374
00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:26,284
So there isn't generally tooling to the. So OK, actually,

375
00:15:26,455 --> 00:15:31,044
the correct answer to that is this is where the S bomb in stages comes from.

376
00:15:31,724 --> 00:15:36,775
And there's a concept that is known as S bomb drift. So what happened is

377
00:15:37,109 --> 00:15:38,919
I have my source

378
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,369
repo I scan it

379
00:15:40,469 --> 00:15:44,229
right. Then I do my build and we'll put building quotes for no J

380
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:45,679
and then I scan it

381
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,159
and I'll look at what's different

382
00:15:47,409 --> 00:15:48,719
and then I'll take that and I'll put it

383
00:15:48,729 --> 00:15:50,630
in a container and I'll look at what's different.

384
00:15:50,969 --> 00:15:54,440
And I actually have, I have a blog post on the Inco blog. I'll link to,

385
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,619
-- I guess
-- what dependencies, especially

386
00:15:56,849 --> 00:15:57,219
because, yeah,

387
00:15:57,229 --> 00:15:59,330
you say I want this but something else pulls

388
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,570
in something newer or older or holds it back.

389
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,869
-- And
-- so if you are running a weird curl command, you can say, oh,

390
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,150
between these two steps, something weird happened,

391
00:16:08,479 --> 00:16:10,229
let's go see what it was.

392
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,669
And that's where, then you have to have a human go and you know,

393
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,099
dig in the dirt and stuff.

394
00:16:14,109 --> 00:16:14,460
But

395
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:15,619
at this point

396
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,830
that's kind of how you could do that.

397
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,099
Well, and this is one of the things I'm thinking where doing S

398
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:21,700
bomb

399
00:16:22,539 --> 00:16:27,200
will be possible for open source because third parties can choose to do it

400
00:16:27,669 --> 00:16:28,409
and publish it.

401
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:30,750
Whereas you can't really do that with close sources easily without

402
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,669
like buying a license to it and running it through.

403
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,049
But for example, I mean, somebody could,

404
00:16:35,309 --> 00:16:39,989
somebody could crawl N PM, js.org or you know, whatever, right?

405
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:41,789
Or all the go binaries, right?

406
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:45,200
Somebody could crawl all the open source go Binaries on github

407
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,609
and publish the results somewhere, you know,

408
00:16:47,619 --> 00:16:49,820
for me to use and not have to do it myself.

409
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,380
But so there is some things happening here as well.

410
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,890
There's a group actually,

411
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,909
that's part of the open ssf that I I I'm the co-chair of called SBO

412
00:16:59,229 --> 00:17:02,099
everywhere and we're still putting a lot of the pieces together.

413
00:17:02,109 --> 00:17:04,280
So no one's really heard about anything. But like

414
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,979
one of the things we're talking about is

415
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:14,170
we want every open source project to release an S bomb next to their tar ball, right?

416
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,689
-- Every one of them you want
-- to boil the ocean and have every open source project,

417
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:19,650
do it themselves or a third party does it.

418
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,680
So we don't want third parties doing it.

419
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:26,650
We want the project doing it at BUILD, generating an S

420
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,858
bomb at BUILD,

421
00:17:27,989 --> 00:17:31,569
gives you different metadata than generating an S bomb after build.

422
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:36,680
Now, one of the things we recognize is you can't just say like, oh open source,

423
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:40,180
you should go do this like that is not, I mean, we, we have the whole episode.

424
00:17:40,189 --> 00:17:41,819
Open source owes you nothing.

425
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:45,310
-- We can't even get them to put licenses on their software.
-- But who cares?

426
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:46,819
It's not their problem. They don't care.

427
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,219
So what we actually want to do

428
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:50,900
is do the work for them

429
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,670
and we're putting together some plans and proposals not to say, oh, open source,

430
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,280
you should do this.

431
00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:00,489
But we want to show up and be like open source. We want to do this for you

432
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,910
and learn lessons along the way. And there will be people who are like, I don't care.

433
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,180
I don't want to do this and that. That's ok. That's fine.

434
00:18:06,189 --> 00:18:08,420
There's no one's gonna make you do anything. But

435
00:18:08,969 --> 00:18:10,140
it's definitely,

436
00:18:10,449 --> 00:18:12,969
and, and it, it's comical though because like

437
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,130
bomb again is one of my favorite things where you

438
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,530
look at what everyone's talking about on social media.

439
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,349
You read these news stories and

440
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,109
there's all these people saying, oh open source needs to generate S bombs and it,

441
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,449
it's like, yeah.

442
00:18:24,459 --> 00:18:29,709
No, no, they don't. I mean, if, if, if you want an S bomb for them, go help the project,

443
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,599
send them a patch. Are you gonna do that? Oh, you're not. Why?

444
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:35,459
Because it's easier to complain on Twitter. Oh, ok. Good job to you.

445
00:18:35,469 --> 00:18:40,229
You know, and that's just kind of the universe we have today and, and it's tough, man.

446
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:43,270
It's really tough. So, anyway, back to your original point though.

447
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:45,260
So third party

448
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,780
having like a clearing house for all this stuff,

449
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,209
the kind of problem I think you run into with that

450
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:52,150
is.

451
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:53,680
So let's say

452
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,030
you have a project that's generating an S

453
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:56,300
bomb.

454
00:18:56,449 --> 00:18:57,920
How are you generating it?

455
00:18:58,089 --> 00:18:59,800
Where are you getting your data from?

456
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:03,099
How do I know what you're doing is even remotely accurate?

457
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:07,520
Well, I mean, in theory, I download their Tar Ball, you know, check the shaw 256.

458
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:09,160
Publish sig. Make sure it's the right Tar Ball.

459
00:19:09,564 --> 00:19:12,555
And then I published an S bomb for that Tar Ball of that

460
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:17,055
-- cha 256 sig. But
-- how do I, what did you use to do it? How do I know you did make sense?

461
00:19:17,064 --> 00:19:19,135
-- And
-- actually, and, and that was something I was going to say is

462
00:19:19,444 --> 00:19:22,665
part of what doesn't make a lot of sense here is

463
00:19:22,994 --> 00:19:25,675
why would I download third party s bomb data

464
00:19:25,685 --> 00:19:28,425
unless I can know exactly how they generated,

465
00:19:28,464 --> 00:19:30,175
which sort of strongly implies.

466
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,959
I want to see their tools, which means it better be open source like I, I, you know,

467
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:35,310
and

468
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,790
now in that instance, why don't you just do it yourself

469
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,890
exactly where I was going with this? Right. That's, that's exactly it.

470
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:41,869
Right.

471
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,760
And, and the one argument would be is it would, you know,

472
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:45,439
it would save a bit of carbon if you know,

473
00:19:45,449 --> 00:19:47,770
one person did it against that thing and then publish it.

474
00:19:47,864 --> 00:19:49,175
We don't all run, you know, we don't have

475
00:19:49,494 --> 00:19:52,084
like, what if everybody does it on every pull of node?

476
00:19:52,094 --> 00:19:55,344
Like that's gonna be a ton of compute time versus, you know.

477
00:19:56,045 --> 00:19:56,114
Yes,

478
00:19:56,334 --> 00:19:59,204
absolutely. But, yeah, and then essentially that's where I was going with.

479
00:19:59,214 --> 00:20:00,125
This is like, well,

480
00:20:00,255 --> 00:20:02,724
yeah, why don't I just do it myself to put it bluntly,

481
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,314
I think one of the challenges of SS

482
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:05,005
balm will be

483
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:09,089
the only way to fully understand what the tool is

484
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:11,199
doing and to replicate it is of course,

485
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:14,050
is to have the tool and ideally it be open source.

486
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,819
So again, do it yourself.

487
00:20:17,459 --> 00:20:20,300
And I think that's kind of what's gonna have to happen. And

488
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,219
that's not to say that you can't have a service based on this, right?

489
00:20:23,229 --> 00:20:24,900
Like Red Hat's a great example.

490
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,849
You can go get free Linux or run Sento.

491
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,229
Why would you pay for Red Hat?

492
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:31,459
Well, because things like support and it's just easier and blah, blah, blah,

493
00:20:31,469 --> 00:20:35,180
there's a bunch of good reasons to actually pay for your Linux or your

494
00:20:35,439 --> 00:20:37,339
word processor or whatever. And you know,

495
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:39,729
the free ones are, I'm not saying free ones are bad.

496
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,089
I'm just saying sometimes there are good reasons to pay for stuff.

497
00:20:42,739 --> 00:20:45,540
Yeah, there's, there's many, many reasons, I mean,

498
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,969
and like my favorite example is always when,

499
00:20:48,739 --> 00:20:50,469
when I set up a server,

500
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:53,430
I'm happy running Debian on it, right?

501
00:20:53,439 --> 00:20:55,550
I'm more than capable of dealing with that and fixing it.

502
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,150
But when you're a company and it's mission critical

503
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,910
-- and you're, if someone quits your
-- infrastructure

504
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:02,750
and who says you're going to be there next week?

505
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:05,349
Yeah, exactly. Like I, I totally get it.

506
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:08,219
-- It makes perfect sense
-- because the other thing I'm looking at, for example,

507
00:21:08,229 --> 00:21:10,250
here's a hypothetical is what about,

508
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:10,790
you know,

509
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,849
S balm identifying chat GP T or stable diffusion generated content that I

510
00:21:14,859 --> 00:21:18,569
suspect will become a concern for some people long term because perfect example is

511
00:21:18,729 --> 00:21:22,770
uh like marking and cheat detection for like university projects,

512
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,880
right? We already have plagiarism bots for essays.

513
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,770
Well, we're

514
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:30,660
gonna end up with and, and this also kind of,

515
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:34,069
I was kind of thinking about this and I'm like certain programming problems,

516
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,420
there's really not that many different ways to program up a solution.

517
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:41,280
Like if I ask you to, you know, one of those classes like build me a linked list or,

518
00:21:41,349 --> 00:21:44,420
you know, swap two variables in place with a system with no memory or,

519
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,869
you know, whatever those goofy examples are like,

520
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:50,449
yeah, your answer's gonna look pretty much bit for bit like, well,

521
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:52,150
the stack overflow answer because that's

522
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:53,569
the correct answer,

523
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:54,579
you know,

524
00:21:55,479 --> 00:22:00,439
so fun fact. A I generated content can't be copyrighted.

525
00:22:00,829 --> 00:22:03,680
Yeah. The whole um the monkey that took a selfie with a camera

526
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:06,449
and they ruled that it had to be a person holding the copyright.

527
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,770
Now, here's the thing. The A I can't hold the copyright

528
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,520
but the company or the people of the company can hold the copy

529
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:15,250
so far. Ok. So I actually just listened to a

530
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:17,170
radio show about

531
00:22:17,329 --> 00:22:22,180
specifically Chat GP T I forget who it was. They were talking to a lawyer,

532
00:22:22,569 --> 00:22:24,469
an intellectual property lawyer.

533
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:27,180
And the lawyer said that at this time

534
00:22:27,469 --> 00:22:31,670
based on existing law and precedent in the courts

535
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:36,280
that any content generated by like dolly or Chat GP T

536
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,229
is

537
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:40,300
un copyrightable by any party.

538
00:22:40,449 --> 00:22:44,979
The A I generated the content, the company that wrote the A I doesn't own the content.

539
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:47,430
The person who asked the question doesn't own the content,

540
00:22:47,439 --> 00:22:49,329
the content cannot be copyrighted.

541
00:22:49,339 --> 00:22:52,739
What happens if they A I generate content and then have a

542
00:22:52,885 --> 00:22:53,845
to massage it a bit.

543
00:22:53,855 --> 00:22:58,166
-- If a human changes it, then it is copyrightable by that human
-- because,

544
00:22:58,255 --> 00:22:59,806
and how much does it have to be changed though?

545
00:22:59,816 --> 00:23:00,806
One pixel? And

546
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:01,765
well, that,

547
00:23:02,446 --> 00:23:02,576
that's

548
00:23:03,776 --> 00:23:05,196
no, no, there is a,

549
00:23:05,536 --> 00:23:07,765
I, I forget those terms. I'm not a lawyer obviously.

550
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:11,005
And again, if you're getting legal advice from this podcast, you're screwed.

551
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:13,416
So, but no, there is a, there's a legal

552
00:23:13,621 --> 00:23:18,202
precedent about how much you have to transform a work before it becomes derivative.

553
00:23:18,322 --> 00:23:22,862
Like, and I don't know what what it is, but there is a legal definition of that.

554
00:23:22,871 --> 00:23:25,302
So you have to take the original work and turn it into a

555
00:23:25,312 --> 00:23:28,442
-- derivative work
-- because I could see like this is going a bit dystopian,

556
00:23:28,452 --> 00:23:31,531
but I could totally see like sweatshops and cheap countries with people like

557
00:23:31,832 --> 00:23:34,131
tracing digital art to, you know,

558
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,880
say that it was human generated. Uh let's not give them any ideas

559
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:38,630
seriously.

560
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,189
But,

561
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,729
and that's that, you know,

562
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:42,560
so because I'm looking at this from sort of

563
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:43,790
a practical point of view of what's going to

564
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:48,709
happen in more the near term, but also long term, like more like to put it simply,

565
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,430
there is not a single

566
00:23:50,699 --> 00:23:53,180
major application on my phone that runs

567
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,770
without access to some service on the internet.

568
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,569
Yes,

569
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,680
that is correct.

570
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,109
And, and to date,

571
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,300
there's really nothing in the

572
00:24:01,699 --> 00:24:04,900
bomb universe right now that accounts for things like services.

573
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,560
And I understand that because I think

574
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:10,589
that is one of the probably second or third step beyond where we're at.

575
00:24:10,939 --> 00:24:11,400
Like,

576
00:24:11,699 --> 00:24:14,339
i it's very crawl, walk, run. Right.

577
00:24:14,349 --> 00:24:18,520
And, and I think we forget that a lot of times and there are people who complain about,

578
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:18,660
oh,

579
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,500
bombs don't do services so they're useless.

580
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:24,530
And it's like, well, I mean, not yet but they, they will like, it'll come,

581
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:25,209
I mean,

582
00:24:25,219 --> 00:24:28,719
it's kind of like you've been talking about security vulnerabilities in the cloud,

583
00:24:28,729 --> 00:24:29,030
right?

584
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,560
No one's tracking them or paying attention to them. Like,

585
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,030
that's weird. You know,

586
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:39,540
mostly because they're not, I hate, well, I think fundamentally they're not so bad

587
00:24:39,739 --> 00:24:42,670
that we've had that moment of, oh my God, this is truly terrible.

588
00:24:42,699 --> 00:24:45,949
And that's also not even happen for real software where we've seen,

589
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:49,130
well, like ransomware, for example, has, you know, actually, oh,

590
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,130
the British government just identified ransomware as like, what do they call it?

591
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,160
Like a tier one concern.

592
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:57,170
Yeah, I remember reading about that. It's very bad

593
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:01,280
is basically what they said and for English people to call something very bad, it's,

594
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,170
you know, it's serious,

595
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,290
like they were putting it up there with terrorism.

596
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:04,979
I mean,

597
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,329
I won't disagree with that.

598
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:11,130
Well, when you think about the cost, I mean, here's the thing, if I,

599
00:25:11,489 --> 00:25:13,750
if somebody did, well to put it bluntly, if,

600
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,609
if you have a problem that's costing you hundreds

601
00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:17,469
of millions or billions of dollars a year.

602
00:25:17,979 --> 00:25:20,189
Yeah, that's, that's a real problem.

603
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:23,170
Well, remember when all the UK hospitals shut down

604
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,619
of ransomware for the not Pet M ss?

605
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,630
Oh, here we go. UK government declares ransomware a tier one national security

606
00:25:29,739 --> 00:25:31,089
on security threat,

607
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:33,790
on part with terrorism and military crisis between states

608
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,109
and the other thing to think too is like,

609
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:37,540
there is a lot of ransomware that is, you know,

610
00:25:38,349 --> 00:25:39,449
they live in Russia,

611
00:25:39,709 --> 00:25:41,449
they don't attack Russian systems.

612
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,300
Right.

613
00:25:43,329 --> 00:25:45,380
Well, they can't, they don't want to get in trouble. Like

614
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,920
-- there's an agreement.
-- There was a guy called Fons Klaus

615
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,770
that talked about this a long time ago,

616
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,410
you know, real politic and such.

617
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,459
So, yeah, I don't know. It's, but back to the SBA

618
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:55,089
thing.

619
00:25:55,099 --> 00:25:55,369
Well,

620
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,790
we have to walk but at the same time it's

621
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,689
also sometimes useful to know where we might want to go

622
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:04,890
two or five or even 10 steps down the road.

623
00:26:05,329 --> 00:26:06,469
I mean. Sure.

624
00:26:06,609 --> 00:26:07,109
Sure.

625
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:09,650
And I think a lot of people are thinking about this stuff

626
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,270
and we know things like services are going to have to come.

627
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,150
We know there's a lot of other artifacts we're gonna have to track,

628
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,109
we know we're going to have to do a better job.

629
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:20,780
Like here, here's a great example actually. So in a, in a running system,

630
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:24,630
right? When, if we look at the list of S bombs, uh what is it called, run time?

631
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,829
So there is currently

632
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:32,810
a question about runtime of what is included in a runtime S bomb.

633
00:26:32,829 --> 00:26:36,560
And there are some people who say, oh, I just want to know like everything on disk

634
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:40,390
and there's people who are saying I want to know what every process running is

635
00:26:40,469 --> 00:26:43,849
and I want to even know like what is in the memory of those processes.

636
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:47,750
And like that is not an unreasonable ask in a lot of ways

637
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,959
I can think of things where I would color it.

638
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,510
-- But
-- at the same time, like I agree, that is a good idea.

639
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,869
But I think for the moment like,

640
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,280
let's just figure out what's on disk and then we'll look at what the processes are.

641
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:00,589
But you know what I mean? Like

642
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:04,229
there's so many questions and there's so much unanswered,

643
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:06,505
but there are a lot of people working on this, I mean,

644
00:27:06,675 --> 00:27:08,714
one of the things I always talk about, so I've got that SBO

645
00:27:08,885 --> 00:27:10,844
everywhere meeting, which I'll, I'll put a link in the show notes.

646
00:27:10,854 --> 00:27:13,194
If anyone's interested in joining the group, like it's open to all.

647
00:27:13,204 --> 00:27:15,244
We, we, we'd love to have you. But anyway,

648
00:27:15,395 --> 00:27:16,944
every time we have a meeting,

649
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,765
I learn about some new, like s

650
00:27:18,935 --> 00:27:20,114
bomb working group or SBO

651
00:27:20,285 --> 00:27:22,854
project or S bomb, something that I've never even heard about.

652
00:27:22,864 --> 00:27:26,025
And I feel like I'm pretty deep in these weeds as it is.

653
00:27:26,035 --> 00:27:27,875
And there's so much, I don't know.

654
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,219
Well, and so, and then there's another thing I was thinking about was ok.

655
00:27:31,229 --> 00:27:33,020
So we recently went through actually iso

656
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:35,160
9001 certification at the cloud security lines.

657
00:27:35,469 --> 00:27:38,579
And it was funny because the others like, do you have a list of all your suppliers?

658
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:42,180
And I'm like, oh, who do I ever have this giant spreadsheet that goes way back?

659
00:27:42,349 --> 00:27:46,589
And it's not, it's a list of every supplier. Why we use them? What we use them for?

660
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:50,339
Do they do H SSL and TLS? Right? Because it's that,

661
00:27:50,824 --> 00:27:53,395
which at the time was a good question.

662
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,285
Where is there GDPR statement, stuff like that?

663
00:27:55,295 --> 00:27:57,064
You know, do they process pi I, what kind of P I,

664
00:27:57,084 --> 00:27:59,925
is it transitory like or is it stored or blah, blah, blah.

665
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:01,094
Anyways. And

666
00:28:01,324 --> 00:28:02,454
one of the things

667
00:28:02,574 --> 00:28:04,584
he raised was, why do you use these vendors?

668
00:28:04,594 --> 00:28:07,055
And I'm like, well, because we have like some case, we just have to like,

669
00:28:07,064 --> 00:28:10,415
we use Microsoft Office because that's what you do.

670
00:28:10,425 --> 00:28:12,375
When you get a word document, you pay them.

671
00:28:12,545 --> 00:28:13,464
Same thing with Adobe.

672
00:28:13,944 --> 00:28:14,494
You know,

673
00:28:14,714 --> 00:28:16,704
if you do digital design, you pay Adobe.

674
00:28:17,385 --> 00:28:17,814
And

675
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:20,489
one thing he taught me though, it was interesting was

676
00:28:20,989 --> 00:28:23,530
like, not only why did you pick them but how hard,

677
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,729
like what would it take to get rid of them?

678
00:28:25,739 --> 00:28:28,829
And I'm like, well, some, we just can't. And so I started to think about the

679
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:29,099
fib.

680
00:28:29,739 --> 00:28:31,729
So some are pretty fungible. Like we use

681
00:28:31,949 --> 00:28:32,750
Syd and Mail Gun

682
00:28:32,869 --> 00:28:33,400
and

683
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:36,849
yeah, it would be a pain to get rid of one and just use the other one.

684
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:40,050
And so we have, we have two because they have different capabilities

685
00:28:40,979 --> 00:28:44,329
but some things we just can't get rid of like, again, Adobe or office because

686
00:28:45,939 --> 00:28:48,689
that's it. You got to pay that like sales force, you gotta do that.

687
00:28:49,339 --> 00:28:51,319
And so I was thinking about this in terms of S

688
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,099
bomb and software.

689
00:28:52,109 --> 00:28:54,260
So we've learned from supply chains that for example,

690
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:56,410
if you're building a car and you're missing a few chips,

691
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,150
you can't build a car, right?

692
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,650
Like if you're missing spark plugs, you just,

693
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:05,010
you can't ship 99% of a car by weight and be like, oh yeah, it's mostly there but,

694
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,829
you know, like just hook it up to a tow truck maybe.

695
00:29:08,469 --> 00:29:10,979
And so like, remember there was that I think it was Ford or something,

696
00:29:10,989 --> 00:29:12,949
those Ford expeditions where they were like shipping

697
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,469
without the climate controls in the back.

698
00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:16,900
And then you could come back later and get them installed because

699
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:20,300
they basically kind of tried to make the car as serviceable as possible.

700
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,719
So you could ship them and get some money.

701
00:29:22,189 --> 00:29:26,459
And so I was thinking so traditionally with software, if I build it,

702
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,650
I have and assuming I do a hermetic build,

703
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,800
I have all the bits and I can't kind of like run out of screws

704
00:29:32,189 --> 00:29:32,540
right

705
00:29:33,209 --> 00:29:36,819
now, ignoring people who do builds that involve like a curl something bash

706
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:39,790
where you could run out of those screws. Because what if that site's down that day?

707
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,619
Well, you can't build your software, right?

708
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:41,959
That

709
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:42,160
is

710
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,670
true. And so I was thinking,

711
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,550
but there are

712
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:48,270
analogous situations where, for example,

713
00:29:48,589 --> 00:29:50,310
I am pulling in a piece of software,

714
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:51,890
I need a certain version and it's got a

715
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,390
CV SS severity 10 remotely exploitable flaw in it,

716
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:56,790
right.

717
00:29:57,079 --> 00:29:57,329
Well,

718
00:29:57,339 --> 00:29:59,000
I can't just pull that in and ship it and be

719
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:01,390
vulnerable to that in some cases or maybe I can't.

720
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:04,319
And so there are like I said, analogous situations where

721
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,420
your supply chain gets disrupted

722
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:09,260
and maybe that thing is not available.

723
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:09,390
And,

724
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,040
and the extreme case would be like you're doing a

725
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,109
curl bash thing and that server is not available,

726
00:30:13,609 --> 00:30:16,849
you know, or somebody deletes the package off N PM like left shift.

727
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:19,670
Boom, you know, all the screws are gone and your packages all break

728
00:30:20,339 --> 00:30:21,630
left pad, sorry. Right.

729
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,579
Like somebody deleted all the screws that hold all of N PM together.

730
00:30:25,689 --> 00:30:27,739
It's rare though. So, you know, but

731
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:33,270
-- it can happen.
-- You're not incorrect. I think that's a fair comparative.

732
00:30:33,925 --> 00:30:36,454
And so then that leads to, you know, do we want to give things a fung

733
00:30:36,614 --> 00:30:40,895
il score or like how hard would this be to replace? Like a web server? You know,

734
00:30:41,224 --> 00:30:44,744
depending on how you use the web server, it might be really easy to replace.

735
00:30:44,755 --> 00:30:47,454
Like if it's serving static assets, Engen

736
00:30:47,604 --> 00:30:51,275
X or Apache pick one, I don't care. But if you've built a flask application,

737
00:30:51,444 --> 00:30:53,094
you have a flask application,

738
00:30:53,604 --> 00:30:53,844
right?

739
00:30:53,854 --> 00:30:56,275
You're using Python and there's no way to go

740
00:30:56,285 --> 00:30:59,385
-- around that or
-- if you build it with uh Django

741
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,729
and Django goes away. You.

742
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,910
Well, perfect example web finger dot io, it runs on cloud floor workers.

743
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,079
If I don't have cloud floor workers, I got nothing

744
00:31:08,489 --> 00:31:08,920
like,

745
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,680
I mean, that's been,

746
00:31:10,689 --> 00:31:14,449
that's true of everything and it's always going and that's actually

747
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,329
so Toyota,

748
00:31:16,859 --> 00:31:19,650
what do they call it just in time supply chain or something like that

749
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:20,040
and

750
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:21,430
just in time delivery.

751
00:31:21,459 --> 00:31:25,689
So I was reading some articles about all of the just in time stuff that

752
00:31:25,869 --> 00:31:27,719
Toyota created and they,

753
00:31:27,729 --> 00:31:31,810
they were mocking the fact that the vast majority of companies heard just in time

754
00:31:32,089 --> 00:31:36,010
and then they just stopped keeping inventory of everything. Whereas

755
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,589
the actual

756
00:31:37,699 --> 00:31:40,150
kind of how just in time is supposed to work

757
00:31:40,329 --> 00:31:41,329
is you do exactly.

758
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:43,829
Like you're saying, you determine what the products are,

759
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:46,869
that are commodity and what the products are that are very specialized.

760
00:31:47,229 --> 00:31:50,579
You make sure the specialized stuff you have some buffer room for and

761
00:31:50,589 --> 00:31:53,199
the commodity stuff you're like whatever we can buy screws from anyone.

762
00:31:53,209 --> 00:31:56,099
-- We don't care and,
-- or you can change your process a little bit. Yeah.

763
00:31:56,109 --> 00:31:56,790
Right. Right.

764
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:01,760
And, and I think software is kind of similar, but I also want to say again,

765
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:03,369
coming back to the PS A,

766
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:07,329
this is a very young and new industry.

767
00:32:07,819 --> 00:32:11,010
We talked to Caroline the rust episode and she was, you know, talking about the,

768
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,739
the rail industry taking 80 years to do something.

769
00:32:14,229 --> 00:32:14,469
Oh yeah.

770
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:14,770
To,

771
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:18,180
to change from uh from a localized mechanical brakes to

772
00:32:18,189 --> 00:32:20,369
the air brake system where if the pressure drops,

773
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,250
they all clamp shut.

774
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:21,550
Yeah.

775
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,089
And, and as software as an industry, we're really only what,

776
00:32:25,099 --> 00:32:27,319
20 or 30 years in probably.

777
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:27,689
Well,

778
00:32:27,699 --> 00:32:30,770
-- but
-- we also keep throwing away all the rails we previously had in getting new ones.

779
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,050
Like that's true. That's true.

780
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:36,520
Mainframes used to rule the earth like dinosaurs and now they're in zoos.

781
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:37,569
No, seriously. Right.

782
00:32:37,579 --> 00:32:42,290
Like I remember in 1999 giving a security talk at Vanguard Security Expo

783
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:45,079
where I had to explain like client server programming to

784
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:47,229
these people because they were mainframe people they were like,

785
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,349
we have a computer,

786
00:32:48,489 --> 00:32:53,250
we have dumb terminals or actually now it's dumb terminals running on P CS.

787
00:32:53,719 --> 00:32:57,329
They're like, we only have one computer to deal with. The rest of everything else is

788
00:32:57,469 --> 00:33:01,310
literally the, the most fungible dumb terminal possible.

789
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:03,109
And so now it's like, oh no client server,

790
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:07,650
like the client does some stuff and the server does some stuff and magic TCP/IP.

791
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,560
What's this?

792
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,979
You know, computers plenty.

793
00:33:11,349 --> 00:33:12,949
But that's the thing, right? Like,

794
00:33:13,069 --> 00:33:16,280
I mean, we, we're again on that show with Rust, we're talking about like,

795
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:18,640
we need to throw out C and C++,

796
00:33:19,349 --> 00:33:22,229
we'll ignore the fact that there's several trillion lines

797
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,880
of code by line and dollar value out there though that we have to replace.

798
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:31,050
-- But look,
-- this is the story of Rust though. You don't have to throw it away.

799
00:33:31,339 --> 00:33:33,439
You can slowly make it better

800
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:35,560
but that you're getting rid of that old stuff.

801
00:33:35,739 --> 00:33:37,420
Well, we do have to get rid of the old stuff.

802
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:40,800
But anyway, we're, we're, we're running ourselves out of time here.

803
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,000
So I, I think we should,

804
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:43,959
we should probably clean this one up.

805
00:33:43,969 --> 00:33:46,599
But yeah, I think at the end of the day it's just really, like,

806
00:33:46,969 --> 00:33:50,359
this is all really new and if you don't know what's going on with

807
00:33:50,369 --> 00:33:53,040
that bomb or you've never really heard of it or you don't know what's happening

808
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:56,520
and you think everyone else seems to have, have it all together.

809
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:59,189
They totally don't, no one really knows what's going on.

810
00:33:59,199 --> 00:34:02,079
This is a brand new industry. It's brand new ideas

811
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,709
and anyone who pretends like they have all the answers for you,

812
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:06,500
they're full of crap and don't believe anything.

813
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:06,709
They,

814
00:34:06,849 --> 00:34:08,270
they're trying to sell you something.

815
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,228
Well, probably that, I mean,

816
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,199
and if you need bombs I'll, I'll sell you something. So,

817
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:14,478
it's as

818
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,659
long as they're on desk.

819
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,409
Right. Right.

820
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:21,899
So, anyway, anyway, yeah, I don't know.

821
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:25,280
It's going to be an interesting couple of years I think. And, and I will say I'm,

822
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:29,728
I'm optimistic for where things are going to go. I think we have a lot of work to do.

823
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:33,750
And I think there's a lot of, there's a lot of, kind of wishful thinking

824
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,889
that I think there's people who don't want to do the hard work.

825
00:34:37,899 --> 00:34:41,250
And the only way we get past this is we need to do the hard work.

826
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,478
-- Like there's, there's no plan B,
-- well,

827
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:45,967
and the other thing is we have to do the hard work because we actually have

828
00:34:45,978 --> 00:34:48,478
to experience and figure out what we need and what we don't need and everything.

829
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:51,589
Right. Like, that's why I built a web finger server is because

830
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:53,498
I could write a paper on it. But

831
00:34:53,638 --> 00:34:57,448
I would not have learned seven of the things I did learn by doing it for reals.

832
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,129
100%. 100%. Absolutely.

833
00:35:01,729 --> 00:35:03,389
Payne is the best teacher, Kurt.

834
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:08,969
-- Well,
-- but it's also, there's emergent behaviors and there's, you know, having,

835
00:35:08,979 --> 00:35:12,360
having something to show people is way different than here's a slide deck.

836
00:35:12,629 --> 00:35:14,389
No, here's the thing you can poke at,

837
00:35:14,939 --> 00:35:17,360
you know, get more requests on and, oh, let's,

838
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:20,419
you know, and it came up a Christmas dinner of all things where they're like,

839
00:35:20,429 --> 00:35:21,419
why can't we have email address?

840
00:35:21,429 --> 00:35:24,139
Portability? And I'm like, huh, that is a good question.

841
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:24,800
Right.

842
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:26,620
You know, there's some other anyways.

843
