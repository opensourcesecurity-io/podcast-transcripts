Hello and welcome to episode 76 of the open source security podcast

1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,119
with myself, Kurt

2
00:00:10,239 --> 00:00:12,590
Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime. Josh Pressers.

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,189
Well, the internet's on fire again

4
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:17,100
also. It's 2018.

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,440
It is, those are two things that are true.

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,059
I forget it's not a leap year, right?

7
00:00:22,069 --> 00:00:25,399
Because divisible by four but not 100 but yes to 1000 but not.

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,579
Or is it 2000?

9
00:00:26,979 --> 00:00:27,479
What

10
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:32,159
if it's divisible by four? It's a leap year unless it's divisible by 100.

11
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:33,330
In which case, it's not a leap year.

12
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:38,299
In which case, if it's divisible by 1000 it is a leap year. Hence, 2000 was a leap year.

13
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,259
I think that's the rule.

14
00:00:39,459 --> 00:00:40,939
I can just look at my calendar

15
00:00:41,169 --> 00:00:42,020
and it will tell me.

16
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,860
Well, I know 2018 isn't, I think. Yeah, because 18.

17
00:00:45,569 --> 00:00:46,020
Right.

18
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:47,060
Cool.

19
00:00:47,709 --> 00:00:48,459
We're safe then.

20
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,080
I, I guess, I mean, right. We have enough trouble. We don't need it.

21
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:57,430
-- So,
-- yeah. Yeah. Can you believe it? That am DC pu bug with the certificate processing

22
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,750
that allows remote code execution.

23
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,110
I'm impressed by that one actually.

24
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,489
Yeah. Oh, wait, no, you're talking about that other one.

25
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:08,209
There's, there's been more than one. Right.

26
00:01:08,529 --> 00:01:13,769
So, wait. Ok. So I, I thought, I thought I could buy an A MD processor and I would be safe

27
00:01:13,989 --> 00:01:14,730
and

28
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:16,190
maybe not.

29
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:16,720
Yeah.

30
00:01:16,989 --> 00:01:17,459
Right.

31
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:18,750
Anyway, so,

32
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,930
well, do you? Ok. So for those of you who don't have,

33
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:26,550
oh, I guess for people who just run on raspberry pies and are immune to this,

34
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:27,540
uh,

35
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:32,220
apparently speculative branch prediction and CP

36
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:35,099
US and security are really tricky.

37
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,059
Yes.

38
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:39,919
Who knew?

39
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:41,779
I, I'll be honest,

40
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,980
I'm more shocked that this kind of flaw hasn't become public

41
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,139
before because quite frankly, I mean,

42
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,209
how many gates does the CPU have? Now?

43
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:54,660
It's in an astronomical number.

44
00:01:54,669 --> 00:01:55,419
And actually, you know,

45
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,930
what's really funny about this one is I remember looking at it

46
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,930
and reading about it and thinking like this is really obvious.

47
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:05,569
I'm amazed nobody put the numbers together to figure this out before. Now.

48
00:02:06,089 --> 00:02:07,800
That's actually what really fascinated.

49
00:02:07,809 --> 00:02:11,500
That's one of the top five things that fascinates me about this issue is number one

50
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,559
in one case.

51
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,490
So there's a couple of issues that were found and one

52
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,429
of them was found independently by three different sets of people.

53
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:21,770
And the other issue was found independently by two sets of people.

54
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:23,509
So,

55
00:02:24,029 --> 00:02:29,470
uh and then then there was a speculative thread on Reddit talking about

56
00:02:29,929 --> 00:02:32,270
uh question and whatnot and how essentially

57
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:35,550
uh their theory was that Intel

58
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,210
has allowed this bug to persist,

59
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,350
you know, as long as it's not publicly known

60
00:02:40,649 --> 00:02:43,869
because like it is one heck of a backdoor for

61
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,710
like three letter agencies that want to do targeted attacks.

62
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:48,110
Uh

63
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,050
Me and I don't know about that,

64
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,250
but I feel like

65
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:52,580
no

66
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,460
offense lately,

67
00:02:53,649 --> 00:02:57,039
Google projects are all smart people, these other researchers, very smart people,

68
00:02:57,949 --> 00:03:01,139
like the NSA seriously never looked into this.

69
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,089
I feel like it would be criminally stupid of them not to,

70
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:12,169
to be like, oh, hey, you know, these high fancy amazing CPU features,

71
00:03:12,179 --> 00:03:13,210
maybe they have flaws in them.

72
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,210
We should look into that.

73
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,759
I mean, the NSA used to make their own chips apparently. So

74
00:03:18,029 --> 00:03:20,610
you think they would have some people that know about this stuff?

75
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:23,539
Well, I, I mean, I'm sure they do,

76
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:28,500
but I feel like there's lower hanging fruit it could easily go after

77
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,059
and,

78
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,190
and the other thing is this is kind of a second order

79
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,110
flaw in most cases where by itself it's not necessarily a problem.

80
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:35,779
It's that

81
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,449
the attacker has to get in and then they can

82
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,300
use this to their advantage to do bad things.

83
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,679
And, but

84
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,589
there's a problem now with your comment about the attacker has to get in

85
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:47,839
because

86
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:52,389
so these flaws generally require you to run untrusted code

87
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:55,880
or for the attacker to have exploited something like network wise

88
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,940
to get to run code, right?

89
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:01,539
-- Like like your web browser maybe. And
-- that's the problem.

90
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,539
Now your web browsers are downloading third

91
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,089
party code from literally God knows where because

92
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,869
see the front page of cnn.com or youtube is like

93
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,029
two megabytes and like a third of that is javascript.

94
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,300
Um

95
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:14,759
you know, ad networks and stuff.

96
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:14,979
That's,

97
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:19,350
that's why I block ads is because all that Wonky javascript code being run from.

98
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,220
God knows where

99
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,329
um and just the speed issues. But anyways, that's the problem.

100
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:24,660
Like, so a flaw like this

101
00:04:24,869 --> 00:04:27,519
for a three letter agency would have been amazing because all

102
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:30,100
you would have had to do is like insert some javascript,

103
00:04:30,109 --> 00:04:32,209
you know, obviously in a javascript

104
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:36,220
and you could read the complete contents of an, of a, of a system

105
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,350
memory like

106
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,320
sort of, it's complicated.

107
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:46,679
Well, true, but fundamentally the the attacks are not theoretical, right?

108
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,640
These attacks work, there's working exploit code,

109
00:04:49,809 --> 00:04:52,869
the exploit code works from unprivileged.

110
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:55,989
Like you don't need to be root to run this code.

111
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,760
You, you can just run this code as a user and read all the memory space basically,

112
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:03,869
which is neat.

113
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:05,959
And it was about in the one case,

114
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,029
what they were saying it was about 2000 bits per second which ain't super fast.

115
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,670
But I mean,

116
00:05:10,739 --> 00:05:11,250
it's good.

117
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,119
It's pretty good man.

118
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,230
I mean, especially when you probably don't have to really babysit it,

119
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:17,140
-- it'll
-- just do its business

120
00:05:17,869 --> 00:05:20,459
is sequential and you can control it to some degree, right? Like

121
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,579
there's been a lot of Linux kernel memory leaks where

122
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,899
it's like they can read like four kilobytes of memory,

123
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,190
but they can't control what it is.

124
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,149
It's just totally random

125
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,970
in which case that's not great.

126
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:31,309
And it's, you know,

127
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,049
it's difficult to exploit but when you can control what's being read.

128
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:36,299
Well, yeah, I mean,

129
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:37,149
yeah,

130
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,660
that's all about what encryption keys, passwords, you name it.

131
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:41,760
Yeah. Right. Right.

132
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:46,690
And actually you remind me speaking of what, 22 K a second or whatever, uh,

133
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:51,589
there was somebody dumped the PS four kernel and it took six days

134
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,559
because they could read like 600 bytes or something at a time.

135
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,230
It was crazy.

136
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,000
But anyway, and, and that's the thing. Right?

137
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:03,149
Is time, is irrelevant in my honest opinion because I think if you have

138
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:09,470
-- on like reddit or CNN or something
-- constantly. Absolutely. Like. Right.

139
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,269
Yep. Yep.

140
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:12,850
-- I, I know
-- the whole point with those crypto miners

141
00:06:13,049 --> 00:06:14,119
that insert crypto

142
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:16,429
currency mining javascript.

143
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:17,869
Yeah. Right.

144
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:21,910
Right. That only works because people leave tabs open for like, ever, like,

145
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,269
uh 24. I don't even know how many tabs I've opened. It's a bunch.

146
00:06:25,309 --> 00:06:27,519
I probably can't count that high

147
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,570
and I rebooted the other day.

148
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:34,890
Here's what really fascinates me is, this is a really,

149
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:36,070
like,

150
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:38,910
this is a really solid set of technical flaws like that

151
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,829
are actually useful for bad guys to do bad things.

152
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:44,390
And you know what? I honestly don't really care that much

153
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,809
-- because you know what I
-- find an assisted

154
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:48,230
man.

155
00:06:48,489 --> 00:06:53,429
Well, I am but it's not my problem. But you know what I'm really fascinated by is in

156
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,859
this case,

157
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,299
the cure is potentially far worse than the disease.

158
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,000
Uh Yes. And, and I think, why don't we, why don't we start with,

159
00:07:03,619 --> 00:07:06,380
we're not interested in talking about kind

160
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,600
of the deep down scary technical details.

161
00:07:08,609 --> 00:07:11,679
-- If you want those, go somewhere else,
-- go to Google's blog.

162
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,709
Right. Yeah, that's true. It's, it's actually very well written

163
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:19,600
but there's so many other crazy things about this issue to talk about and,

164
00:07:19,609 --> 00:07:23,859
and I think starting with the cure is a great place because I, I agree with you.

165
00:07:23,869 --> 00:07:26,899
There are going to be organizations where

166
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:31,820
applying the, I guess the, the slowness they will get the performance hit

167
00:07:32,059 --> 00:07:34,980
will outweigh the potential security impact.

168
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:39,459
Right? Because, because let's face it if you think about it as, as a cost

169
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,160
where a performance impact has a very dollar centric cost, right? Or, or

170
00:07:45,059 --> 00:07:45,500
to say,

171
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,140
right. Whereas getting hacked,

172
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:51,339
what are they going to get? Right. What are you going to,

173
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,059
what is, what is, how is it going to damage your business? Right. That too. Exactly.

174
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,649
I mean, let's face it. Right. The

175
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,170
great is a great example because

176
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,459
you think like Transunion and all those other companies aren't just as bad.

177
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,350
Oh. Right. Yeah,

178
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,619
that's like even all the, all the people saying, oh,

179
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:10,859
we should all buy a MD processors now and it's like, I, I bet you buy black hat

180
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,890
someone has figured out how to do this on A MD chips.

181
00:08:14,179 --> 00:08:14,589
I mean,

182
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,410
I mean, they already did that on Wednesday. I mean, there was the, what is it?

183
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,500
Um

184
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:25,190
the uh remote code execution via crafted uh EK certificate in AM DS.

185
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,160
Uh They have this thing called trust zone

186
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:28,820
that provides

187
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:33,580
basically it's like part of the trusted platform management T PM stuff, blah, blah,

188
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,099
blah, long story short

189
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,400
parsing certificates is tricky like it legit.

190
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:42,159
I mean, I dare anybody to go read the A SN one or X 509 standards.

191
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,599
Oh man, it's brutal. It's so complicated.

192
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:49,210
And so anyways uh point being you feed this thing a certificate,

193
00:08:49,219 --> 00:08:50,380
you get code execution

194
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:53,150
straight up. But here's the difference, right?

195
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:59,130
99.9% of security flaws, the resolution boils down to here's a code patch boom done,

196
00:08:59,140 --> 00:08:59,369
right?

197
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,159
And there's no,

198
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:04,650
there's almost never any like severe weirdness or performance hit. And

199
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,450
in the few cases where there are typically what will happen is either like, oh,

200
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,000
we have to like kill that feature because it's really terrible.

201
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,640
So we just can't do that anymore.

202
00:09:12,809 --> 00:09:16,010
So we're gonna like break backwards compatibility to some degree, you know,

203
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:20,099
like a great example being SSL, we just, we can't fix SSL,

204
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,760
right? It's just so broken at this point.

205
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:27,080
The the solution is go deploy TL SS 1.1 or later

206
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:28,309
like straight up,

207
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:28,840
right?

208
00:09:29,789 --> 00:09:30,159
Um

209
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,989
The other case like a great example is shell shock, right? Remember shell shock,

210
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:37,900
it was a, it was a bug and Bash introduced in 1995.

211
00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:42,299
So again, kind of like the CPU bug and that it affected like everything since ever.

212
00:09:42,309 --> 00:09:43,719
That's kind of the first big problem.

213
00:09:43,729 --> 00:09:46,140
The second problem is it was super trivial to exploit, right?

214
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,340
Like somebody tweeted out

215
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,520
a working exploit code in a tweet

216
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,609
and then we went through that whole like, oh, we're going to fix it.

217
00:09:52,619 --> 00:09:55,090
We're going to fix it this way, didn't quite fix it it that way.

218
00:09:55,099 --> 00:09:57,400
And we ended up having to break some backwards compatibility

219
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,919
and fundamentally it didn't matter that much.

220
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:01,159
No

221
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,270
funny enough.

222
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,500
The the story behind shell shock is upstream released a

223
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:12,200
couple of patches trying to avoid breaking backwards compatibility.

224
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,760
And in fact, it didn't work. And at the end

225
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,679
after wasting days of people's time,

226
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,080
they ended up releasing a patch that broke backwards

227
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,510
compatibility because it was the only way to fix it

228
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:24,250
and the confusion

229
00:10:24,969 --> 00:10:25,969
because there was multiple CV

230
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:31,520
S and there were new CV S being issued and oh, it was a gigantic cluster kerfuffle.

231
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:34,299
And um this is a family show, right?

232
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:38,150
Although please don't let your Children listen to this. That's, that's cruel.

233
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,419
-- Yeah. Don't, don't make anyone
-- do that.

234
00:10:40,469 --> 00:10:42,960
But anyways and so like even in a case like shell shock,

235
00:10:42,969 --> 00:10:45,900
which is a great example because I mean, it it was a mess,

236
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:47,590
it was backwards compatibility or

237
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:48,520
um,

238
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:51,320
like some of the SSL TLS stuff like where it's

239
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:54,130
just literally there is no answer other than to like,

240
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,239
OK, we got to deprecate SSL straight up.

241
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,789
That's all, that's the answer.

242
00:10:58,359 --> 00:11:00,070
Um, life goes on, right.

243
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:05,150
Like it's, you apply, like you get a source code or a binary patch from your vendor,

244
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:07,659
you apply it, you reboot or you don't reboot whatever

245
00:11:07,979 --> 00:11:08,609
and you're done.

246
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,630
Right. That's, that's basically it.

247
00:11:10,849 --> 00:11:11,450
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah.

248
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:15,460
-- In most cases,
-- and in this case, the problem is, I mean, the there,

249
00:11:15,469 --> 00:11:16,590
there's basically two solutions.

250
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:20,299
Either you apply the workaround patch, fix whatever in software

251
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,179
or

252
00:11:21,609 --> 00:11:24,030
you like buy new hardware.

253
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:24,849
But,

254
00:11:24,859 --> 00:11:30,570
but here's the beauty of it is Intel even shipping chips today that are immune to this

255
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:37,030
uh aren't they still shipping atoms that don't have this capability?

256
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:38,799
I believe the Intel

257
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:39,440
atom

258
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,950
or maybe those are the older ones I'm thinking of,

259
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:45,190
but they didn't have speculative branch prediction. So they're just

260
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,549
no harm, no foul, just like Raspberry Pi.

261
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:51,770
The Raspberry Pi is such a simple CPU. It's just not affected.

262
00:11:51,969 --> 00:11:52,590
I love it.

263
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:58,359
But here, although did you read the, the cert

264
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:01,239
advice was to replace your CPU

265
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,880
patching, that's for chumps, just buy a new computer.

266
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:09,549
Well, and, and here's the thing that gets me replace your CPU with what even if Intel

267
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,150
somehow magically like for the sake

268
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,530
of argument tripled their manufacturing capacity.

269
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,219
That still wouldn't be enough.

270
00:12:17,609 --> 00:12:17,940
Right.

271
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:18,500
Right.

272
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:21,130
There's literally just not enough, you know.

273
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,929
And this is what kind of worries me about the IOT.

274
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,580
It's like everybody go replace your toaster. But with what?

275
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,119
With a new toaster, a stick and fire

276
00:12:30,109 --> 00:12:30,580
like,

277
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:33,140
yeah, I've got a kitchen torch now, so I've got a plan B

278
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,090
-- right.
-- There you go. There you go.

279
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,799
Awesome. So,

280
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:38,359
yeah, so,

281
00:12:38,609 --> 00:12:41,320
yeah, realistically replacing hardware is not

282
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,679
-- an option other than like,
-- completely ridiculous

283
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:43,869
to,

284
00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:45,679
unless you maybe

285
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:50,619
decide to switch from Intel to a MD going forwards and like after three years of

286
00:12:50,909 --> 00:12:53,479
amortization and replacing everything you're, you're done.

287
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:57,070
But yeah, so you got to apply this uh the software patches that,

288
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,419
you know,

289
00:12:58,429 --> 00:12:59,650
depending on what kind of CIS calls and

290
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:02,049
whatever you're doing have uh an impact performance

291
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:08,020
of between like zero and like 30 or 50% with sort of an average around 5%

292
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:12,460
which doesn't sound terrible. And honestly, like for desktop ain't that bad. But

293
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:15,539
when you think about servers and a data center and like, just

294
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:21,719
like losing 5% of your CPU capacity or conversely in increasing your

295
00:13:21,729 --> 00:13:25,539
CPU capacity by 5% and thus cooling and all that by 5%.

296
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:31,809
-- Like Amazon, I mean, that is a major, major amount of money.
-- Right. Right.

297
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,520
Well, you've got to imagine the likes of Amazon or Google or Facebook or whoever.

298
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:37,369
Well,

299
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,679
they probably have so many CP us that if they wanted

300
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,109
to replace them all say in the next two years,

301
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:44,070
they couldn't

302
00:13:44,369 --> 00:13:44,960
under any,

303
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,830
they probably do replace a lot of it on a 2 to 3 year cycle because

304
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:52,309
the newer CP US are so much more energy efficient, they'll pay for themselves.

305
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,919
It's like S sds in the data center

306
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,349
literally will pay for themselves in six months or less

307
00:13:56,359 --> 00:13:59,229
because of the cooling requirements are so much lower.

308
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:00,679
-- Ok. I mean,
-- that's

309
00:14:01,359 --> 00:14:04,150
the other thing to remember too is so a company like Facebook

310
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:07,590
will have to eat that cost because the CP US are slow.

311
00:14:07,789 --> 00:14:11,520
But a company like Amazon web services, like my web server is 5% slower.

312
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,919
So that means I got to go spend

313
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,179
and buy 5% more web servers.

314
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:18,400
-- Yeah. Right.
-- So Amazon is not going to eat that cost.

315
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:22,250
No, no, absolutely not. And in fact, I read a thing on I

316
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,820
was hacker news or reddit. I think, I think you sent it to me

317
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,390
where someone was talking about.

318
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,739
They had their Amazon reserved instances and now essentially they,

319
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,380
they paid ahead for less than they're getting.

320
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:33,789
I

321
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,380
mean, that, that's

322
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:34,599
interesting

323
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:35,789
to think about.

324
00:14:35,969 --> 00:14:36,219
Yeah.

325
00:14:36,469 --> 00:14:39,669
Well, and that's the second big issue around this flaw.

326
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,390
That is most fascinating to me is that

327
00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:45,270
for probably the first time in the history of computing

328
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:49,039
history, we actually have a security event

329
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,380
with a confirmable amount of loss in the billions.

330
00:14:53,549 --> 00:14:55,690
It's Intel's market share stock.

331
00:14:56,299 --> 00:14:59,729
Yeah, market cap, sorry, not market share. Intel's market cap dropped.

332
00:14:59,739 --> 00:15:01,950
Something like, what was it? $6 billion

333
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:05,260
and A MD went up about a half a billion. I think it was.

334
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,599
Um, I was also quite shocked about the, the,

335
00:15:08,609 --> 00:15:11,640
the difference in market caps Intel is like 210 billion.

336
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,059
A MD is like 11

337
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,440
A MD is significantly smaller than Intel.

338
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:20,739
But I, you know, I read it, I read a statistic once about kind of companies

339
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:25,320
and generally speaking, whoever is in first place commands 80% of the market,

340
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:28,229
whoever's in second place usually has 10 to 15%.

341
00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:30,400
And then it's just scraps after that.

342
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,789
And I mean, that's totally the processor market today, right?

343
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:34,270
And,

344
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,469
and that's kind of what led to this is that Intel does

345
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:39,799
amazing stuff like speculative branch prediction which like gives you a,

346
00:15:39,869 --> 00:15:39,880
a

347
00:15:40,349 --> 00:15:42,669
pretty significant boost in performance,

348
00:15:43,469 --> 00:15:47,969
like for real, you know, like this is not a half a percent more CPU gum.

349
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:52,090
Like it's a, you know, it's a pretty good amount of improvement

350
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,989
because Intel is basically doing voodoo

351
00:15:55,169 --> 00:15:56,109
in the CPU.

352
00:15:56,219 --> 00:15:57,210
-- Like
-- it's their voodoo,

353
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,349
it's magic.

354
00:15:58,909 --> 00:15:59,119
OK.

355
00:15:59,229 --> 00:16:00,020
Sorry magic.

356
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,419
You know,

357
00:16:01,859 --> 00:16:04,250
um like they're, they're basically saying like, oh,

358
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,900
we probably know what your program is gonna do.

359
00:16:05,909 --> 00:16:08,099
So we're gonna go do that and if it turns out it's wrong,

360
00:16:08,109 --> 00:16:10,780
we'll like somehow magically unwind it and then do the right thing.

361
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:14,140
Uh No, it's, that, that part's actually easy.

362
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,340
I mean, branch prediction isn't, isn't new.

363
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:19,020
You, you just basically when you hit the branch,

364
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:22,409
if, if what, what happens isn't what you thought it was,

365
00:16:22,419 --> 00:16:25,409
you just dump the pipeline and, and let it run from there.

366
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,469
It's that part's actually really well

367
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:30,460
because I did, I was in, in college

368
00:16:31,369 --> 00:16:31,900
in

369
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:33,659
man, it would have been

370
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,119
99 maybe 2000 somewhere in there.

371
00:16:37,659 --> 00:16:41,419
And, and I took a processor design course and like we talked about

372
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,419
doing the, the brand prediction stuff and how it works.

373
00:16:44,429 --> 00:16:46,330
And obviously we designed a trivial one that

374
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,619
was basically it guessed for the most part,

375
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,460
you know, we didn't actually do anything interesting.

376
00:16:50,849 --> 00:16:52,299
But you figure in

377
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:56,219
if you guess your 50% chance, right?

378
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:00,090
I mean, practically speaking, obviously Intel does better than that.

379
00:17:00,099 --> 00:17:01,640
So my guess is they're probably somewhere in

380
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:04,118
the high seventies in terms of R prediction.

381
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:04,439
But

382
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,848
you get the idea.

383
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:07,509
Yeah.

384
00:17:07,698 --> 00:17:09,698
No. And um so yeah, I mean,

385
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:14,140
to me that just the fact that we can actually quantify

386
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,219
to some degree the actual loss from this in, in

387
00:17:18,348 --> 00:17:19,790
the form of the stock market,

388
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,848
I don't think that's really happened before.

389
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:25,520
Maybe not. I, I don't know, I feel like the answer is no,

390
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,599
but I, I also have a suspicion

391
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:32,489
that in, in like three months, Intel stock will be fine.

392
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,390
Well, you know, this whole thing reminds me of the Equifax thing with the whole,

393
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,979
like we're shocked, this is terrible blah, blah, blah.

394
00:17:37,989 --> 00:17:40,030
But what are you going to do not use Equifax

395
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:40,959
is

396
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,430
you and I can not use them. We

397
00:17:42,689 --> 00:17:42,739
just

398
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:44,469
data points to them. Right.

399
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,469
And all their existing large contracts are locked in for

400
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:49,119
God knows how long and they're buying that stuff.

401
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:49,550
Like

402
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:54,660
you can't just switch CPU providers like overnight because more to the point,

403
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,689
even if a MD wanted to service

404
00:17:57,099 --> 00:17:59,670
this market, they, they, they can't, they, I mean,

405
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,680
they can't magically turn out 10 times as many CP us tomorrow.

406
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,189
Yeah.

407
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:05,359
Right. Well, and not only that, like,

408
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:11,550
I, I don't want to drop a grand on a new CPU tomorrow. Right.

409
00:18:11,729 --> 00:18:12,739
So I'm gonna live with it.

410
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:16,040
Well, you'd also need a new motherboard.

411
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,520
Probably different ra M and then that means, like,

412
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,160
physically swapping everything, which

413
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:24,650
is a pain for you and me. But when you think about somebody like Amazon, oh, sweet.

414
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,020
Like

415
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,849
I was actually talking with somebody. It was funny because they were,

416
00:18:29,089 --> 00:18:31,900
they had a problem with auditors at the data center because their auditors, like,

417
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:35,010
we want to see how you build a server and they're like, but we don't like

418
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,180
racks come in, they're shrink wrapped. We like unshrink, wrap them and like,

419
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:46,140
there's like a fiber plug thing and like a power, well, two power plug things

420
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,709
and like, and then the guy, like,

421
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,869
you know, he slots it in jams in a couple of plugs and like,

422
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,280
that's it. Like he walks away from it.

423
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:58,219
Like he's not installing stuff or touching stuff or like turning screws,

424
00:18:58,229 --> 00:19:02,469
like at that scale, you know, you have a semi truck back up to your loading bay

425
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,119
and a guy with a forklift,

426
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:05,040
man,

427
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,680
I remember building out racks and it took more than

428
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:10,199
a day usually to fill a rack with one use

429
00:19:11,949 --> 00:19:12,099
because

430
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:12,319
I mean,

431
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:16,489
well, well, not just that, well, the screws

432
00:19:16,609 --> 00:19:16,890
you

433
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,150
have

434
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,849
to screw because I remember,

435
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:21,760
I remember the time I built a rack full of one use

436
00:19:21,939 --> 00:19:24,650
we got in a rack which is empty and then there

437
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,520
were rails and there were screws and you had to first

438
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,750
put in the screw the rails and then you had to

439
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,839
attach the server to the rails and then put it in.

440
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:36,170
And then when you were done installing, what is it like? 46?

441
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,430
I don't even remember how many it is. It's a freaking lot.

442
00:19:38,949 --> 00:19:40,050
Right. When you're done with

443
00:19:40,489 --> 00:19:40,719
40

444
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,109
-- 75 inches
-- each.

445
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,400
Ok. Right. Right.

446
00:19:43,739 --> 00:19:44,270
-- And
-- then you have

447
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:44,430
to

448
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:44,819
memories

449
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:45,270
or anything.

450
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,069
I thankfully have forgotten. So I consider that an accomplishment.

451
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,329
But then you have to wire the stupid things up too.

452
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:51,790
Right.

453
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,569
-- Do you remember
-- wires,

454
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,800
Facebook and all these guys came out with their open rack specification

455
00:19:57,199 --> 00:19:58,859
and part of it was straight up,

456
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:00,660
there's like two or three copper bars in the

457
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,689
back that you don't touch because they're running like,

458
00:20:02,699 --> 00:20:05,599
what was it like 48 volts at like

459
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,599
100 amps or something stupid?

460
00:20:08,459 --> 00:20:12,000
And like, there's just clips to, like, on the back for the power, you know,

461
00:20:12,209 --> 00:20:15,709
and, and when I read that I'm like, that sounds ridiculously dangerous and

462
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:15,969
to

463
00:20:16,489 --> 00:20:17,199
open them up.

464
00:20:17,439 --> 00:20:18,250
I mean, well,

465
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,099
more to the point you shouldn't be sticking your arm into the back of a rack.

466
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,130
Right. Right.

467
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,849
Well, I'm, I'm trying to think.

468
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:29,439
II, I don't remember dealing with, with broken machines in a rack very often.

469
00:20:29,449 --> 00:20:30,619
Like, if it broke,

470
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,420
you probably just stopped using it

471
00:20:32,609 --> 00:20:34,670
because it wasn't worth the pain and suffering of

472
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,699
taking the stupid thing out in most cases.

473
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,140
My favorite was because I bought some really cheap cases that didn't, like,

474
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,119
fit properly.

475
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,550
Uh, I had a one u acting as a shelf and that one you died and of course,

476
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,739
I couldn't replace it because it was a shelf.

477
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,180
Right.

478
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,619
Leave it in, it's fine.

479
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,660
It's structural

480
00:20:52,979 --> 00:20:54,560
actually. You know, you know what else? I remember?

481
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:58,069
I remember one time I put together a rack, it was Dell Servers.

482
00:20:58,079 --> 00:20:59,760
A Dell rack, like Dell everything

483
00:20:59,979 --> 00:21:03,339
and the fricking machines didn't fit. It's like, come on guys.

484
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:06,199
-- This is the only reason. Well, it's
-- like IKEA,

485
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:10,560
IKEA has cutlery trays and cutlery and they don't fit together

486
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,920
like the freaking, the short part is too short for their spoons and forks. Oh,

487
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,310
my goodness. It's off by like, half an inch. It's, it's awesome.

488
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:18,459
It

489
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,040
makes me so angry

490
00:21:20,439 --> 00:21:22,219
and that is the world we live in.

491
00:21:22,459 --> 00:21:24,430
Yeah. Going back to this. So, I mean,

492
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:27,550
what's really like what I find so fascinating is that

493
00:21:28,699 --> 00:21:32,969
you've got this directly quantifiable cost of a having to install a patch,

494
00:21:32,979 --> 00:21:34,000
having to reboot.

495
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,640
Um The best part too is this patch.

496
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,589
It's not just like,

497
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:40,209
oh install it on the bare metal and you're good to go like a

498
00:21:40,219 --> 00:21:44,380
lot of like CPU microcode updates where you update the CPU microcode and you're done

499
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:47,520
or you update the underlying operating system and you're done.

500
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,560
No, like in this case, you have to update

501
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,390
the underlying operating system,

502
00:21:51,939 --> 00:21:55,010
you may or may not have to update the micro code in the CPU as well.

503
00:21:55,609 --> 00:21:58,290
And then you may or may not have to also update your V MS

504
00:21:58,930 --> 00:21:59,979
like with kernels

505
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:04,229
because of the way virtualization and CCU shenanigans work,

506
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,459
just update everything.

507
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:08,099
-- Exactly.
-- I mean, don't, don't try to guess.

508
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:08,650
Yeah.

509
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:09,609
Um

510
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:13,630
and then like you said, I mean, part of it too is like how bad this is this going to be?

511
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:13,839
You know,

512
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:18,780
you might have a database workload which hits that magic 30% performance impact

513
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,189
in which case like, wow, I, I don't have advice for you.

514
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:27,449
Like I literally don't know what to tell people with that problem, you know,

515
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,119
and, and well, you know, I mean, I I'm at elastic and obviously we,

516
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:36,489
we have workloads that are crazy, crazy write and read dependent,

517
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,489
which can have a hit.

518
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,199
And so like this is something we're,

519
00:22:41,209 --> 00:22:43,920
we're doing some significant investigation into now is,

520
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:47,369
is we want to understand exactly what this performance impact means

521
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:50,520
because it, it is going to matter to some people. Right.

522
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:53,380
Well, I, I'm just thinking how much did you guys spend,

523
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:56,089
say optimizing elastic to be 10 or 20% faster?

524
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,530
There's people that, that's their job.

525
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:03,219
I bet they're curled up in a ball crying right now because

526
00:23:03,229 --> 00:23:05,810
all that work they did is just potentially out the window.

527
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:10,969
It's not out the window, it will. Ok. So here's, I see this as two

528
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:11,719
sided,

529
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,089
there's like people like us,

530
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:20,209
we now have room for extra optimizations because we, if we can find ways to, to hit

531
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,000
the disc less

532
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:25,660
we will gain speed, right? We will gain significant speed.

533
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,680
Well, I shouldn't say gain, we get it back right?

534
00:23:27,689 --> 00:23:29,560
Because you're not really gaining it recover, uh

535
00:23:29,739 --> 00:23:30,790
sure recover.

536
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,689
But in, in all, additionally, kind of from the operating system level,

537
00:23:34,699 --> 00:23:38,689
we're at a point again where people can do some clever things to gain that speed back.

538
00:23:38,699 --> 00:23:40,890
And I, I honestly fully expect

539
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:42,510
that in a couple of years,

540
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,650
the kernel will have found ways to get the vast majority of the speed back.

541
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,890
-- I really do think
-- that and that raises a third topic.

542
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:54,479
I'm really, I've been thinking about is how long are we going to be stuck with

543
00:23:54,609 --> 00:23:57,479
this performance? Hit security fix?

544
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,500
Like are we at some point in five or 10 years going to say,

545
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:04,339
ok, everybody should have upgraded their CPU by now.

546
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,050
You know,

547
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,170
the Linux kernel is now taking away

548
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,880
this performance penalty penalty security patch.

549
00:24:09,939 --> 00:24:12,199
Oh, man, I wonder if they'd ever do that?

550
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:16,099
Well, I, I feel like we've never had

551
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:20,979
a security update with this broad of a performance impact.

552
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:21,579
Um,

553
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,239
no, no. You know what else though?

554
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:27,420
I mean, so the way that the patch works is if you're running an A MD system,

555
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:30,430
it just doesn't do the, the page table isolation, right?

556
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:31,849
And, and I,

557
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,380
I don't know about Windows or Mac or whatever.

558
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,579
Yeah, I can't speak for them,

559
00:24:36,589 --> 00:24:38,880
but we'll just focus on Linux because that's what we know.

560
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:40,020
Now,

561
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,979
I would imagine eventually Intel might have a chip they produce,

562
00:24:43,989 --> 00:24:46,469
that doesn't suffer from this, which means, you know,

563
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:49,500
conceivably you could look for that chip during boot and,

564
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:52,369
and re enable or I guess not re enable, but don't,

565
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:55,459
don't turn on the page table isolation patch, right?

566
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:59,270
Well, my understanding was that

567
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:02,430
Intel was looking to ship

568
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:06,949
CP US that don't have this flaw or work around this flaw,

569
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:07,790
-- you
-- know,

570
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:08,219
they,

571
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:11,849
they fix the flaw without the performance impact because

572
00:25:12,099 --> 00:25:13,780
the thing is Mac Os.

573
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:15,770
Yeah, it's, it's with the PC ID,

574
00:25:15,949 --> 00:25:17,010
Intel, hang on a second

575
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,239
PC ID

576
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:20,670
because my understanding is with Mac Os

577
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,849
running on more recent

578
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:26,239
uh Intel CP US that have the PC ID stuff.

579
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,560
There's like no performance hit

580
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:32,599
and there's some, I have it on my, my desktop and

581
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,890
if I do certain things, I see it,

582
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:40,140
like, like my audio editor for actually how I edit this podcast.

583
00:25:40,469 --> 00:25:41,819
I, after I upgraded,

584
00:25:41,829 --> 00:25:44,969
I spent some time fiddling with things and like when I start Chrome,

585
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:48,979
I, I know it's, it's significantly slower, but when I start Chrome,

586
00:25:48,989 --> 00:25:51,209
it generally opens like 100 and 50 tabs.

587
00:25:51,959 --> 00:25:56,089
And so it's doing a bunch of crazy stuff and, and the audio when I edit audio,

588
00:25:56,099 --> 00:25:58,689
when I run certain operations and now mind you

589
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,890
the way audacity kind of deals with things is,

590
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:05,290
is every episode of this podcast will have

591
00:26:05,619 --> 00:26:10,199
like probably tens of thousands of files in, in directories.

592
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,280
That's how they kind of do it. They split it up into teeny tiny chunks

593
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,170
and, and that is not a happy place right now

594
00:26:17,439 --> 00:26:18,930
when I'm, when I'm doing stuff.

595
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,810
But yeah, my understanding is, is dis

596
00:26:20,969 --> 00:26:23,329
IO especially SSD dis

597
00:26:23,489 --> 00:26:24,469
IO is,

598
00:26:24,589 --> 00:26:28,050
is one of the major problem cases here with this solution.

599
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:28,630
Yeah.

600
00:26:28,739 --> 00:26:29,109
Right.

601
00:26:29,329 --> 00:26:29,939
But yeah. No.

602
00:26:29,949 --> 00:26:34,300
So well, and speaking of which you mentioned, we're going to talk about Linux only.

603
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,939
I also wanted to talk about Microsoft because

604
00:26:37,589 --> 00:26:39,979
um apparently so

605
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:43,219
Microsoft in order to fix this had to like

606
00:26:43,229 --> 00:26:48,140
significantly rewrite and monkey with a whole pile of

607
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,719
in like internal memory management stuff

608
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:55,099
so much so that like most A V software will basically poop itself.

609
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:55,699
No,

610
00:26:55,859 --> 00:26:59,449
no, it doesn't poop itself. It gives you a blue screen of death.

611
00:26:59,459 --> 00:27:02,410
It sounds like your machine becomes unusable, right?

612
00:27:02,689 --> 00:27:05,510
You get that lovely air that I haven't seen in forever. Thank goodness.

613
00:27:05,699 --> 00:27:06,540
You know where it's like,

614
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,209
call your system administrator and tell him this

615
00:27:08,219 --> 00:27:09,930
magic number and he's going to be like,

616
00:27:09,939 --> 00:27:11,089
what are you talking about?

617
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,609
That's how bo work, right?

618
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:12,979
I

619
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:13,520
know.

620
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:13,829
I

621
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:14,099
know.

622
00:27:14,209 --> 00:27:15,010
And um

623
00:27:15,229 --> 00:27:20,439
so there essentially is this registry key that your antivirus software

624
00:27:20,449 --> 00:27:22,849
is supposed to set if it's compatible with the update?

625
00:27:23,939 --> 00:27:25,270
Cool. But

626
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,510
what I'm not clear on is,

627
00:27:27,739 --> 00:27:28,699
well, number one,

628
00:27:28,709 --> 00:27:30,750
if you have really crappy a V that never sets it at

629
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,689
some point is Microsoft going to force this update down your throat.

630
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,469
And number two,

631
00:27:35,949 --> 00:27:40,349
-- what if you don't have a V
-- software? Everyone has a V software now.

632
00:27:40,449 --> 00:27:43,479
And that was my second thought is that if you don't have a V software,

633
00:27:43,489 --> 00:27:46,109
then either you better know what you're doing and set this

634
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:49,689
key manually or be like you're so far up the creek,

635
00:27:49,699 --> 00:27:50,310
it don't matter

636
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,160
basically. Right.

637
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:56,989
Well, no, if you, if you don't have a V software, you have Windows defender now,

638
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:00,469
I don't think you can get away from it. Like you're running a V,

639
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:02,849
-- you don't have a choice.
-- I was going to test that.

640
00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:05,989
I have one last little laptop running Windows 10 that I was gonna,

641
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:08,229
I was trying to, I guess if I take it off the network,

642
00:28:08,239 --> 00:28:11,800
I can remove windows defender and then reboot it and see if the update hits.

643
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:12,069
But

644
00:28:12,209 --> 00:28:16,010
I wanted to try that out or if one of our listeners knows, uh, or anyways,

645
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,630
we'll google it.

646
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:18,670
But I'm, I'm just curious because

647
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:20,609
this is definitely going to be something that

648
00:28:20,619 --> 00:28:22,810
people are going to be looking to exploit,

649
00:28:22,819 --> 00:28:23,339
especially by.

650
00:28:23,349 --> 00:28:25,109
I mean, if you, if

651
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,739
the moment somebody writes a working javascript exploit for this,

652
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,390
right? People are going to be like, oh, this is awesome. I love this.

653
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,630
I can like go spy on people that are like looking on my website or,

654
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:39,829
you know, uh via ads or whatever and, you know, they're gonna do it because I,

655
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:41,989
I'm kind of tempted to, to be honest.

656
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:46,150
Um, you know, it's cool like you get to look in people's computers.

657
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:47,709
So I'm kind of wondering like,

658
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:52,380
again, you know, what's the patch up take going to be like, I love that Mac Os just

659
00:28:52,569 --> 00:28:55,609
kind of silently fixed it. Apparently. What? Back in December,

660
00:28:56,209 --> 00:28:58,500
-- that's what it sounds like,
-- you know,

661
00:28:58,589 --> 00:29:02,300
kind of like Amazon with their rolling reboots where it's like, uh yeah,

662
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,140
performance sucks now, sorry about that,

663
00:29:04,479 --> 00:29:05,000
you know,

664
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:05,969
um

665
00:29:06,229 --> 00:29:06,589
Amazon

666
00:29:06,709 --> 00:29:09,579
like I love that I got, this is what also gets me is no,

667
00:29:09,589 --> 00:29:12,750
like I am shocked this issue didn't leak sooner because

668
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,459
it was found in June,

669
00:29:14,689 --> 00:29:15,699
they told Intel

670
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:19,189
and like people have been working on this for several months.

671
00:29:19,199 --> 00:29:23,380
So this is a perfect example of one of the very few issues

672
00:29:23,609 --> 00:29:27,500
every year that actually needs what I would call like a proper embargo.

673
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:30,699
I'm not talking like a, like a four day or a one or a two week embargo,

674
00:29:30,709 --> 00:29:32,109
but I'm talking like an embargo

675
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,739
where like you, you kind of

676
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,729
like, what's the longest we can push this embargo?

677
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:41,469
So we have as much engineering and testing and QE time as possible

678
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:44,150
so that we can make sure we get this done right? Because

679
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:47,280
like shell shock, I mean, shell shock, not getting that right.

680
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:49,439
Whatever it was ugly, people reapplied patches.

681
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:52,560
But like this is every single,

682
00:29:52,739 --> 00:29:54,920
it's basically every single server on the planet, right?

683
00:29:55,349 --> 00:29:57,369
Except for like my raspberry pie in the basement

684
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,209
and more to the point, I mean,

685
00:30:00,219 --> 00:30:04,699
the the amount of stress and confusion and annoyance it would have.

686
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,109
Yeah, it just

687
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:06,969
so much.

688
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,660
And so

689
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:11,229
there was an embargo that lasted and it was supposed

690
00:30:11,239 --> 00:30:13,900
to go for about another week but it leaked early.

691
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:14,819
I don't know why.

692
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:16,699
Um I have my thoughts,

693
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:17,459
people

694
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:17,680
figure

695
00:30:17,829 --> 00:30:17,869
out,

696
00:30:17,979 --> 00:30:18,010
no,

697
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:22,819
no, I I can explain that one actually because I mean, you were on the inside,

698
00:30:22,829 --> 00:30:24,420
but I was totally on the outside.

699
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:27,959
And what ended up happening was there were patches

700
00:30:28,189 --> 00:30:30,140
that went into the Linux kernel.

701
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:33,099
-- Was
-- it actually just the A MD commit from the 20 ninth?

702
00:30:33,349 --> 00:30:35,530
No, that was what sealed the deal.

703
00:30:35,849 --> 00:30:41,760
But basically what happened was uh probably a week before it leaked.

704
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:44,959
People were pointing out the these patches that went in

705
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:47,270
the kernel that were about the page table isolation,

706
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:47,819
right?

707
00:30:48,199 --> 00:30:49,880
And they said, what's the deal with this?

708
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,160
And of course, there were a bunch of people that were like, oh, it's no big deal,

709
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:52,510
whatever.

710
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,500
It's just page table

711
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,229
-- isolation.
-- I was like

712
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,550
so sick for seven days over Christmas.

713
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:00,630
So I, I basically have, I literally have like a seven day gap in my memory.

714
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:02,430
That's good. That's good.

715
00:31:02,739 --> 00:31:02,839
But

716
00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:05,729
so, so anyway, right there, there were people were wondering, thinking,

717
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:06,390
what's going on

718
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,579
and then, then the A MD patch landed, people were like, oh yeah, like Intel Chips,

719
00:31:12,589 --> 00:31:13,520
this is a problem.

720
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:16,660
And then in fact, I, I saw someone on Twitter

721
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,989
posted a, a demo exploit essentially

722
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:23,699
because they guessed what the issue was and they figured out how to reproduce it.

723
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:27,890
And at that point and then, and then people started going on and on and on about how,

724
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,650
oh Intel Chips, Intel chips and then Intel

725
00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:35,119
issued their press release and that seems to be when like it was, it was done, right?

726
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:35,439
Like,

727
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:35,930
well,

728
00:31:35,939 --> 00:31:37,390
I remember the press release came out and that

729
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,180
was after like the register article and stuff.

730
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,829
Yes. Right. Right.

731
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,589
Like, so, I mean, there were like long articles talking, it was interesting,

732
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:47,739
you know, they were talking about the performance hit and everything, right.

733
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:50,160
So this, that, that was part of the problem. Right. It was blowing up.

734
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:52,000
A, we have a huge problem.

735
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:55,290
B like the solution sucks and there's a huge performance impact,

736
00:31:55,569 --> 00:31:58,459
you know, everybody's freaking out and, yeah, I do remember that part.

737
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,430
Um Luckily I've been on PTO this week officially, but whatever.

738
00:32:02,689 --> 00:32:03,349
Um

739
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,270
So, yeah, it's, yeah, it,

740
00:32:08,609 --> 00:32:09,040
I,

741
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:13,719
I mean, can you imagine if this had leaked back in August or July, you know, with,

742
00:32:13,979 --> 00:32:17,719
with not having patches and proper engineering effort

743
00:32:17,989 --> 00:32:18,829
to fix it.

744
00:32:19,349 --> 00:32:20,260
Um, or

745
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:20,930
I

746
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,290
can

747
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,040
have a solution,

748
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,920
I can tell you it would have happened

749
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:28,680
is people would have made very poor choices

750
00:32:29,109 --> 00:32:32,719
and then they would, we would have ended up with something terrible.

751
00:32:32,829 --> 00:32:35,040
And in fact, like, like this is something that

752
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,560
when this happened and I was talking to some people

753
00:32:38,569 --> 00:32:39,719
I know who are trying to deal with it.

754
00:32:39,729 --> 00:32:42,479
Like, oh my goodness, we have to hurry up and fix it. I'm like, no,

755
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:46,599
do not hurry because if you rush, you will make poor decisions.

756
00:32:46,609 --> 00:32:48,650
And I said this isn't so bad.

757
00:32:48,939 --> 00:32:54,030
You need to like, go blow up the garage, take your time and do this. Right?

758
00:32:54,449 --> 00:32:56,920
Well, and that's the funny thing, like on the client side,

759
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:03,260
this is so exploitable because javascript, right? Like is there a single client

760
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,579
system now that doesn't do web browsing? Like for a lot of its life?

761
00:33:08,589 --> 00:33:12,579
Like when I look at my phone and I look at my laptop and my tablet, like

762
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:17,989
you know, it's 80% web browsing, 10% fallout shelter, like 10% you know, omni

763
00:33:18,209 --> 00:33:19,060
focus and email.

764
00:33:19,219 --> 00:33:20,599
-- Actually.
-- You want to know what's really cool.

765
00:33:20,609 --> 00:33:23,780
Is I bought a little chromebook for, for my travels

766
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,170
because it, it's way less hackable than, and, and let's face it.

767
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:31,810
I know you love the Mac. But man, the Mac has like no boot up security.

768
00:33:31,949 --> 00:33:32,810
It's really bad.

769
00:33:33,339 --> 00:33:33,410
But

770
00:33:34,339 --> 00:33:35,859
-- with the T two chip,
-- do they

771
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:36,319
just read

772
00:33:36,489 --> 00:33:39,150
about it? I haven't paid attention anyway. I have a chromebook.

773
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,890
Do you know what a chromebook is? It's a freaking web browser.

774
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,979
Like that's, that's all it is. It's amazing. It's, it's awesome though.

775
00:33:45,989 --> 00:33:46,790
I really like it.

776
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,959
I've seriously thought about buying one.

777
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,770
the main thing is just,

778
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:55,750
I haven't gotten around to it because I have an ipad Pro now that basically does that.

779
00:33:56,089 --> 00:33:58,010
-- Yeah.
-- Right. I would assume an ipad

780
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:01,290
Pro is basically a chromebook. Probably just fancier.

781
00:34:02,609 --> 00:34:05,709
It's got a really nice touchscreen, like, oh my God, it's gorgeous.

782
00:34:05,719 --> 00:34:08,360
I have a touchscreen. I don't know if it's good. I've never touched it.

783
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:10,750
I don't like touching the screen because then it gets all smudged up.

784
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:11,350
Like,

785
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,489
I don't know how

786
00:34:12,728 --> 00:34:14,030
figured that one out, but they did.

787
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:17,360
But yeah, going back to this. So it's uh yeah. No,

788
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,149
the whole thing, just

789
00:34:19,629 --> 00:34:21,889
what's fascinating to me is that the flaw

790
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:23,840
itself is definitely real and definitely bad.

791
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:25,489
And like I said, it's, it's

792
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:27,010
very exploitable.

793
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:30,090
On the client side because javascript, but on the server side,

794
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,949
let's be blunt on the server side.

795
00:34:32,188 --> 00:34:34,989
-- OK.
-- No, I, I would argue it's worse.

796
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,168
No, let's be blunt on the server side, especially with Linux,

797
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,250
there's enough Linux kernel flaws that if somebody

798
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,770
gets code execution on a Linux box,

799
00:34:43,178 --> 00:34:46,938
sooner or later, they will get root code execution. I mean, there was just,

800
00:34:47,228 --> 00:34:49,759
uh let's go to OS S security and look at like,

801
00:34:49,768 --> 00:34:52,839
was it today's traffic or late yesterday's traffic

802
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:56,967
where there was yet another Linux kernel flaw where they're like, we don't think,

803
00:34:56,978 --> 00:34:58,638
I mean, it's definitely a denial service

804
00:34:58,908 --> 00:35:01,519
but it may or may not be. Uh Here we go.

805
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:05,669
Uh I use after free vulnerability was found in network games faces code blah, blah,

806
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:06,669
blah, blah blah.

807
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:08,709
This vulnerability could allow an unprivileged

808
00:35:08,909 --> 00:35:12,000
user to induce kernel memory corruption on the system leading to a crash

809
00:35:12,219 --> 00:35:15,360
due to the nature of the flaw privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out,

810
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:16,790
although we believe it is unlikely.

811
00:35:16,929 --> 00:35:18,820
All right. And it probably is unlikely. But

812
00:35:19,649 --> 00:35:22,919
literally this email with this Linux kernel flaw is like

813
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,199
-- we get several of these a week.
-- Yeah, but OK, but here's the thing is

814
00:35:27,699 --> 00:35:29,479
on, on a server,

815
00:35:29,709 --> 00:35:35,520
you are probably correct. But on something like an Amazon host,

816
00:35:36,219 --> 00:35:39,780
it's a huge deal man where you've got that shared resources.

817
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,399
This is the magic breakout of the VM thing.

818
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:45,879
And, but if you remember, like if you look back 10 years ago

819
00:35:46,209 --> 00:35:46,770
VM.

820
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:49,040
Escapes were all the rage because we had just

821
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,919
built this VM technology and let's be blunt,

822
00:35:50,929 --> 00:35:52,280
security wise, it stunk

823
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:55,679
and we're going through the same thing with containers, right? Containers

824
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,929
are,

825
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:59,270
you know, they're good from an operational point of view.

826
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,000
They're amazing, but from a security point of view. Oh, good Lord.

827
00:36:02,399 --> 00:36:04,280
They're, they're not secure yet.

828
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:08,040
Like we're, you know, now that we have the name spacing stuff going that,

829
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:10,070
that will add heavily to the security.

830
00:36:10,429 --> 00:36:13,030
Um But I mean, a, a great example of the,

831
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,939
the container issue is like you're still talking to the host colonel

832
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,580
and like I said, you know, the Linux kernel has no end of flaws.

833
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:24,179
I mean, it's what, 65 million lines of code or something, goofy

834
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,419
give or take,

835
00:36:26,649 --> 00:36:27,129
you know.

836
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:29,250
So the reality is,

837
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,580
I mean, yeah, VM escapes are really,

838
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,679
really bad because we've come to rely on

839
00:36:33,689 --> 00:36:36,780
V MS for that security barrier like firewalls,

840
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:38,030
you know?

841
00:36:38,379 --> 00:36:39,310
Right. Right.

842
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:42,100
Um Like, remember back when firewalls,

843
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:44,189
you could bypass them with source based routing,

844
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:44,860
you know,

845
00:36:45,399 --> 00:36:48,310
and like every single firewall currently available at that time,

846
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,729
you could literally just bypass by turning on source routing

847
00:36:50,899 --> 00:36:52,229
and literally putting in the packet,

848
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:54,679
like go from here to here to here and the firewall is like her, the

849
00:36:54,949 --> 00:36:56,209
ok, doke, you know,

850
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,149
and then firewalls got less stupid.

851
00:36:59,600 --> 00:36:59,709
Yeah.

852
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:04,139
Well, it's like any technology and this is something that I love to harp about is

853
00:37:04,379 --> 00:37:05,709
nothing starts perfect.

854
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:06,790
You know, you, you,

855
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,209
you've got to make it better over time and problems

856
00:37:09,219 --> 00:37:10,790
will be found and they will be dealt with.

857
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,429
And I mean,

858
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,629
this issue is part of

859
00:37:13,919 --> 00:37:18,169
what are going to be many similar issues on what will be a very long journey

860
00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:22,219
for Intel because they haven't really had to deal with this kind of problem before.

861
00:37:22,659 --> 00:37:24,709
Well, but I mean, in the last few, well,

862
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,110
in the last week we've had this,

863
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,439
the certificate flaw,

864
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:30,479
we've had the Intel management engine flaws and the

865
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:33,620
Intel management engine flaws are arguably much worse because

866
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:34,879
not only are they like,

867
00:37:34,889 --> 00:37:39,419
exploitable over the network but exploitable over the network when the machine is,

868
00:37:39,429 --> 00:37:42,169
I want to say off right in the sense of you.

869
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:46,429
And I think like, hey, there's no lights on so it's off, but apparently

870
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:52,330
it's on because of magic, lights out management slash network, wake up stuff.

871
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:52,800
You know,

872
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:53,330
the

873
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,060
magic,

874
00:37:54,929 --> 00:37:57,179
everything is magic. That's the lesson.

875
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,229
Yeah. Well, bad magic or good magic. I don't know.

876
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:00,979
Yeah.

877
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:04,189
And I mean, I guess also good news is too, we're also getting layered defenses,

878
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:04,379
right?

879
00:38:04,389 --> 00:38:05,469
Like, uh Firefox

880
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:09,379
solution released an update. Chrome is releasing an update that is making

881
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,000
this flaw harder to exploit even if you don't patch the underlying system.

882
00:38:13,139 --> 00:38:16,070
That's really funny. Do you know how the Firefox patch works?

883
00:38:16,889 --> 00:38:20,070
No, they, they made their, their timers suck more.

884
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,360
So you basically.

885
00:38:21,629 --> 00:38:21,780
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah,

886
00:38:22,669 --> 00:38:23,560
they,

887
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:25,879
they reduce the uh the accuracy of the

888
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:29,469
-- timers
-- because you need a very high precision timer

889
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:30,389
to, to,

890
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,669
to exploit this.

891
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:35,760
And so Firefox no longer has a very high precision timer in javascript,

892
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:40,070
which means you can still exploit it. Technically, you just can't measure it.

893
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:40,840
So it's like schrodinger

894
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,739
-- flaw now or something exploit
-- well,

895
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:48,580
and for an information leak or uh an information disclosure flaw,

896
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,699
that that's good enough.

897
00:38:49,709 --> 00:38:52,399
Well, not only that, actually, I think Firefox doing

898
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,620
is wise because like you said,

899
00:38:54,629 --> 00:38:57,340
everyone's using web browsers for like everything my guess is

900
00:38:57,350 --> 00:39:00,860
most web browsers don't need high precision timing like this.

901
00:39:01,229 --> 00:39:01,899
And

902
00:39:02,129 --> 00:39:07,389
there are going to be more problems similar to this, I think, found in the next six

903
00:39:07,629 --> 00:39:08,699
months to a year.

904
00:39:08,969 --> 00:39:11,110
So Firefox is going to be ok.

905
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:11,510
Yeah,

906
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,379
almost every single situation I've seen where the server or

907
00:39:14,389 --> 00:39:18,439
whatever client component will report back exactly how long stuff took

908
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:22,510
ends up being a problem, right? Because it allows an attacker to very

909
00:39:23,179 --> 00:39:23,719
uh

910
00:39:23,959 --> 00:39:27,750
discreetly and, you know, with a high degree of confidence,

911
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,969
figure out what's going on internally to some degree.

912
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:33,870
-- Actually,
-- you know, it's interesting you bring this up that this has me thinking now

913
00:39:34,189 --> 00:39:38,040
how many applications really need a high precision timer?

914
00:39:38,229 --> 00:39:39,570
My guess is not many.

915
00:39:40,149 --> 00:39:43,760
No, the trick is most of them need a high performance timer

916
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,500
but

917
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,409
-- internally or for logging not to explode.
-- Not

918
00:39:50,459 --> 00:39:51,169
exactly like

919
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:55,149
my guess is there are very few applications in

920
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:58,699
user space that actually need high precision timers.

921
00:39:58,909 --> 00:40:01,209
And I wonder if you had like ac group or something

922
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:02,610
to control

923
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:06,169
how much I, I guess how, how precise your timing can be

924
00:40:06,699 --> 00:40:07,500
in user space.

925
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:10,570
You could probably neuter most side channel attacks because let's face it,

926
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,709
side channel attacks

927
00:40:12,219 --> 00:40:16,510
-- almost always rely on timing. I
-- wonder if you can monkey with the system clock.

928
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,229
What do you mean monkey with the system clock

929
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:21,820
uh reduce the accuracy.

930
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:25,239
Uh For example, do 10 millisecond chunks or 100 millisecond chunks?

931
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,100
Oh, I see what you're saying.

932
00:40:27,399 --> 00:40:30,820
-- Yeah, that could be
-- like literally the system clocks like it's now

933
00:40:30,949 --> 00:40:32,520
0.1 of a second later.

934
00:40:32,949 --> 00:40:34,770
You want better than that. Too bad. Go away.

935
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,580
Yeah. Well, no, you can re enable it or something, right? I mean,

936
00:40:38,989 --> 00:40:42,290
because there are applications that need it, but most don't funnily.

937
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,449
Yeah, like QT pass, for example,

938
00:40:44,669 --> 00:40:46,219
QT pass, this is great.

939
00:40:46,419 --> 00:40:48,610
QT pass uses lipsy random

940
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:53,090
which is based on milliseconds or something. But here's the best part is it

941
00:40:53,449 --> 00:40:56,080
instead of using the number of milliseconds since epoch,

942
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:58,500
which would not have been good, but it would have been

943
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:00,090
somewhat better than what they did.

944
00:41:00,489 --> 00:41:03,419
They did the number of seconds since or sorry,

945
00:41:03,429 --> 00:41:06,689
they did the number of milliseconds since the last second,

946
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:09,350
which meant there were 1000 random possibilities.

947
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:13,330
So QT pass when it was securely generating you a

948
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:18,229
password would have securely generated you one of 1000 passwords.

949
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:20,639
Yeah,

950
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:22,570
that's great.

951
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:23,770
Yeah,

952
00:41:23,979 --> 00:41:26,959
the uh the original author of the pass code that he was like,

953
00:41:26,969 --> 00:41:28,250
you probably shouldn't use these other

954
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,629
applications to generate passwords because they're,

955
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:34,850
uh, and in fairness like this reminds me of,

956
00:41:35,139 --> 00:41:37,330
I remember I was reading some C code

957
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:39,610
and rather than use, make

958
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,830
temp to make a temporary file securely,

959
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:49,050
they shelled out to bash with a set of six commands trying to make a secure directory.

960
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:51,939
And the funny thing is if they just shelled out to bash and called

961
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,379
Make a stamp in bash, it would have been fine.

962
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:59,300
But they actually, like, tried to manually make a directory using shell commands

963
00:41:59,689 --> 00:42:02,219
securely and of course, they failed miserably.

964
00:42:02,449 --> 00:42:04,949
And it was this horrendously complex thing with like

965
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:08,419
probably 100 times the overhead of just using Make us

966
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:09,040
T

967
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:09,830
right.

968
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:14,030
I see problems like this on a regular basis and I have a suspicion the,

969
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,429
the author didn't know what make it t

970
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,169
is.

971
00:42:17,399 --> 00:42:20,110
I mean, that's what it really comes down to. And so they did what they knew

972
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:23,610
and it was, it was wrong and it was bad, but it's all they knew.

973
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:24,770
So,

974
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:25,830
you know.

975
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,719
But I mean, well, I feel like especially in today's world when you Google,

976
00:42:28,729 --> 00:42:30,739
like make directory securely or something,

977
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,929
you're going to get a good stack overflow answer

978
00:42:34,899 --> 00:42:35,929
you will now.

979
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:36,810
Yes.

980
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:37,330
And I guess,

981
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,129
and I guess in fairness the intel guys don't

982
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:41,870
have that luxury of like how to securely make,

983
00:42:41,879 --> 00:42:43,729
you know, speculative branch predictor.

984
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,610
Oh, hey, look at that answer.

985
00:42:45,899 --> 00:42:46,449
You know.

986
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:53,550
So I, what I'm curious though is there's got to be more of this.

987
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:54,719
Oh, you know, there is,

988
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:56,899
there's tons of it, man.

989
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:00,610
Well, not only that, I mean, that's something to think about is the fact that the,

990
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,010
there, there's really, there were two flaws,

991
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,669
there's meltdown and specter and meltdown is

992
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:07,699
what's fixed with the page table isolation

993
00:43:07,989 --> 00:43:10,580
specter is basically unfixable today

994
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:14,199
and it affects basically every CPU on the planet.

995
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,310
So

996
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:19,540
that one is where I suspect there's going to be tons of

997
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:23,379
new and interesting research happening because it's ripe for the picking.

998
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,199
Well, and the beauty is

999
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,689
hardware, it

1000
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:30,320
just can't get updated like software can

1001
00:43:30,709 --> 00:43:33,199
I mean, software is bad enough but hardware like,

1002
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:34,679
you know.

1003
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:38,810
Yeah, I, I can't throw it on my laptops, let alone my data center.

1004
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:43,149
Yes, that's micro code man. Right. That's the answer.

1005
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:45,870
-- Except not in this case,
-- right? Minor details.

1006
00:43:46,879 --> 00:43:47,270
And

1007
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:51,790
so, but the good news is raspberry pies are immune. So just buy like several

1008
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:56,300
billion trillion. I don't know. Lots, rack them up, you'll be fine.

1009
00:43:56,679 --> 00:43:56,929
You know,

1010
00:43:56,939 --> 00:44:00,649
that's something I think about a lot is I I've done some investigation into

1011
00:44:00,659 --> 00:44:02,260
seeing like how could you build like

1012
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:05,350
a nice Raspberry Pi racked infrastructure thing?

1013
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:05,989
And

1014
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,270
it's, it's painful, man. There isn't a good way to power them.

1015
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,790
That's really the trick because you need all those stupid micro USB cables.

1016
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:14,389
Uh,

1017
00:44:14,629 --> 00:44:17,770
yeah, I guess you could just build an adapter that clicks on to a five volt.

1018
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,110
I don't want to do that. I'm so lazy.

1019
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,379
They actually for,

1020
00:44:22,389 --> 00:44:24,699
for the Raspberry Pi Zeros you can get like this big

1021
00:44:24,709 --> 00:44:26,879
board and plug in like 20 of them or something.

1022
00:44:26,889 --> 00:44:28,139
And that's really neat and all.

1023
00:44:28,149 --> 00:44:31,739
But I'm, yeah, it's, it's more expensive than I'm willing to pay.

1024
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:33,689
I want like four raspberry pies

1025
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:37,899
with a nice rack and like 11 power outlet thing just.

1026
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:38,899
But anyway,

1027
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:41,010
anyway,

1028
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:42,280
right,

1029
00:44:42,489 --> 00:44:46,050
I guess the moral of the story is

1030
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:48,270
expect the unexpected

1031
00:44:48,659 --> 00:44:50,600
because it's probably gonna happen anyways.

1032
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,229
No, that's not the moral moral of this at all.

1033
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:56,750
I think what this is, this issue has been a monkey show, man. I mean,

1034
00:44:56,969 --> 00:44:57,919
you look at

1035
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,540
it, it, first of all, it got discovered early

1036
00:45:00,659 --> 00:45:04,149
and now I'm going to give all the people involved a ton of credit because I

1037
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:09,070
think the Intel and the developers who worked on the patches did a very nice job,

1038
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:09,350
right.

1039
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,590
At least a little early, big deal, whatever it happens.

1040
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:16,129
But then everybody jumps in with their own little commentary and everyone's, I,

1041
00:45:16,139 --> 00:45:20,699
I've read like 40 blogs describing the issue and some of them got it right.

1042
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:22,659
And like, it's just been

1043
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,419
a total circus and I mean,

1044
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,139
we're doing a podcast about it obviously, but our focus is on the, the,

1045
00:45:28,149 --> 00:45:30,699
I guess fringe things, we'll say maybe the meta

1046
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:32,709
around it. But like,

1047
00:45:33,169 --> 00:45:34,870
you know what this feels like to me kind of

1048
00:45:34,879 --> 00:45:39,790
the way Intel has done some of their marketing driven announcements

1049
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,550
about this and stuff. This feels like security flaws in 2002

1050
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:50,050
when it was very much a marketing problem and not a, a security problem.

1051
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:51,840
Like that's what this feels like.

1052
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:53,649
I think part of it is

1053
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,510
the security marketing side of software has become a solved problem.

1054
00:45:57,810 --> 00:45:58,669
The security,

1055
00:45:59,149 --> 00:46:02,979
the security marketing side of hardware flaws is like something that's sort of

1056
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:07,139
-- new again. It is
-- just beginning is what it is.

1057
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:08,189
Yeah.

1058
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,350
Um because there's definitely gonna be more of this.

1059
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,939
I mean, people, you know, there's golden in our hills,

1060
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,540
you know, why do you rob banks? That's where the money is

1061
00:46:17,889 --> 00:46:21,350
now on that note though, exploiting these kind of flaws like

1062
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:26,669
-- this is tough stuff, man. This is like voodoo magic.
-- I mean, until somebody makes a

1063
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:26,929
metis

1064
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:28,399
-- even
-- with a metas

1065
00:46:28,679 --> 00:46:29,469
module, man,

1066
00:46:29,479 --> 00:46:31,360
this isn't one of those things that you're going

1067
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:33,489
to see people like fuzzing their way into.

1068
00:46:33,629 --> 00:46:34,439
I wonder if you could

1069
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:35,810
probably not

1070
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:36,639
anyway,

1071
00:46:37,429 --> 00:46:37,449
you

1072
00:46:38,409 --> 00:46:39,209
crashes,

1073
00:46:39,439 --> 00:46:42,020
whether or not they're exploitable is another matter.

1074
00:46:42,439 --> 00:46:44,540
That's what I see with fuzzing mostly is they're like,

1075
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:48,810
here's 200 things that crash law and I'm like, super good for you.

1076
00:46:49,429 --> 00:46:52,229
Are they exploitable? And they're like, oh, I don't know. I want you to look at them.

1077
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:52,669
I'm like,

1078
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:53,989
-- don't,
-- I

1079
00:46:54,459 --> 00:46:57,229
know, I know. And it ends up being like one patch,

1080
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,219
right? Like one little line,

1081
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,679
one just check.

1082
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:01,629
That's all it was.

1083
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,729
Yeah. So,

1084
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:08,360
um, yeah, this stuff is a lot. Information disclosures are especially

1085
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,550
generally more tricky. I mean, funnily enough.

1086
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:14,840
I did find information disclosures back in the day in file wiping programs.

1087
00:47:14,949 --> 00:47:18,179
But that was pretty simple because I basically would like, write the hard drive,

1088
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,500
uh, you know,

1089
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:23,360
wipe it and then write files to it and then supposedly wipe

1090
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:25,780
it and then try to find any trace of those files,

1091
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:27,320
you know, and

1092
00:47:27,439 --> 00:47:28,580
I found traces of them.

1093
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:30,739
Uh, but that, you know, that was easy in the sense of,

1094
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:34,280
I had a lot of control over what was being written and read and all that,

1095
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:36,750
you know, with stuff in the CPU, for example, like

1096
00:47:37,669 --> 00:47:40,489
it's, yeah, it's, uh, it's a little more tricky.

1097
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:47,070
Yeah. No, I, I agree completely. I think this one is special. Well, it's special now.

1098
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:47,280
It,

1099
00:47:47,669 --> 00:47:47,879
except

1100
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:48,290
it was

1101
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,469
one of the three sets of people found it.

1102
00:47:51,629 --> 00:47:52,300
So,

1103
00:47:52,419 --> 00:47:53,060
you know.

1104
00:47:53,479 --> 00:47:54,199
Yeah,

1105
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:57,439
-- special.
-- Like your momma used to say you were special. I am

1106
00:47:57,449 --> 00:47:58,169
special. K

1107
00:47:58,389 --> 00:47:59,469
we all know that

1108
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:02,580
just not for the reasons I think I am.

1109
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:03,010
But no,

1110
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:06,719
I agree about the monkey circus of like everybody trying to chime in and get their,

1111
00:48:07,209 --> 00:48:08,800
they're saying and well,

1112
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:12,159
even a MD is kind of like we're not vulnerable and Intel is like, yes you are.

1113
00:48:12,169 --> 00:48:12,469
And

1114
00:48:12,679 --> 00:48:16,889
I mean, I love Linus's response of, well, a MD seems confident so, like, cool,

1115
00:48:16,899 --> 00:48:20,070
we'll accept this patch and if it bites them, well, too bad for them

1116
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:20,989
and you know what?

1117
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:24,199
-- I think that's totally fair.
-- That's exactly the right way to handle it.

1118
00:48:24,209 --> 00:48:26,909
If A MD says we're fine, believe them

1119
00:48:27,149 --> 00:48:31,469
and if someone proves them wrong we will make fun of them for a very long time.

1120
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:32,699
Yeah,

1121
00:48:33,709 --> 00:48:35,379
I do hope they're right.

1122
00:48:37,159 --> 00:48:39,520
Well, just for the sake of it's going to be stressful for a lot of people.

1123
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:40,699
-- If they're not,
-- I,

1124
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:45,010
I'm confident there will be a similar problem found

1125
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:47,270
in a MD chips in the very near future.

1126
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:50,679
Hopefully though A MD has the ability to update the micro code

1127
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:52,179
-- and
-- fix
-- it. Right. Right.

1128
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,459
That would be ideal.

1129
00:48:53,929 --> 00:48:58,290
-- But we'll see,
-- I also wonder if there's not other defenses people will be looking at,

1130
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:01,739
you know, when they build CP us now to not just have micro code updates,

1131
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:03,209
but what else they can do?

1132
00:49:03,219 --> 00:49:03,530
You know?

1133
00:49:03,929 --> 00:49:06,669
Uh, probably I'm sure there will be work done

1134
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:10,080
to make sure this kind of stuff isn't a problem in the future.

1135
00:49:10,389 --> 00:49:11,139
I guarantee it

1136
00:49:11,379 --> 00:49:12,209
-- so.
-- Well,

1137
00:49:13,239 --> 00:49:14,139
I guess that's it.

1138
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:14,419
I

1139
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:15,840
guess that's it.

1140
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:19,550
Oh, man, it's been, it's been a week.

1141
00:49:19,669 --> 00:49:19,969
Well,

1142
00:49:19,979 --> 00:49:22,020
and timing wise that was part of the benefit is

1143
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:24,760
because everybody wanted to get everything ready before Christmas.

1144
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:25,379
And good to go.

1145
00:49:25,389 --> 00:49:28,179
-- So it largely was,
-- you know, and honestly,

1146
00:49:28,189 --> 00:49:32,379
we are very lucky this didn't leak before Christmas because man,

1147
00:49:32,389 --> 00:49:35,300
there would have been some seriously ruined Christmases.

1148
00:49:35,969 --> 00:49:37,229
Yep. Oh, yeah.

1149
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:39,370
Yeah.

1150
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,800
You figure we took what, two weeks off from podcasting. I'm not gonna lie.

1151
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:43,669
It was kind of nice,

1152
00:49:43,959 --> 00:49:48,830
but we're back, we're back. People have to put up with us again. So.

1153
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:49,709
All right, cool, man.

1154
00:49:49,959 --> 00:49:53,399
I'm, I'm calling it, I'm calling it. I don't think we can add much more to this one.

1155
00:49:53,409 --> 00:49:55,739
So, thank you everyone for listening. Thank you, Kurt.
