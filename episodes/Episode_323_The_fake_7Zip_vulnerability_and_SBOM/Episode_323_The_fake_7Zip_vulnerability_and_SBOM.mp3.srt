Hello and welcome to the open

1
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,689
source security podcast with myself,

2
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:11,500
Kurt Siefried and my partner in reading security advisories

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,079
that are May or may not be true.

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:13,810
Josh Presser.

5
00:00:14,079 --> 00:00:16,079
That is the dumbest intro

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:17,360
you have ever done.

7
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:18,600
I'm ok with it.

8
00:00:18,729 --> 00:00:21,909
That's fine. I mean, yeah, the bar is pretty low here, so it's fine.

9
00:00:22,569 --> 00:00:22,579
Uh

10
00:00:23,069 --> 00:00:26,760
-- So I've
-- got, I'm actually more shocked that seven zip still exists.

11
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,000
We'll get to that. We'll get, I'll tell you my story first that that's how we do this.

12
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,280
You see you do the intro.

13
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:32,450
I have some

14
00:00:32,639 --> 00:00:34,099
enlightening insight

15
00:00:34,599 --> 00:00:36,419
and then we talk about our topic.

16
00:00:36,529 --> 00:00:38,459
So I, I've got a laptop that runs Linux.

17
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,810
It's where I do all of the like podcast recording the show editing.

18
00:00:41,819 --> 00:00:44,849
I do all the podcast stuff on. It's like my personal laptop, right? Dual

19
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,400
boots Windows, by the way, which I basically boot windows,

20
00:00:47,409 --> 00:00:48,540
like once every couple of months,

21
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,040
let it run for like six days to install all the updates.

22
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:51,549
But,

23
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,430
and sometimes I play games on it occasionally.

24
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,279
However, now, now Steam support because of the Steam deck and it runs Linux.

25
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:03,159
Actually, Steam has surprisingly good support to run all the games on Linux now.

26
00:01:03,169 --> 00:01:04,050
So, so anyway,

27
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,949
that's not the reason I'm bringing this up.

28
00:01:06,169 --> 00:01:11,040
So it amuses me that this laptop it's a, a Lenovo, uh,

29
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:15,040
idea pad is the brand and things always go wrong.

30
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:19,080
We like sometimes the sound quits working with the new kernel update. Sometimes

31
00:01:19,419 --> 00:01:21,620
the, the brightness on the screen doesn't work, whatever,

32
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:23,970
pick a thing and this time the, it,

33
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,800
it wouldn't go to sleep or rather it would go to sleep but would never wake up.

34
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,279
Right. Which is obviously the most amusing way.

35
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,059
It's,

36
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:31,330
it's

37
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:33,620
so,

38
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:34,029
here's,

39
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,739
well, it went to sleep.

40
00:01:36,059 --> 00:01:40,800
I actually found out I could wake it up if I would plug in an external

41
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:44,120
keyboard and push buttons on the keyboard that would wake it up for some reason.

42
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:47,680
But the, like nothing else on the laptop would work when you run Linux.

43
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,760
This is, this is normal.

44
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,349
Yeah. As a Linux user, this is perfectly fine

45
00:01:52,669 --> 00:01:53,089
and

46
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:53,360
I

47
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:54,750
gave up on Linux,

48
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:55,949
whatever.

49
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,589
I want to close my laptop lid and then open my laptop lid and

50
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:04,209
-- have my computer work in a quick amount of time. Not,
-- it works again.

51
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:08,419
The newest kernel 5.17 dot uh, let me look, uh,

52
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:09,220
uh,

53
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,779
5.17 0.5 fixed it. So,

54
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,490
but it's funny because my, my, my kids

55
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,639
are old enough now that they like play games and

56
00:02:18,649 --> 00:02:20,809
they care about computers and they know enough about them

57
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:21,850
and

58
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,289
they'll ask me questions like, why, why does your computer always break?

59
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,850
And it's like, because I run Linux, like,

60
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,330
this is just clearly punishment for some sins from the past or something.

61
00:02:30,339 --> 00:02:31,309
And I just,

62
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,720
I absolutely love the fact that you never know what

63
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:37,009
is going to happen every time you update your kernel.

64
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,990
And it amused because this morning I update the computer.

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,050
I was booting an older kernel that sleep worked on

66
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:43,149
and then

67
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:44,970
I update my kernel. I get a new one.

68
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:48,589
I'm like, oh, I should see if they fixed the bug and they did. So now I'm happy today.

69
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,229
So there's that,

70
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:50,669
-- that's all, that's my
-- story.

71
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,039
That is, I have to say Linux has gotten to be less of an adventure and more of a,

72
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:55,850
it works.

73
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,949
But, yeah, it's still,

74
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:59,179
-- yeah,
-- it's pretty boring. Now. I mean,

75
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:03,830
I remember back in the day I would usually dedicate about a week to get

76
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:08,130
my computer working correctly when I installed a new version of whatever on it.

77
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:09,089
Sounds about right.

78
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,789
And now like, yeah, it, it basically just works. It's,

79
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:13,990
it's boring.

80
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,699
Part of me is glad it's boring. And part of me is like, man, those were fun days.

81
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,350
And my guess is they weren't, it's just,

82
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,990
I remember as a youth when I had a lot of free time and I thought it was fun.

83
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:27,550
Well, this came up actually, I was talking with somebody yesterday about

84
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,889
having, like, I don't basically I pointed out,

85
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:34,770
I am paying this person at a professional rate to teach me something because

86
00:03:34,899 --> 00:03:36,419
I could learn it on my own.

87
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,179
Or I could spend some money. That's not even my money

88
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:43,990
for this person to help teach me and get it done faster and get his expertise

89
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:45,630
because I just don't have that spare time.

90
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:47,929
He's like, yeah, you know, like back in the, I'm like, yeah, when I was like,

91
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,960
when I was a teenager I wrote a 50,000 word document for fun

92
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,639
because I had spare time to do that. Like nowadays.

93
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,259
-- No,
-- I, I hear you. I hear you completely. It's,

94
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,619
yeah. Yeah,

95
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:00,679
I, I, as I age

96
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:05,949
it has become more and more obvious that time and money are

97
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:10,750
two parts of the same equation and when you're young you don't have any money.

98
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:13,779
But now that I'm older and I have a little bit of money, it's like

99
00:04:14,029 --> 00:04:17,980
that time is looking pretty good these days. You know,

100
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:21,019
I think there's a third thing too is that you, you,

101
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:24,859
you can actually assign a value to time more than when you're younger. Like there.

102
00:04:24,869 --> 00:04:27,179
I now know what is and is not important to me.

103
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,220
Yeah.

104
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:29,179
Yeah, I agree. Right.

105
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,000
There are activities I will not do, like,

106
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,399
I will not spend a lot of time playing video

107
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,959
games anymore because to me that's a waste of time.

108
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,299
Whereas when I was a kid that was fun and now there's things I would much rather do.

109
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:39,230
Right. It's not to say that video games are bad.

110
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:41,190
I think video games are actually pretty damn awesome.

111
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:43,739
But there are even more awesome things for me to do now.

112
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,850
I mean, sometimes I still, there's a handful of games.

113
00:04:46,859 --> 00:04:49,429
I'm happy to sit down and play every now and then.

114
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,579
-- Oh,
-- I still crank out some time on Factorio.

115
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,329
Uh,

116
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,119
that one and

117
00:04:54,369 --> 00:04:55,089
Peoria scares me.

118
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,290
I started playing it for a little bit and I'm like, I can see,

119
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:01,720
I can see the hole I am digging for myself with this game.

120
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:02,890
I need to, I need to stop.

121
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,359
No, the ones I like,

122
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:07,540
I love like Super Mario games because I can play them for

123
00:05:07,549 --> 00:05:11,369
like 20 minutes and then not play them again for a year.

124
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,209
And it doesn't matter.

125
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,630
That's definitely something I want is casual.

126
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:16,179
I'm a filthy cash.

127
00:05:18,299 --> 00:05:18,820
I

128
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,720
anyway, anyway,

129
00:05:21,369 --> 00:05:25,700
-- we have a lovely topic today. Speaking
-- of casuals, this weird seven zip.

130
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:29,429
-- It,
-- you can't just say casuals, you have to say filthy casuals.

131
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,649
-- I did say filthy casuals, didn't
-- I I only hear casuals.

132
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,170
I meant well, when I say casuals, it's implied that it's a filthy casual. You have

133
00:05:36,329 --> 00:05:36,410
to do

134
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,190
any other kind.

135
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:39,890
Ok. So this filthy casual.

136
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,940
So apparently there is

137
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,980
possibly a vulnerability in seven zip,

138
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:49,329
but there was a fake exploit code for it published that is not real.

139
00:05:49,609 --> 00:05:53,600
So there is a CV E for this vulnerability that isn't a vulnerability,

140
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:57,070
but there is actually a vulnerability in seven zip

141
00:05:57,589 --> 00:05:59,329
that doesn't have a CV E.

142
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:02,140
That's how I'm reading this after looking through all this source material.

143
00:06:02,299 --> 00:06:04,950
Ok. I want to back up because you just confused me.

144
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,570
I didnt, I didn't think there was a vulnerable

145
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:07,239
there

146
00:06:07,859 --> 00:06:10,109
anyway. Ok. I want to back this all the way up.

147
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:14,070
So there's a gentleman on Twitter Kurt and I both know a name Will Dorman

148
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:19,760
and Will is on my list of people. If Will says something is true, I will believe will.

149
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:24,230
And there's not a lot of people on that list. He is like, Tavis is one of them.

150
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:25,809
-- I
-- don't think I'm on that list.

151
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,869
No, I'm not on this list.

152
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,760
I won't lie to you. You're not on it,

153
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:33,390
but I, I'm not on it either and it's my list.

154
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,029
But

155
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:35,109
so

156
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,149
will Dorman put a thing on Twitter about this fake seven zip

157
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:44,260
advisory that was assigned to CV E

158
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,269
and you actually mentioned it to me like, oh, look at,

159
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,350
look at this from Will because II I missed it.

160
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:53,470
I have like, I have too much crap on Twitter. So I miss lots of stuff and that's ok.

161
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,130
I don't mind missing things but

162
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,309
you tell me about it, I go read it

163
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,329
and the more I read the weirder it keeps getting

164
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,290
and

165
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:06,179
from what I gather at this point, I haven't hit the point of a second issue.

166
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,329
Yet, but whatever it could be in there and I misread,

167
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:09,010
but

168
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,649
basically this person puts

169
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:16,000
a bunch of stuff on Twitter, they publish a bunch of information in a github

170
00:07:16,109 --> 00:07:17,130
repository.

171
00:07:17,299 --> 00:07:18,799
They put a video on youtube

172
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:24,339
that shows a privilege escalation vulnerability on windows with seven zip.

173
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,380
And it's one of those things like a human has to interact with a computer.

174
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:31,140
So it's where a normal person sitting at the computer becomes an admin

175
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,549
by dragging a certain

176
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,739
what seven zip file into the help window or something. I forget exactly what it was.

177
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:39,940
Yeah.

178
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,989
But anyway, get to CV E all the usual stuff.

179
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,850
A bunch of articles get written about it because that's what the press does

180
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,339
and then

181
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,420
-- it looks like it's fake.
-- Well, and here's something that I like.

182
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:53,230
I, I hate it when people try to throw the press under the bus because

183
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,299
normally the press can go to sources and confirm things and that

184
00:07:57,429 --> 00:08:00,000
is really difficult to do here because there's like only one person

185
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,359
that can confirm it and they can easily lie to you.

186
00:08:02,489 --> 00:08:03,799
Well, but also secondly,

187
00:08:04,049 --> 00:08:04,720
the press,

188
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,720
especially the tech press is on horrifically short

189
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,809
deadlines like we're talking 15 minutes max.

190
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,200
-- No,
-- II, I agree. I don't wanna in, in no way.

191
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:18,630
Should anyone construe my statement as bashing the press?

192
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,799
I have a ton of respect for them. I know they're under intense pressure

193
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:24,920
and fundamentally, if the security researcher comes to you and says,

194
00:08:24,929 --> 00:08:25,920
look at this thing I've done.

195
00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:27,470
Here's a video, here's a github

196
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:28,559
repository

197
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:32,880
and they don't mention there's no proof of concept code. But I don't think most,

198
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:36,159
most people wouldn't recognize that as a red flag.

199
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:39,688
You have to be in a very weird group of security researchers, I think to say,

200
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:42,967
-- where's the proof of concept
-- to know what signals to look for?

201
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:45,578
Right? Like you and I have done this for 20 years

202
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,249
and, and this looks plausible.

203
00:08:48,258 --> 00:08:48,479
Well,

204
00:08:48,489 --> 00:08:50,939
and I have a list of like public signals to look

205
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:52,838
at a company to see how their security posture is.

206
00:08:52,848 --> 00:08:54,088
And when I show it to people, they're like,

207
00:08:54,658 --> 00:08:57,129
they'd never thought of like, it's about 20 or 30 things.

208
00:08:57,138 --> 00:08:58,369
And they're like, oh, I never thought of that,

209
00:08:58,859 --> 00:08:59,119
you know,

210
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,739
like that story of this major vendor who doesn't have any way to contact

211
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,400
them about a security vulnerability and there's

212
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:06,500
other major financial institutions like what?

213
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,929
And I'm like, yeah, there, this vendor that you're planning to use has

214
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,809
no public way to tell them about a security vulnerability.

215
00:09:12,849 --> 00:09:14,989
I don't know if they even have a security program.

216
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,859
Like, they don't mention it anywhere. And she's like,

217
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,039
yeah, that's really interesting.

218
00:09:18,049 --> 00:09:19,719
And then I could hear her scribbling notes and I'm like,

219
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:20,789
you know,

220
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,150
I gave her something helpful, but

221
00:09:23,289 --> 00:09:24,030
literally

222
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,500
this,

223
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,119
they never thought to look for that.

224
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,080
Right. And why would they? Right.

225
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,520
It's just because they just, I guess they just assumed it well,

226
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,099
because everybody that size should have a security program.

227
00:09:33,109 --> 00:09:33,520
Right. Like

228
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:35,270
we know that.

229
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,950
Well, no, but we know that these companies quite often don't,

230
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,179
it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter.

231
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,590
So, the point of it all though, right is,

232
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,429
it appears it's not real.

233
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:47,539
And

234
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,539
this is something that

235
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,559
I, I don't know what to think of this even because the researcher

236
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,580
made a lot of, to do about it.

237
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,830
Mhm And then

238
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:02,179
there hasn't really been anything since it's basically been outed as fake.

239
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:03,150
There's

240
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,559
what are we gonna do?

241
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,349
-- II I don't know,
-- like, see what, what annoys me very much is

242
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,479
the lack of feedback loops in the CV process, right?

243
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:17,059
They put Star, star, space disputed space, star

244
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,570
star

245
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,909
-- and, and it should be noted. It got a CV
-- E. No, it's more than disputed. It,

246
00:10:23,619 --> 00:10:26,150
-- yeah, it's
-- disputed and I'm fine with it getting a CV.

247
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,849
Like because let's be clear, like, remember a red hat, like I,

248
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,510
I assigned CV S so

249
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,909
quickly at Red hat basically that like, I remember

250
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,039
we had one in openshift where it was like,

251
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:38,549
that's not a vulnerability, that's just how this product works.

252
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,270
And that is a,

253
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,659
there's like a privilege issue but it has to

254
00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:43,510
be there for like the container builds to work.

255
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,450
And I'm like, oh OK. And so we retracted the CV and you know, got rid of it.

256
00:10:47,739 --> 00:10:51,789
That, that, that's the thing is I would much rather have somebody say, oh, holy.

257
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:54,940
You know, I think there's a really bad problem here and let people know about it

258
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:56,789
and then retract it versus

259
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,429
the, you know, no,

260
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,250
you have to prove it's completely legitimately correct

261
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,479
before we'll even consider talking to you.

262
00:11:03,859 --> 00:11:04,799
And, and that's

263
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,789
-- what CV E does now. And that's wrong. I think.
-- I agree.

264
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:12,140
-- Well, no, they don't do that now because they don't.
-- No CV E says if it's, if it's real,

265
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:14,710
you get one, if it's not real, you don't. Right.

266
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:18,409
Exactly. But they don't actually do the work to confirm it one way or the other.

267
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:21,030
And it's so people think that they do like people,

268
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,640
I assigned 6000 CV ES

269
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,809
and people were like,

270
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:27,500
what do you mean you didn't test them all? And I'm like, what's 6000 times?

271
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,070
One minute?

272
00:11:28,369 --> 00:11:31,950
-- Like, no, I'm not
-- one minute, hour, an hour or more.

273
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,690
Exactly.

274
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:35,299
-- Right. Assuming I can even stand the product
-- up.

275
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:39,799
That was so it's funny you say that I was talking to some people about

276
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:41,590
vulnerability scanning

277
00:11:41,849 --> 00:11:46,059
and determining false positives where if you vulnerability scan something

278
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,690
and security issues appear and then you have to look

279
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,049
at them and figure out like is this real,

280
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:50,700
is it fake?

281
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,429
And when it's a false positive,

282
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,150
I used to, when I would do this a lot,

283
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:58,830
I would spend an hour or more on each false positive is my estimation.

284
00:11:59,250 --> 00:11:59,679
Like,

285
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,909
yeah, it takes a long time to unp prove something. It's very, very difficult.

286
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:06,070
-- And
-- anyway, well, you're trying to prove a negative. Yeah,

287
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,869
exactly.

288
00:12:07,099 --> 00:12:08,640
So, anyway, here's,

289
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,080
here's my take on this.

290
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:14,880
I'm very happy. This has a CV E ID because now we have a name for it.

291
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:18,809
So if I say, oh, that seven zip issue that was fake,

292
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:21,979
you don't have to say which one or what are you talking about?

293
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,260
You can say, oh, do you mean CV E 2022 29 072.

294
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,190
And I can say yes,

295
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,250
that's the one or let's say another one of these comes out in a couple months now.

296
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,809
-- There's two. Which one are we talking about? What's going on?
-- Because the

297
00:12:34,979 --> 00:12:37,270
github repo says I haven't posted any proof

298
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,669
of concept code anywhere for privilege escalation attack.

299
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:43,570
The POC codes found have nothing to do with privilege escalation for your fix your,

300
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,770
for your information.

301
00:12:44,969 --> 00:12:45,840
So in theory,

302
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:50,090
there should be a real CV at some point for this actual privilege escalation

303
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:54,640
or this existing CV needs to be fixed or something and more to the point like,

304
00:12:54,909 --> 00:12:57,380
yeah, it's at least now it's cataloged, it's public.

305
00:12:57,429 --> 00:12:59,840
But the problem is we can't really interact with it.

306
00:12:59,849 --> 00:13:01,539
Like see if it was in the GSD system.

307
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,799
You could just add some data to your name space and

308
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:05,599
say like here's what I have to say about it.

309
00:13:05,609 --> 00:13:08,010
But with the CV E entry, we have to tweet about it,

310
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,979
put the CV number in it and hope people find it.

311
00:13:10,469 --> 00:13:11,309
Ok. Look,

312
00:13:11,419 --> 00:13:18,020
the, the GSD is compatible with CV E. You can go. So this is CV E 2022 29 072.

313
00:13:18,219 --> 00:13:23,489
You can literally go to the GSD database and this is GSD 2022 29 072.

314
00:13:23,859 --> 00:13:25,570
So anyone could update this today.

315
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,630
But I also don't want to turn this episode

316
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,809
into us complaining CV E sucks and GSD is awesome

317
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:31,700
because

318
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,559
that's already true. So anyway,

319
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,619
-- anyway, well,
-- it's more the, the,

320
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:41,340
the modern world is messier and more complex than ever before and we

321
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:44,809
need to fail gracefully. We can't

322
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,450
like like those 2000 plus vulnerable.

323
00:13:47,479 --> 00:13:48,940
Like maybe it's a vulnerability,

324
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:52,580
maybe it's not a vulnerability from the Linux kernel, but at least now people know

325
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,239
instead of looking at the flood of Linux kernel mailing list,

326
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,830
which is like how many thousands of messages per day or a week versus

327
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,859
like here's 2000 specific things to go look at in whatever interests you,

328
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:07,659
you know, by the device driver or a network thing or whatever file system.

329
00:14:07,669 --> 00:14:10,520
Well, and, and look, I think one of the views I keep

330
00:14:10,979 --> 00:14:12,080
thinking about

331
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,349
in the concept of, of especially vulnerabilities is

332
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,460
there's really two buckets,

333
00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:21,500
there's the stuff you can individually name and worry about.

334
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,690
This is like comparing thunderstorms to hurricanes.

335
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,320
Hurricanes get names for a reason

336
00:14:25,609 --> 00:14:26,590
because it matters.

337
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:30,159
There's literally thunderstorms probably hundreds of them a day across

338
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,159
the planet and no one cares because generally speaking,

339
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:33,390
they're not that big of a deal.

340
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:38,140
And I think most most vulnerabilities are thunderstorms where it's one of those

341
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,479
things like you should be able to look at something and say,

342
00:14:40,489 --> 00:14:43,010
ok, this has four vulnerabilities.

343
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,590
This has

344
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,979
hundreds of vulnerabilities,

345
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:47,190
this has thousands of vulnerabilities and you obviously

346
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,400
need to decide like four is probably fine.

347
00:14:49,409 --> 00:14:51,640
Hundreds uh well, think about that thousands.

348
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,760
Like I need to find a new library, you know,

349
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,409
versus saying I'm going to individually nit pick every one of these things.

350
00:14:57,729 --> 00:15:01,760
But anyway, anyway, I think the thing I want to talk about with our remaining time

351
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:02,919
is

352
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:11,020
this intrigues me because someone put a lot of effort into fooling us all.

353
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,030
Why, why did they do this?

354
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:19,710
See, and this is one of the frustrations I have is who actually requested the CV.

355
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:21,460
It came through the CV form.

356
00:15:21,469 --> 00:15:24,119
I'm pretty sure because it has, you know, miter as the assigner,

357
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,000
but we don't know who actually asked for this.

358
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,659
I mean, was it a third party? Was it the original person?

359
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:32,289
You know, I have had people basically come begging to me

360
00:15:32,489 --> 00:15:34,929
to try and get CV S because they want to pad their resume.

361
00:15:35,729 --> 00:15:36,960
That that's simply it

362
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:38,270
and, and to be fair,

363
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,479
if you find a legitimate vulnerability,

364
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:43,719
I will happily assign it an identifier because like if you want to

365
00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:45,770
gain the system of identifying vulnerabilities

366
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,469
by finding vulnerabilities and identifying them.

367
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:49,849
I'm ok with that.

368
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:50,469
That's

369
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:51,669
kind of the whole point.

370
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,169
But they actually have to be real vulnerabilities.

371
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:57,010
Steve Christie used to call that PHP Golf

372
00:15:57,159 --> 00:16:00,090
where you could basically pick any PHP application

373
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:05,260
-- and find one or more security vulnerabilities in a couple of minutes.
-- Well, like

374
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:08,409
the year, you know, Larry blew up the CV stats.

375
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,020
I mean, that was a good year.

376
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:14,450
He did good work like, and, and now Jonathan Light shoes doing the same thing.

377
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:15,539
Yeah, so to be clear,

378
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:17,229
I'm ok with people getting identifiers

379
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:19,020
for like even wonky little vulnerabilities.

380
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,599
That's great.

381
00:16:20,219 --> 00:16:20,979
Please do that.

382
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,729
But like, yeah, this kind of fake thing that causes, you know,

383
00:16:23,739 --> 00:16:26,440
people having to investigate stuff and deal with it like at

384
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,789
least seven zip isn't like a widely used open source library.

385
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:30,809
So you have all these vendors having to deal with it, you know,

386
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,770
and see if it's vulnerable or not.

387
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,809
And because this is something I often thought about when I worked at Red Hat was

388
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:39,599
if I wanted to like asynchronously attack a security V uh

389
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:42,330
vendor team, how would I do it?

390
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:45,719
And the answer is like lots of fake vulnerabilities

391
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:49,200
because each one of them takes half an hour, an hour, a couple hours to, you know,

392
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,179
prove

393
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,289
negative.

394
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:55,020
And the problem is like you and I can speak from experience,

395
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,260
you can't ignore these strange reports that come in

396
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,539
in broken English saying I found something weird,

397
00:16:59,549 --> 00:17:00,369
blah, blah, blah

398
00:17:00,469 --> 00:17:03,739
because once in a while, yeah, they did find something

399
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,729
-- like, really bad. I, I,
-- I don't think anything should ever be ignored.

400
00:17:07,739 --> 00:17:09,339
I think if someone makes a claim,

401
00:17:09,348 --> 00:17:12,260
even when it's preposterous and you don't think it's real,

402
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:16,060
giving it an identifier makes it easier to deal with in the future.

403
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:17,469
You know what I mean?

404
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:20,569
Just because you can start recording links, you can tell a story here.

405
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:20,750
I mean,

406
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,670
the only details we have now is a Google Doc will

407
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,760
Dorman created like that's kind of nuts if you think about

408
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:30,520
-- it
-- and you know, that should be put in the GSD and that can be put in the GSD.

409
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,750
Yeah, we should probably do that.

410
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,439
There's then that central place for discovery

411
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,939
because that's like that's one thing I did with the log for

412
00:17:37,949 --> 00:17:42,310
J injury is I added tons of Twitter links and added timeline data

413
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,989
which then allowed me to actually build a timeline because

414
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,199
for example, oh yeah, you know,

415
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,660
I found the actual message thread on the

416
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,560
forum discussing this like a week in advance.

417
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:52,030
And then,

418
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:55,300
you know, like that's really useful data, you know,

419
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:00,010
-- understanding this
-- like, so so for people listening, I, I can,

420
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,390
I can contextualize this because literally

421
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:03,790
I spent

422
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:07,920
a probably an hour this morning before work reading all about this

423
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,979
following links trying to put this story together in my head.

424
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:13,150
And then Kurt did the same thing.

425
00:18:13,229 --> 00:18:17,089
And then we even discussed before we hit record, like, oh, what about this?

426
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:19,430
And this and this and this link here and that thing there.

427
00:18:19,569 --> 00:18:19,579
I,

428
00:18:19,589 --> 00:18:23,849
-- I just keep thinking so we did this
-- work and all that data is going to die in our heads.

429
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,949
Yeah, it's in our brains.

430
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:28,709
Which is, I mean, those are terribly worthless places for the most part.

431
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:30,510
And, and if we write it down, that's great.

432
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:32,150
And if you don't write it down,

433
00:18:32,329 --> 00:18:34,800
no one but us benefits.

434
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:38,270
Well, the problem is if you write it down, that's, that's better.

435
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,880
But how do people discover it?

436
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:44,390
Well, yeah. Right. Because obviously like Will's Google Doc.

437
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,020
The only reason we know it's there is because we

438
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,189
follow Will on Twitter and we followed his link.

439
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:50,030
Like there's no other way you'd find it.

440
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:53,420
That's not a sustainable strategy for data management is like, oh,

441
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,410
I find it on Twitter

442
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,040
and then follow the link

443
00:18:56,569 --> 00:19:01,390
right now. Now, right now where we sit today, Twitter is

444
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,910
the fundamental information source for security events and vulnerabilities.

445
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,339
And that is a horrifying thing to think about.

446
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:10,310
I mean,

447
00:19:11,589 --> 00:19:11,619
I,

448
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,410
I mean, I if this is in my slide deck, I talk about this explicitly

449
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,609
that like they like literally we had spontaneous

450
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:22,069
organization on Twitter of hashtag log for J and hashtag log

451
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:22,219
for

452
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:22,739
shell.

453
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:25,270
And without that, that whole thing would have been so much

454
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:26,979
go

455
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:32,410
the dog is the reason log for shell was even semi organized.

456
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:37,109
One person decided to do a bunch of work

457
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:42,229
for free on Twitter and they basically saved us all

458
00:19:42,459 --> 00:19:45,650
to a degree. I mean, and that's, yeah, that's not sustainable or sane.

459
00:19:45,739 --> 00:19:49,079
No, it's ridiculous. Like it's just not efficient.

460
00:19:49,199 --> 00:19:49,449
All right.

461
00:19:49,459 --> 00:19:49,770
And that's,

462
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,130
I think that's what offends me the most is this can be done so much more efficiently.

463
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:53,670
And, you know,

464
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,189
there are literally thousands of people that are gonna have to read the

465
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:58,349
CV E and chew through it and do what we did and,

466
00:19:58,359 --> 00:19:59,459
and arrive at the whole.

467
00:19:59,469 --> 00:20:01,229
Yeah, I can ignore this moving along

468
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,329
and that's a half hour or hour of useful

469
00:20:03,339 --> 00:20:04,849
work they could have been doing on something else.

470
00:20:04,989 --> 00:20:06,130
That's right. That's right.

471
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,369
And now if they do the work and they find a

472
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,969
problem with the CV E getting it updated is terrible.

473
00:20:10,979 --> 00:20:13,290
And, and like that's obviously a whole another problem.

474
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,569
-- It's
-- basically impossible

475
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:15,859
when you learn something.

476
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:17,790
It's very difficult in the world of security

477
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,849
today to distribute your knowledge other than Twitter.

478
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:21,280
Yeah.

479
00:20:21,589 --> 00:20:21,930
It's

480
00:20:22,329 --> 00:20:25,410
once you have like a good hashtag or something, it's nobody can discover it.

481
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,920
Yep. Yep. No, II, I get it. It's, it's hard, man.

482
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:31,689
And one of the things I, I think we,

483
00:20:31,699 --> 00:20:34,079
we like to bash everything because it's kind of what we do.

484
00:20:34,089 --> 00:20:38,849
But I, I also want to be mindful of the fact that none of this is easy to do.

485
00:20:38,859 --> 00:20:40,540
And it requires a

486
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,729
certain amount of knowledge and leadership.

487
00:20:42,739 --> 00:20:44,829
And this is where I give the cloud security lines a ton of

488
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:47,250
credit for being willing to pick this up because it's a very,

489
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,609
very, very hard problem.

490
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,810
And I think historically speaking,

491
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:54,729
we've been able to ignore most of this because the right people

492
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,930
knew how to get in touch with,

493
00:20:56,939 --> 00:20:59,329
with each other and it was mailing lists before Twitter.

494
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:00,329
But I think now

495
00:21:00,579 --> 00:21:02,569
everyone has dispersed

496
00:21:02,849 --> 00:21:05,729
to a degree that it's very difficult

497
00:21:05,739 --> 00:21:08,729
to have these conversations anywhere but Twitter,

498
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,439
there's actually a more subtle aspect to Twitter, which is

499
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:16,579
anybody. Ok. Well, no, I'm gonna say this and this is incorrect.

500
00:21:16,589 --> 00:21:18,510
Anybody can reply to your tweet.

501
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,770
Now, I know that that's incorrect now because you can actually lock down who can

502
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,739
reply to your tweets. You can either have people you follow or people you mention,

503
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:28,160
but generally speaking prior to them implementing that feature whenever they

504
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,699
did a few months or a year ago or whatever.

505
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:34,060
But if I say something on Twitter, people can respond and reply

506
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,160
sure, whether I like it or not. And that's something that

507
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:38,290
doesn't

508
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,660
happen with mailing lists in the sense of

509
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:44,930
you have to be on that mailing list to a know that it exists and to b then reply,

510
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:45,770
right?

511
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,719
And there's a ton of mailing lists and Twitter sort of

512
00:21:48,989 --> 00:21:51,890
is that many to many connective tissue

513
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:55,359
that then allows the for the discovery aspect

514
00:21:55,739 --> 00:21:55,750
I

515
00:21:55,969 --> 00:21:56,020
mean,

516
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,709
in theory, if their algorithm, you know the algorithm, as we all know,

517
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:01,219
the one that showed up on, you know github,

518
00:22:01,709 --> 00:22:04,900
if the algorithm works, you know, it'll show me things that I'm interested in,

519
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:07,060
which would be like, yeah, these kind of security things.

520
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:08,339
Well, and you know,

521
00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:11,219
you know what I'm going to take the off ramp here because you just

522
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:12,660
made me realize something that I think

523
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:15,219
is hugely important to this whole discussion is

524
00:22:15,689 --> 00:22:18,359
historically, when we would talk about a lot of this,

525
00:22:18,719 --> 00:22:21,280
it was all the open source security nerds

526
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:22,729
and we had vendor,

527
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,520
we had OS S security.

528
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,900
You know, we had some of these places we would go

529
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:28,890
and now

530
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,689
if you're a security person,

531
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:34,099
you're also an open source security person, you don't have a choice anymore.

532
00:22:34,469 --> 00:22:39,739
And so I think that the circle has gone from a pretty big circle to

533
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,699
like all the security people.

534
00:22:41,709 --> 00:22:43,900
And I think that's one of the differences now is just the,

535
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:48,989
the ability for these older mailing lists to service everyone is completely out

536
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,300
of the question because a lot of people don't even know they exist.

537
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,479
And so, yeah, Twitter is kind of where we go.

538
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:57,170
-- Well,
-- and there's also the eternal September aspect.

539
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,410
Sure. Right. Yes.

540
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,660
If you have the entire security community show up on OS S security,

541
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,709
it's going to break.

542
00:23:02,739 --> 00:23:05,449
Oh, man, it would be, it'd be a train wreck for sure.

543
00:23:05,459 --> 00:23:08,569
-- Whereas
-- Twitter gives me some reasonable filtering tools by, you know,

544
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:10,040
like I pay attention to Tavis Oram

545
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,930
and to Will Dorman and to these other people.

546
00:23:12,042 --> 00:23:15,863
I think we overestimate the importance of Twitter on a regular basis.

547
00:23:15,873 --> 00:23:19,703
I think Twitter is fun and interesting and it has lots of good stuff on it.

548
00:23:19,713 --> 00:23:23,282
But I bet you the number of actual security people who actually use Twitter

549
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:26,822
is probably like 10 to 15% of the industry is my guess,

550
00:23:26,993 --> 00:23:28,623
not even less than a percent.

551
00:23:28,912 --> 00:23:30,692
Maybe it's a very small number though.

552
00:23:30,703 --> 00:23:32,855
So I think what we look at Twit Twitter and

553
00:23:32,865 --> 00:23:36,196
I think we assume it has an oversized influence.

554
00:23:36,406 --> 00:23:39,556
Well, like everybody in corporate America doing security, they're not on Twitter

555
00:23:39,865 --> 00:23:41,255
like tweeting actively

556
00:23:41,456 --> 00:23:46,586
and, and so what you end up with is the only thing they have today is CV E I DS.

557
00:23:46,605 --> 00:23:49,666
And I think that's why there's such an overemphasis on those

558
00:23:49,676 --> 00:23:52,676
I DS sometimes because it's literally all most people have.

559
00:23:52,949 --> 00:23:54,199
And unfortunately

560
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:57,930
when, when all your only tool is a hammer, everything is a nail.

561
00:23:57,939 --> 00:23:59,930
Well, I mean, I talk about this in my slide deck but yeah,

562
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,890
like we don't have any alternatives.

563
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,680
So it's the only game in town. It's,

564
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:09,250
there are no other public databases, there's just this one and well, now GSD,

565
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,469
there's private databases but they're incomplete and expensive.

566
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:19,000
-- So that's not a solution like to talk about at
-- scale and generally not amazing. No.

567
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:22,770
And so, well, Yeah, we only have one data set to play with.

568
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:26,260
Yeah, I mean, I can't blame people for overly focusing on it.

569
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,819
Part of my concern is, is, you know,

570
00:24:27,829 --> 00:24:32,000
the world has changed so much in the last five years, let alone the last 20.

571
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,469
And that's kind of where I really work like,

572
00:24:35,479 --> 00:24:38,729
and that's one of the fundamental tenants of the GSD is again,

573
00:24:38,869 --> 00:24:42,439
we think we know what some of the answers we want are,

574
00:24:42,459 --> 00:24:45,109
but we're willing to admit we're very wrong.

575
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:49,489
Like a perfect example. I used to think S bombs were something we need

576
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:52,969
and I no longer think that because it's a little more subtle.

577
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:54,650
You don't want an S bomb,

578
00:24:54,819 --> 00:24:58,530
you want to vex, you want the S bomb plus the vulnerability data.

579
00:24:58,739 --> 00:24:59,119
Like

580
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,609
if I, if you give me an S bomb, great.

581
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:04,900
Now I have to do all this work and research to match it up against vulnerabilities.

582
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,329
Well, no, what I want is

583
00:25:06,609 --> 00:25:07,530
that data

584
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:12,170
to begin with? Like I want you to send me the SS bomb with the vulnerability data.

585
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:15,420
-- That's what's valuable that integration piece.
-- OK?

586
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:18,540
So you're on the right track

587
00:25:18,699 --> 00:25:21,180
but you don't know you're going in the wrong direction, I think.

588
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:25,689
So the S bomb is an an unchanging document which

589
00:25:25,699 --> 00:25:27,819
is just the ingredients list fundamentally in the software,

590
00:25:27,829 --> 00:25:28,170
right?

591
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,400
The

592
00:25:29,739 --> 00:25:30,390
that the va

593
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:32,380
is a vulnerability exchange.

594
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:35,430
And what that allows me to do is let's say I take an S bomb,

595
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,380
I can scan the S bomb, right?

596
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,180
This this is kind of a new concept because

597
00:25:39,189 --> 00:25:42,040
generally when we think about scanning things for vulnerabilities,

598
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,849
we like send in

599
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,180
the the client or something

600
00:25:46,609 --> 00:25:48,859
and it goes and looks at what's happening on the

601
00:25:48,869 --> 00:25:50,660
desk and then it comes back with the report.

602
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:53,339
The idea behind the S bomb is you, you have an S bomb

603
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:57,689
and instead of sending in an agent to look at what's going on, you just scan the S bomb.

604
00:25:57,699 --> 00:25:59,280
You say I know everything in the S bomb

605
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,650
compare this to my vulnerability database and tell me what the matches are right

606
00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:08,130
now. Some of those matches are going to have problems for a variety of reasons.

607
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:10,349
It could be things like it's a false positive.

608
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:13,589
I'm not using this library, I'm not using this code.

609
00:26:13,969 --> 00:26:18,750
And so for example, a vex is a way to convey that information of saying, OK,

610
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,150
I have an SM I have a vulnerability scan

611
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,300
and these findings in the vulnerability scan

612
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:28,800
are either lower priority or not affected or whatever.

613
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:31,219
And, and that's functionally what the purpose of the vex is.

614
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,239
Now.

615
00:26:32,489 --> 00:26:37,920
The S bomb never changes. Vulnerability scans can change multiple times a day.

616
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,170
And so what you actually need, you do want an the

617
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:46,189
bomb by itself is basically worthless. It, it, you need to do things with it.

618
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,949
Well, that's what I'm saying is I don't want just the S

619
00:26:48,089 --> 00:26:50,949
bomb. I want, I want somebody else ideally to also do the work.

620
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:51,500
Like ideally,

621
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:54,140
the vendor provides that level because they have the maturity

622
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:56,540
-- to say we scan our stuff for security issues
-- and

623
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,900
you can't trust a scan from a vendor because when did they scan it?

624
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,609
Did they scan it last week? Did they scan it yesterday? Did they scan it an hour ago?

625
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:07,229
And even if they scanned it an hour ago, log for J just happened 25 minutes ago.

626
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,290
So

627
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,040
the vulnerability scan is something that what you want is you want a vendor s

628
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:17,400
bomb that is accurate and good. And then you want to have the ability to scan

629
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:18,170
that S

630
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:23,810
bomb constantly. And then the vendor can also provide vex details as you scan.

631
00:27:24,229 --> 00:27:26,510
So it's this like weird dance

632
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:30,390
and we don't like none of this really exists yet. I should say

633
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:31,790
-- II I, we get
-- at

634
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,030
it like to be clear.

635
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:37,250
S bombs are better than nothing but S bombs are not what I actually want.

636
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,829
What I want is the actual intersection of S bomb and vulnerability data

637
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,500
that's what's used. And the point

638
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:45,650
is if a vendor hands out S bombs,

639
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,859
then all these people have to do the scanning and all that.

640
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:48,869
Whereas if the vendor can

641
00:27:49,074 --> 00:27:49,135
at

642
00:27:49,474 --> 00:27:51,694
least maybe get 80 or 90% of it,

643
00:27:51,805 --> 00:27:53,834
that's a whole lot less work. A lot of people can do.

644
00:27:53,844 --> 00:27:57,844
And more point in theory people can share the the intersection of

645
00:27:57,854 --> 00:28:00,064
SB bomb and vulnerability data in the form of a vex.

646
00:28:00,074 --> 00:28:01,425
You know, they could publish it somewhere.

647
00:28:01,604 --> 00:28:05,814
-- You are in the GSD, for example, you are
-- incorrect in your thinking.

648
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,185
You're thinking

649
00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:10,989
you're, you're, you're bending the old way into the new,

650
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:12,790
what's going to happen

651
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:13,609
is,

652
00:28:13,849 --> 00:28:14,290
yeah,

653
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:17,000
this is weird and hard stuff like

654
00:28:17,209 --> 00:28:19,040
by no means do I expect anyone to?

655
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:19,229
And,

656
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,939
and even the things I'm talking about are going

657
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:24,550
to change as we develop the technology and the concepts

658
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:26,020
what you want to do is you're going to get

659
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,630
multiple S bombs because every time something is updated,

660
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,069
you get a new S bomb, right?

661
00:28:30,489 --> 00:28:32,949
And so really all you want from your vendors is S

662
00:28:33,099 --> 00:28:33,250
bombs.

663
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:36,260
You don't want vulnerability details from them because it's going to change.

664
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,869
-- You want the data. No,
-- I want that as a feed is what I'm saying.

665
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,300
I I'm assuming it's not static.

666
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,989
I'm assuming it's like a live feed like software updates.

667
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,109
Well, every version is, is

668
00:28:46,439 --> 00:28:48,060
frozen in time though

669
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,099
S bombs don't change,

670
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:52,579
right? New versions change,

671
00:28:52,709 --> 00:28:56,040
-- new libraries change
-- like the vulnerability scanning.

672
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:58,239
S bombs can potentially change in the sense of you

673
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,459
get a better s bomb scanner and you just determine

674
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:05,459
-- something that is present, but
-- that's a different problem and yet you are correct.

675
00:29:05,469 --> 00:29:07,339
Ignore that problem for now because it, it,

676
00:29:07,349 --> 00:29:10,260
it makes it very hard and this is spherical cows, right?

677
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:13,560
-- Spherical cows, ok?
-- We'll assume the S bomb is correct spherical

678
00:29:13,569 --> 00:29:14,030
cows and,

679
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:15,770
but then you,

680
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,660
you need to manage them as well because you're

681
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,770
going to have this historical archive of data.

682
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:23,449
You're gonna, I if you have a system with say 10,000,

683
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,449
you know N PM packages in it,

684
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:29,449
which for a modern giant enterprise deployment is not unreasonable.

685
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:33,839
You think basically every one of those packages has an S bomb,

686
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,780
the system as a whole has another S bomb,

687
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,140
that's all that stuff put together plus some other things.

688
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,890
And so you end up with these like layers and

689
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,670
layers of S bombs and everything is changing over time.

690
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,260
So you need the ability to gain insight into the data.

691
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,189
And like part of the insight is going to be vulnerability

692
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:53,060
in the data. Part of the insight is going to be like open source licenses in the data.

693
00:29:53,069 --> 00:29:56,739
Part of it is going to be like what things are, what, which packages are old,

694
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,099
which packages are fresh,

695
00:29:58,329 --> 00:29:59,510
what's going on.

696
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:02,939
I guess what I'm trying to get at is why can't the third party do this and publish it?

697
00:30:02,949 --> 00:30:07,020
-- And that's what I want. I don't want to do the work myself. I just want the data
-- maybe.

698
00:30:07,069 --> 00:30:08,859
But the problem becomes, here's the thing.

699
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:11,219
If I'm a vendor, I create an SBO

700
00:30:11,859 --> 00:30:12,859
and I scan it

701
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,920
and I say here you go, Kurt, here's my scan and my S bomb,

702
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:18,619
-- you can choose to believe me
-- and we're already

703
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,319
light years ahead of where we are today.

704
00:30:20,329 --> 00:30:22,800
Well, I, I won't disagree with that.

705
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:25,880
See, and that's the thing like I'm not asking for. Perfect. I'm just saying

706
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,880
I don't want to redo all this work and have

707
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:31,369
everybody redo all this work that is insanely inefficient.

708
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,319
And maybe

709
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,040
you get it, you get uh in SB

710
00:30:34,189 --> 00:30:34,670
for me,

711
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,670
you get a vulnerability scan from me and the vulnerability

712
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,739
scan can contain vex or whatever it doesn't matter.

713
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:44,199
Now, you have to keep asking me for vulnerability scan details constantly. Right?

714
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:44,439
Well, yeah,

715
00:30:44,449 --> 00:30:47,640
I assume it's like a feed because you're a mature vendor who does this on the regular,

716
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:48,310
just like you

717
00:30:48,449 --> 00:30:51,250
regularly do updates and find vulnerabilities.

718
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,829
-- You're
-- almost there, you're almost there.

719
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:58,030
If you're already constantly pulling in vulnerability details from a vendor,

720
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,290
you have to do this on a completely regular basis

721
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:03,160
and then you're gonna need a tool to manage the results

722
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,640
of the vulnerability details you're pulling in from a vendor.

723
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,150
Like

724
00:31:06,619 --> 00:31:08,300
if you already have this tool

725
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,880
and you're already trying to manage this information

726
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,170
and you're already trying to wrangle it.

727
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:12,869
Like

728
00:31:13,479 --> 00:31:16,619
why are you pulling it from the vendor? You just freaking run it yourself.

729
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:19,420
You already have to have a tool to do this work.

730
00:31:19,689 --> 00:31:21,449
I don't understand why you would want to

731
00:31:21,459 --> 00:31:24,819
trust their vulnerability scan necessarily or you could take

732
00:31:24,829 --> 00:31:27,939
it from them and you could do one yourself and then you could compare them as well,

733
00:31:27,949 --> 00:31:30,119
-- to see if they're making crap up one
-- comment.

734
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,400
So you would trust,

735
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:34,069
you would trust the vendor to download and run their software,

736
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:37,000
but you wouldn't trust the vendor to provide a security statement about it.

737
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:39,469
Like, do you see there's a, a bit of a disconnect there.

738
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:43,280
Have you ever dealt with vendors and security statements?

739
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:45,020
They are

740
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:49,630
-- often hilariously wrong.
-- Why do you think I moved everything to the cloud?

741
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:53,459
But the problem is you just moved your risk to someone else and

742
00:31:53,469 --> 00:31:56,270
that someone else could be a complete idiot and you have no idea.

743
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:58,750
So that while, while effective is,

744
00:31:58,869 --> 00:32:00,060
well as it turns out, GH

745
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:00,449
and Hiroko,

746
00:32:00,979 --> 00:32:03,510
-- that is an excuse.
-- But see, that's the thing.

747
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,030
Yeah, that's exactly what I did and it worked,

748
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,390
it did work. I'm not gonna say it doesn't work.

749
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,780
I'm just saying, you know, if you're fundamentally all of this,

750
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,140
everything we're talking about

751
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,150
is about managing risk

752
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:18,439
and if, if your risk appetite says I'm just gonna tell

753
00:32:18,619 --> 00:32:19,780
her to the cloud. I don't care.

754
00:32:19,969 --> 00:32:21,699
There's absolutely nothing wrong with that.

755
00:32:21,709 --> 00:32:22,939
And that's a decision you can make,

756
00:32:22,949 --> 00:32:27,880
-- but not everyone will make that decision
-- challenges for us to insource

757
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:32,560
the risk management would require a level of effort and expertise.

758
00:32:32,569 --> 00:32:36,949
-- We need 5 to 10 full time people.
-- I, I understand that, but this isn't for you either.

759
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:40,550
You keep, you always conflate these hard problems into, well at the CS A.

760
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,439
We don't worry about that because, but

761
00:32:42,569 --> 00:32:45,859
-- that's not valid. No,
-- no, it's not that we don't worry about it. It's not.

762
00:32:45,989 --> 00:32:47,119
No, no, no, I'm saying,

763
00:32:47,239 --> 00:32:49,640
I'm saying I can't worry about

764
00:32:49,949 --> 00:32:49,969
it.

765
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:52,569
Why not? That's fine. This is like me trying to solve global warming.

766
00:32:52,869 --> 00:32:52,890
I

767
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,420
let me, let me, let me rephrase this.

768
00:32:55,729 --> 00:32:56,959
Would you be comfortable

769
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,260
having

770
00:32:58,459 --> 00:33:00,209
one of your cloud providers? Github

771
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:03,439
saying? Oh, we just outsourced our risk to

772
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:05,469
Amazon because that's where we run our cloud.

773
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:05,939
Yeah.

774
00:33:06,209 --> 00:33:08,739
-- Right. That's ridiculous.
-- Because what's my alternative?

775
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:12,319
-- No, they scan their freaking software. But
-- what's my alternative?

776
00:33:12,339 --> 00:33:14,900
No, you're, you're, you're being purposely

777
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:15,810
confusing.

778
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:19,949
The reality is when you have a cloud provider, you better hope

779
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,949
they're paying attention to what's in their stuff.

780
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:24,260
You better hope they're keeping up on what the vulnerability Du Jour

781
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,880
is. You better hope they're keeping up on the code they're writing

782
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:32,150
-- because if they're not, they're going to get hacked 100%.
-- Essentially. Hiroko

783
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:32,619
and github

784
00:33:32,949 --> 00:33:34,589
are quite competent and large

785
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:39,829
and even they had a, a hack that was so invasive and large that they're,

786
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:41,280
they're forcing a global password

787
00:33:41,489 --> 00:33:42,729
set for all their customers.

788
00:33:42,829 --> 00:33:45,010
They've invalidated all the tokens and not allowed

789
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,910
us to use tokens for like three weeks

790
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:47,750
and

791
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:51,739
-- they insourced all that risk and here we are.
-- No, they didn't insource all the risk.

792
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,260
They're providing a service and they have a

793
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:55,890
competent security team that identified a problem and

794
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,829
the competent security team took the necessary actions

795
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:00,939
to remediate that problem for the customers.

796
00:34:00,949 --> 00:34:03,550
In this particular case, it was a very,

797
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,709
they definitely took the sledge hammer to the wall for this one.

798
00:34:06,939 --> 00:34:11,179
But the point is you can't just keep harping about outsourcing risk when the fact

799
00:34:11,188 --> 00:34:14,570
is you did outsource a risk and the competent security team dealt with it.

800
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:17,010
And this is true of dealing with like s

801
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,489
bombs and vulnerabilities and vexes and things is,

802
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,639
it has to, you have to do this work at some point.

803
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:26,478
No, you don't. A lot of people don't have the budget or resources to do this.

804
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:29,228
-- Ok?
-- You're thinking about this from the opposite end.

805
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:31,958
I am, I'm thinking about this from the standpoint of I am

806
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:32,110
a

807
00:34:32,458 --> 00:34:35,989
providing a service to someone else because those are the people I interact with.

808
00:34:35,998 --> 00:34:38,678
I think we exist on two different ends of the spectrum.

809
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:40,039
You're talking about

810
00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:41,898
the companies looking for services.

811
00:34:41,908 --> 00:34:44,549
I'm talking about the companies providing services if I'm

812
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:47,188
working with a company providing services and they're like,

813
00:34:47,197 --> 00:34:48,618
we don't care

814
00:34:48,748 --> 00:34:49,029
too

815
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:50,949
about SBO

816
00:34:51,228 --> 00:34:53,540
or vulnerabilities or any of that, none of it matters.

817
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:57,659
I'm gonna be like you have a great day, sir. And I'm gonna go find a company that does

818
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,179
and I,

819
00:34:58,189 --> 00:34:59,860
I have actually had that experience where we're

820
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:02,360
dealing with third party plugins for airable.com.

821
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,550
And this one seems to be one person, you know,

822
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,020
running the thing off of a firebase without even a custom domain name.

823
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:11,909
And um they wanted a super admin access to our Google account to do the integration.

824
00:35:11,919 --> 00:35:15,030
-- And I'm like, nope, we can't do that. It,
-- the point is all of this.

825
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,340
I'm ending this show because we're dragging on

826
00:35:17,479 --> 00:35:19,850
the point is all of this stuff is just data.

827
00:35:19,979 --> 00:35:23,530
And we've reached a point where you have two choices in the industry.

828
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,360
You can incorporate data into your process

829
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:27,969
and use it to make intelligent decisions,

830
00:35:27,979 --> 00:35:28,850
which is fundamentally

831
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:29,229
epo

832
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:32,540
and vulnerability and vex are just all part of that data or

833
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:35,239
you can say I don't have the resources to deal with this.

834
00:35:35,389 --> 00:35:37,620
I'm going to outsource my

835
00:35:37,989 --> 00:35:40,810
work and trust and risk and all of that to

836
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,219
some other organization and there's nothing wrong with that.

837
00:35:43,229 --> 00:35:45,820
But I think we have to recognize that there's a place for all of it,

838
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:50,159
given X number of S bombs and X number of interactions at some point,

839
00:35:50,169 --> 00:35:53,889
this stuff has to be outsourced to companies that specialize in this because the,

840
00:35:53,899 --> 00:35:56,919
the expertise and resourcing needed to do this properly

841
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:59,459
is going to grow exponentially.

842
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:01,300
Yes, I, I, I agree.

843
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:06,540
-- I work for a company that provides services and products to do literally
-- this.

844
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:07,469
Yeah, exactly.

845
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:10,530
I don't think anyone is arguing at that. That point is fair.

846
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,080
I hope what's going to happen is

847
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,659
rather than me run it that well,

848
00:36:14,669 --> 00:36:18,010
you run it as a service or you enable an ecosystem that allows

849
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,139
people to run it as service and do it properly because I don't want

850
00:36:21,419 --> 00:36:25,600
10 million companies having to set up C I CD pipelines to do security scanning.

851
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:28,139
-- I,
-- I want all of my vendors to do it though.

852
00:36:28,429 --> 00:36:29,620
That's the difference.

853
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,969
We're talking about two different problems. You're talking about the consumers.

854
00:36:32,979 --> 00:36:37,270
I'm talking about the producers. I'm not going to use a service provider

855
00:36:37,399 --> 00:36:40,139
that doesn't do this kind of stuff internally.

856
00:36:40,469 --> 00:36:41,169
Well,

857
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:42,830
ok, I can agree with that.

858
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:47,350
I would point out 11 point that there is the in house stuff that they build,

859
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,320
that they need to scan themselves because who else is gonna do that?

860
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:49,860
Right. Like

861
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,399
that's the point of being a service provider. You're providing a service.

862
00:36:54,409 --> 00:36:55,040
Well, but,

863
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:58,929
but like that code that you write is 1% of your overall code base,

864
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,790
-- right? The rest
-- is

865
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:00,159
the

866
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:00,320
file

867
00:37:00,439 --> 00:37:02,530
-- open source that you pulled in,
-- correct.

868
00:37:03,209 --> 00:37:06,159
-- And I better know what that is.
-- Let me ask you this.

869
00:37:06,169 --> 00:37:08,870
What would you prefer a vendor that does it themselves or a vendor that

870
00:37:08,879 --> 00:37:11,500
outsources it to a massive company that is known to do it really?

871
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,389
Well, that's an idiot question.

872
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:17,649
I want a vendor who knows what's in their stuff, how they get that list, be it.

873
00:37:17,659 --> 00:37:19,870
They're running a code scanner themselves, be it.

874
00:37:19,879 --> 00:37:23,909
They're working with some other company that built the code scanner is irrelevant.

875
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,300
If you're my vendor and you don't know what's in your stuff,

876
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,879
you're not going to be my vendor.

877
00:37:28,969 --> 00:37:29,239
Ok.

878
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,729
So I think that's what I'm not saying that they shouldn't know what's in their stuff.

879
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:34,379
I'm saying that generally speaking, this stuff will end up being outsourced.

880
00:37:34,389 --> 00:37:35,020
It has to be

881
00:37:35,129 --> 00:37:38,179
because the level of complexity and resources needed to do this correctly

882
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:41,360
is like apart from Amazon Microsoft and Google,

883
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:43,050
nobody else is going to be able to do it correctly.

884
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:46,399
-- All right,
-- I'm not gonna argue with you anymore and you're not wrong,

885
00:37:46,409 --> 00:37:48,040
you're not wrong anyway, I'm ending it.

886
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:48,780
Thank you, Kurt.

887
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:49,330
What I'm saying

888
00:37:50,219 --> 00:37:50,239
it

889
00:37:50,439 --> 00:37:50,719
