00:00:05,659 --> 00:00:08,640
Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,649 --> 00:00:11,170
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:11,329 --> 00:00:13,600
All right. So take two again.

3
00:00:13,869 --> 00:00:14,270
But

4
00:00:14,399 --> 00:00:17,850
so the I I want to cover this quickly and I do not want us to dwell on it.

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,420
And actually the last thing we recorded, we spent too much time on it.

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,110
So that's great.

7
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,879
So I've had a number of people contact me about the Twitter

8
00:00:25,889 --> 00:00:30,750
hacking incident where about 100 and 30 accounts were compromised and this,

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,799
this attacker basically used it to try to get Bitcoin out of

10
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,849
people and they made about 100 and 30 K is my understanding,

11
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,610
give or take.

12
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:39,610
And

13
00:00:40,209 --> 00:00:43,389
uh people are saying, why did the attacker only do this?

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,409
And why didn't they do something

15
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:47,229
more interesting and potentially more profitable?

16
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,150
And my response has been,

17
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,560
most criminals are idiots and this person was clearly no exception.

18
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,130
So that's pretty much it.

19
00:00:57,139 --> 00:01:00,159
Well, and I love that they, they, it's not that they hacked 100 and 30 accounts.

20
00:01:00,169 --> 00:01:02,500
They hacked a management interface that had

21
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:05,480
apparently access to like all the verified accounts

22
00:01:05,809 --> 00:01:08,089
with. And apparently Twitter has like multiple levels of this.

23
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:09,440
So it's like dumb schmucks like us,

24
00:01:09,449 --> 00:01:12,279
there's verified accounts with the little blue check or whatever.

25
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,139
There's like the ultra secure verified can't be abused accounts.

26
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:16,550
Like, you know,

27
00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:18,080
apparently the president of the United States thinks

28
00:01:18,089 --> 00:01:19,470
Twitter is a place to send out policy.

29
00:01:19,722 --> 00:01:20,071
So,

30
00:01:21,802 --> 00:01:24,162
I mean, uh yeah, anyways

31
00:01:24,311 --> 00:01:28,781
anyway. So, yeah. No. And, and you're right, like smart criminals either.

32
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:31,192
Well, smart, really smart criminals do one of two things.

33
00:01:31,202 --> 00:01:33,872
They either do white collar crime because that stuff almost never gets

34
00:01:33,882 --> 00:01:37,211
punished and when it does get punished it's like google the term,

35
00:01:37,372 --> 00:01:42,122
you know, the sec, uh, fined by the sec but admitted no wrongdoing.

36
00:01:42,961 --> 00:01:44,111
You know, like that's

37
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:47,531
the kind of white collar crime you want to be doing. If you're smart or number two

38
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:50,984
you do stuff that isn't crime yet and, and that can be like,

39
00:01:50,994 --> 00:01:52,783
really hyper aggressive sales.

40
00:01:52,793 --> 00:01:56,683
Like, I'm sure we've all met some sales people that are like, pretty scary or,

41
00:01:56,694 --> 00:01:59,363
you know, they just, they invent new financial instruments that.

42
00:01:59,374 --> 00:02:00,103
Right. Right.

43
00:02:00,113 --> 00:02:02,143
Well, it's not a crime because the, you know,

44
00:02:02,153 --> 00:02:05,863
we never had outer space alien fungible tokens before.

45
00:02:05,874 --> 00:02:07,893
And the beauty of being legitimate is you don't

46
00:02:07,903 --> 00:02:10,502
have to launder your money or fence your stuff.

47
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:11,104
So

48
00:02:11,324 --> 00:02:14,264
it's, yeah. Anyway, anyway, I don't want to dwell on it.

49
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,613
No, the whole thing is just, it's,

50
00:02:15,983 --> 00:02:18,666
you know what it really reminds me of is the whole, remember when DD and esco

51
00:02:19,026 --> 00:02:21,546
denial of service down in the Mar I bought net.

52
00:02:21,555 --> 00:02:23,925
We thought, oh my God, it's this massive state level actress thing.

53
00:02:24,026 --> 00:02:24,455
And you know what?

54
00:02:24,466 --> 00:02:25,936
It turned out to be three college

55
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,975
students that were doing Minecraft server extortion.

56
00:02:28,156 --> 00:02:28,776
It boils down.

57
00:02:29,345 --> 00:02:30,345
You have a Minecraft server.

58
00:02:30,356 --> 00:02:32,335
It'd be an awful shame if it fell over,

59
00:02:32,345 --> 00:02:34,425
you should pay us some money and some guy didn't.

60
00:02:34,436 --> 00:02:35,735
So they dosed his D

61
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:37,136
DNS provider and

62
00:02:37,305 --> 00:02:37,666
like,

63
00:02:37,675 --> 00:02:39,645
literally everybody thought it was like China or

64
00:02:39,656 --> 00:02:41,695
Russia testing out some new cyber weapon.

65
00:02:41,705 --> 00:02:43,546
-- It's like, no, just a bunch of college students.
-- That's

66
00:02:45,386 --> 00:02:45,656
right.

67
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,520
Honestly, if somebody wrote this and made this movie, I'd be like,

68
00:02:49,529 --> 00:02:51,639
that's some truly crap script writing.

69
00:02:51,649 --> 00:02:52,800
Like they are not trying.

70
00:02:53,529 --> 00:02:55,100
I agree. I agree completely.

71
00:02:55,389 --> 00:02:56,580
-- Yeah. Good
-- times.

72
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:58,179
It's

73
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:01,660
uh well, and, and this is what this is directly, what feeds today's show.

74
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:04,660
Today's show is sort of about that whole attention economy thing.

75
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,149
What's,

76
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,309
what's fascinating to me is you have all these super high tech companies

77
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,860
that are doing like tons of machine learning and A I and like,

78
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:14,419
Facebook has their own data centers and not just like a few little ones but

79
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,360
massive data centers, you know, their own open.

80
00:03:17,369 --> 00:03:19,610
What is it, the open hardware thing with like those, you know,

81
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:22,149
it's this like rack design where there's no power supply,

82
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,699
there's just like these three scary copper bars at

83
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,979
the back that like if you touch them,

84
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,380
you will die because it's something like it's like

85
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:31,399
12 volts at like 400 amps or something ridiculous.

86
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:32,610
And like

87
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,300
the,

88
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:38,500
the way they monetize all this is by taking your attention and trying to show you ads.

89
00:03:39,369 --> 00:03:40,160
And so

90
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:42,660
there's a fascinating thing that has just come out recently.

91
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:46,309
It's the new GP T three A I that generates text.

92
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,240
You should explain this because I wouldn't even say it just generates text.

93
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,320
-- Like I can generate text.
-- So

94
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,139
true. Like we've had ways for computers to generate text.

95
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:58,800
But what's special of this one is you feed it a bunch

96
00:03:58,809 --> 00:04:01,320
of text like that you wrote or somebody else wrote or,

97
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:01,679
you know,

98
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:05,789
of scientific papers and it basically spits out new content

99
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,669
that is similar to the old content but is well,

100
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:09,350
it's new

101
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:12,990
and it, it really does appear to have been written by a human.

102
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,029
It does tend to have uh where it starts out,

103
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,200
it says something interesting and then it just sort of trails off

104
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:20,730
and goes off on tangents and never reaches a conclusion because,

105
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,100
you know, it's not sentient in the sense of thinking and analyzing these ideas.

106
00:04:25,109 --> 00:04:27,739
It's just literally constructing grammatically

107
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,850
correct sentences that also kind of

108
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,510
-- have all the right words.
-- I would, I would argue that

109
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,230
sports writing

110
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,760
-- is this.
-- Well, sports writing has already been automated this way.

111
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:41,630
Baseball games and a couple other sports are in the process.

112
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,049
There's a company that does this now

113
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,700
-- that doesn't surprise me
-- and has been doing this

114
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:47,899
for one or two years and even adds backstory.

115
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,989
So, like, when they see these two teams playing each other,

116
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,429
they'll talk about their historical rivalry or whatever,

117
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,709
you know, because, yeah, I mean, no offense. There's no

118
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,350
so many ways to report on a sports ball game.

119
00:04:57,529 --> 00:04:58,540
-- Right.
-- Exactly.

120
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:03,109
That's what I always feel like any time I happen upon a story about sports,

121
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:07,559
it's just a lot of, you could have written it in four sentences instead,

122
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,549
I'm reading three paragraphs.

123
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,510
-- Yeah,
-- I mean, the winning team obviously gave 100 and 10%

124
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:14,260
and the losing team.

125
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,119
Well, they didn't.

126
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:19,179
Yeah, they suck more. It definitely wasn't. Mostly luck. And, yeah.

127
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,709
Anyway, anyway,

128
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,559
no, that's, that's cool.

129
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:27,440
What's, what's fascinating like, so there's a GP T two which generated text,

130
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,440
you know, but, and it was kind of noticeably you could

131
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,760
iff it out after a while,

132
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:36,640
but GP T three, they basically trained it on like 100 times more data or whatever,

133
00:05:36,744 --> 00:05:36,984
you know.

134
00:05:36,994 --> 00:05:40,454
It's, it's a lot more sophisticated and it does a much better job and it's,

135
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:43,605
it's not open sourced unfortunately, although it might be at some point,

136
00:05:43,614 --> 00:05:46,125
even though the organization is called the Open A

137
00:05:46,234 --> 00:05:46,445
I

138
00:05:47,274 --> 00:05:52,684
-- kind of the biggest naming scam ever. In my opinion.
-- It's like wikileaks, not a wiki.

139
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,470
Yeah.

140
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,829
Like they, they open A, I started with the premise of we will be opening, you know,

141
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,579
advanced A, I, and people won't have to re invent the wheel secretly.

142
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:00,950
And,

143
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,250
yeah, I know. That's not how that turned out.

144
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,980
But, yeah, it's fascinating because this guy wrote a

145
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,329
blog entry and it sort of starts out, like, ok,

146
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:12,380
and then it just sort of gets a little weird and

147
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:17,420
-- honestly I've, I've read words, things from actual humans. I've
-- read much worse.

148
00:06:17,429 --> 00:06:18,450
So there's,

149
00:06:18,549 --> 00:06:21,100
there's an article we will put in the show notes

150
00:06:21,109 --> 00:06:23,940
that Kurt sent to me and you read the article

151
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,660
and

152
00:06:24,809 --> 00:06:27,660
I won't say it's, it's bad. It's not good.

153
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,720
It's, it's an article,

154
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:33,380
it's what I would expect on the internet for your typical news story.

155
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,529
And then basically at the end, the guy says

156
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,420
I didn't write this, the A I wrote it.

157
00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:42,579
Here's what I gave the A I and this article is what it popped out. And

158
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,690
it was fascinating to me that

159
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,209
an A I could be, I would say this

160
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,730
acceptable.

161
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:51,929
You know what I mean?

162
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,230
Yeah. And what's really fascinating was like the hacker news thread on it.

163
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:55,489
You know,

164
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,970
because as one point person pointed out it's really clear who just read the title,

165
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,299
who read one or two paragraphs and who read the whole thing.

166
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:04,929
Ah, interesting. But, I mean, that's the thing, right? We are literally in

167
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,130
the Clickbait era of

168
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,519
the internet,

169
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:11,209
right? You know, things go viral, whatever

170
00:07:11,429 --> 00:07:14,609
and getting those attention tokens points,

171
00:07:14,619 --> 00:07:17,970
whatever and trying to convert them into money by shoving ads down your face.

172
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,209
Sadly, I mean,

173
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:19,570
you know,

174
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:22,790
that's what blows my mind if you had told me back when I started using the internet,

175
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:23,170
that,

176
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:23,730
you know,

177
00:07:23,739 --> 00:07:25,470
the way companies are going to monetize this all

178
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,079
is by trying to shove ads down your face.

179
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:27,859
I would have been, like,

180
00:07:27,869 --> 00:07:29,790
at first I would have been horrified and then I would have been, well, you know,

181
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:32,269
that's every broadcast media thing ever.

182
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,350
So, yeah, that makes sense. Like, think about it. Right.

183
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:37,320
Have, how else have, you know, newspapers, TV,

184
00:07:37,454 --> 00:07:38,195
movies,

185
00:07:38,475 --> 00:07:39,464
product placement.

186
00:07:39,475 --> 00:07:42,475
Like that's just, that's the best thing people have figured out.

187
00:07:42,885 --> 00:07:43,785
Yes.

188
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,195
So, and what I really love to on a side note is, you know,

189
00:07:46,204 --> 00:07:48,964
all those major advertisers leaving Facebook and I don't

190
00:07:48,975 --> 00:07:50,635
think they're going to be coming back anytime soon.

191
00:07:50,644 --> 00:07:55,704
I mean, so my argument here and this is sort of a tangent.

192
00:07:55,714 --> 00:07:59,345
So I, I think I've talked about this before on the podcast, but

193
00:07:59,464 --> 00:08:03,234
I run a handful of sites and obviously one of them is this podcast.

194
00:08:03,244 --> 00:08:07,100
And so I have various statistics about how people are getting to us,

195
00:08:07,109 --> 00:08:08,660
how people are exiting us.

196
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:10,970
And obviously there's always show notes.

197
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,760
We'll put things like on Twitter. Well, you know, whatever.

198
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,339
And I can tell you now that the click through of all of that stuff is garbage.

199
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,380
It is, it is effectively zero.

200
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,549
And I would be shocked if Facebook ads have any

201
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:27,760
actual return on investment because I have a strong suspicion.

202
00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:31,100
The vast majority of people on Facebook are already so, like,

203
00:08:31,109 --> 00:08:33,820
blind to what's going on around them.

204
00:08:33,869 --> 00:08:36,034
Just because that's kind of the nature of social media.

205
00:08:36,044 --> 00:08:38,085
Let's get your attention and then just like,

206
00:08:38,094 --> 00:08:41,125
let's spoon feed you garbage and you don't even realize it.

207
00:08:41,224 --> 00:08:41,354
Yeah.

208
00:08:41,364 --> 00:08:44,645
Well, I mean, the classic thing with advertising, right is, you know, that I,

209
00:08:44,655 --> 00:08:46,354
half my advertising is wasted.

210
00:08:46,364 --> 00:08:47,405
I just don't know which half I

211
00:08:47,565 --> 00:08:48,734
think it's actually a lot more than that.

212
00:08:48,864 --> 00:08:52,244
Then the argument turns to all the whole, well, brand recognition.

213
00:08:52,255 --> 00:08:54,284
You know, you're in the supermarket, you have to choose Coke or Pepsi.

214
00:08:54,294 --> 00:08:55,905
You're like, I've never heard of Pepsi, but, hey,

215
00:08:55,914 --> 00:08:58,465
Coke is a familiar brand because I saw it on TV, once.

216
00:08:58,474 --> 00:09:02,674
Like my favorite thing is always advertising for gas stations because I literally,

217
00:09:03,099 --> 00:09:05,619
I'm just driving and I'm like, oh, that one's a penny cheaper than that one.

218
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,369
-- I'm going to that
-- one.

219
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,010
I don't even do that. I just think, oh, I need gas. There's a gas station.

220
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,520
Well,

221
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:15,059
here we tend to like here the closest gas station to me is literally

222
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,390
always 5 to 10 cents higher than the one that's like three blocks further.

223
00:09:19,109 --> 00:09:21,289
Super bizarre, but like, consistently.

224
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:25,869
-- Yeah, I filled up there once or twice and then I'm driving,
-- it's probably less busy.

225
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:27,059
I don't know, man.

226
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:31,440
But, um, but to me, as far as I know gas is, is fungible.

227
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,359
And, like, I put gas in my car and as long as I don't put diesel in my car,

228
00:09:34,369 --> 00:09:35,169
I think we're ok.

229
00:09:36,229 --> 00:09:39,710
The problem though with advertising is if you did zero advertising and, uh,

230
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:42,260
you know, you're up against a company like Coca Cola that does

231
00:09:42,489 --> 00:09:45,409
tens or whatever, billions of dollars of advertising. A,

232
00:09:45,534 --> 00:09:45,575
yeah,

233
00:09:45,804 --> 00:09:49,434
you're going to get stomped in the mass market, sort of.

234
00:09:49,445 --> 00:09:52,625
But on the flip side, you know, for smaller companies,

235
00:09:52,724 --> 00:09:56,034
-- I can't imagine advertising working all that
-- well,

236
00:09:56,244 --> 00:09:57,364
I mean, it's going to depend,

237
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,515
there's a million things to talk about here and

238
00:09:59,525 --> 00:10:01,734
none of them are related to security really.

239
00:10:01,895 --> 00:10:04,715
Well, it's what's fascinating to me is we have this attention based economy

240
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,309
and now we have ways to programmatically

241
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,679
generate stuff to grab people's attention.

242
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:16,780
We've already seen that with videos on youtube where people generate really cheap,

243
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:18,020
low end kids content.

244
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,960
Like to the point of that kid called

245
00:10:19,969 --> 00:10:22,150
Evan in California who's apparently a multimillionaire,

246
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:25,219
even though he's not even like 10 years old and he literally opens

247
00:10:25,229 --> 00:10:27,960
up boxes of toys and plays with them and talks about it.

248
00:10:28,049 --> 00:10:30,099
Well, that's, that's real content though.

249
00:10:30,109 --> 00:10:34,099
I mean, you can argue it's, it's crap and it might be but

250
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,530
like this is nothing like the machine generated

251
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:39,239
-- content that is out there
-- but where there

252
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,210
is machine generated content on youtube in the

253
00:10:41,219 --> 00:10:43,309
form of cartoons and remixes and stuff.

254
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,659
Yeah, I know there's tons of it.

255
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:47,619
So one of the things my daughter loves to do, my daughter is 11

256
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,669
and she will, she'll tell me, oh, I'm going to go watch some meme

257
00:10:50,849 --> 00:10:53,419
which at first I'm like, what? That doesn't make sense.

258
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,400
But so what people do is they basically go on to Reddit,

259
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,820
they download the meme images,

260
00:10:58,979 --> 00:11:00,739
they play background music

261
00:11:00,989 --> 00:11:05,380
and then they display memes like 10 seconds of meme for, you know, make,

262
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,940
make like a 10 minute video out of it.

263
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:10,479
You think about that's literally zero human interaction. Zero effort.

264
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:13,059
-- Yeah,
-- I just, I just googled, watch some memes. And

265
00:11:13,469 --> 00:11:15,280
exactly what you're describing is what showed up.

266
00:11:15,289 --> 00:11:18,479
I mean, because I've seen the thing on, on youtube where like they have Reddit

267
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,549
reading out like the top stuff from like relationship advice or

268
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:24,299
all the train wreck stories and like some of the responses

269
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,150
and they just have like a computer, read it out, like

270
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,530
text to speech

271
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,119
and it's got like some

272
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,270
random background, but this is a whole new level of, wow.

273
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,169
But now here's so here's the question

274
00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:38,710
she enjoys doing this.

275
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:43,710
-- Is there anything wrong with providing people what they want?
-- No.

276
00:11:43,719 --> 00:11:45,950
Well, do people actually want this

277
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,659
-- because
-- she does,

278
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:51,179
well, people eat too much fast food and junk food, right?

279
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:54,229
People want a lot of bad things, people want to smoke, people want to drink too much.

280
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,429
People want meth, you know,

281
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,869
some of these things we've decided are illegal like meth, but, you know,

282
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,900
some like smoking,

283
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,630
we still allow that and it's pretty clear it's not good for you.

284
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:06,830
So, I, I don't know if that's a, a reasonable comparison here

285
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:08,059
because

286
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,369
I, for example, love going to Reddit

287
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:16,679
and paging through the crap memes. Nothing pleases me more than doing that.

288
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:17,000
I mean,

289
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,239
is it any worse than spending four hours watching a

290
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,609
football game on Sunday that has six minutes of action?

291
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,859
I would argue. No.

292
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:29,989
So I, I get it, people want to sit down and kind of just waste their time mentally and,

293
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,669
and I do that too.

294
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,030
Like I also read Reddit and

295
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:33,799
you know, various other time wasting.

296
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:37,070
Like I watched, well, I don't watch TV, TV, I watch Netflix.

297
00:12:37,729 --> 00:12:38,719
You know, which by definition,

298
00:12:38,729 --> 00:12:40,489
if you're not watching some enlightening documentary,

299
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,270
you're basically just kind of wasting time.

300
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:42,669
But I mean,

301
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:44,510
going to the theater is that

302
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,309
also wasting time? Well,

303
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,489
to some degree? Yeah, and that's fine.

304
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,969
But the problem is, you know,

305
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:51,330
we're getting to this point where once

306
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,109
we get this programmatically generated content,

307
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,989
my fear is that it takes the money away from

308
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,250
the things that are a bit more interesting and useful because

309
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,169
one thing I'm seeing with all this programmatically generated content

310
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:05,150
is that they actually don't generate the content by and large, right?

311
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:09,049
They take like this meme thing, it just downloads stuff from Reddit, which is people

312
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,250
or you know, the remixes or the,

313
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,929
well, the articles about a baseball game, like it didn't create the baseball game,

314
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,090
it's

315
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:16,840
reported it.

316
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,159
That's

317
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:17,330
right.

318
00:13:17,549 --> 00:13:17,900
And

319
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,700
we will.

320
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:23,059
So humanity has generated an enormous corpus of content

321
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,219
that these like a is can draw on.

322
00:13:25,229 --> 00:13:28,619
You start getting into some weird questions when like the A I is using other A

323
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,979
I generated content and that's probably going to

324
00:13:30,989 --> 00:13:32,700
start getting weird and crazy and stuff.

325
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,049
But

326
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,609
I, I feel like

327
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:38,700
I want to bring this up one more level from where we're at because I

328
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:43,789
think we could whinge all day on wasting time on Reddit or youtube or whatever.

329
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:44,479
And

330
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,760
I feel like from the perspective of

331
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,580
-- capturing attention is a better discussion, I think and,
-- and, you know,

332
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:55,880
this is something that Facebook has been accused of algorithmically, you know,

333
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:58,349
and, and kids games are doing this now where they're, you know,

334
00:13:58,359 --> 00:14:00,940
working really hard to use psychological tricks

335
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,030
to take people's attention and monetize it

336
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:07,630
and, you know, do some really psychologically unhealthy things, you know, like,

337
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,630
well, the current thing, the doom scrolling.

338
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:12,640
Yeah. Oh, doom scrolling is a lovely term

339
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,099
for what's going on. Yeah.

340
00:14:14,109 --> 00:14:17,200
Where you're just on this, like infinite news feed, web page that, you know,

341
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,960
you keep scrolling down and just reading.

342
00:14:19,789 --> 00:14:20,200
Well, I mean,

343
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:22,950
so far has there been any good news in 2020?

344
00:14:23,099 --> 00:14:24,359
I can't think of any

345
00:14:24,922 --> 00:14:25,752
if there's any,

346
00:14:25,922 --> 00:14:28,232
I mean, Australia stopped being on fire but

347
00:14:28,572 --> 00:14:29,013
-- no
-- one,

348
00:14:29,023 --> 00:14:32,062
-- no one remembers
-- only because all of it burned down.

349
00:14:32,403 --> 00:14:32,793
Right.

350
00:14:33,203 --> 00:14:35,913
So, picking on kids games isn't even fair.

351
00:14:35,922 --> 00:14:39,752
I would pick on all mobile games, mobile games are not games,

352
00:14:39,932 --> 00:14:43,353
mobile games are attention traps

353
00:14:43,603 --> 00:14:47,445
that want to try to convert your attention into ad revenue.

354
00:14:47,455 --> 00:14:48,185
Well, or,

355
00:14:48,195 --> 00:14:50,515
or you buy coins to make the game go faster

356
00:14:50,526 --> 00:14:53,286
because they intentionally make the game grinding and painful.

357
00:14:53,296 --> 00:14:56,026
My suspicion is most people don't do that.

358
00:14:56,036 --> 00:14:59,685
Most people probably end up watching stupid ads because you can usually like,

359
00:14:59,695 --> 00:15:03,466
watch an ad for free coins or whatever the garbage is that they're doing.

360
00:15:03,476 --> 00:15:07,306
I mean, this is, this is one of the terrifying things about

361
00:15:07,786 --> 00:15:12,466
kind of how modern society has constructed itself and from like, from,

362
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:14,585
from my perspective of security,

363
00:15:15,229 --> 00:15:17,159
I often wonder,

364
00:15:17,289 --> 00:15:19,119
where does this end?

365
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,969
Well, it doesn't like, it's the, the logical end is blip

366
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,340
Verts with people exploding.

367
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,000
-- That's the logical end point to all this.
-- That's from Max Hedger

368
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:32,440
-- for you young people.
-- Yeah, we'll include a clip

369
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:33,760
but like straight up,

370
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:37,599
like until we get to people exploding in their living rooms because of Blip Forts,

371
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,140
it's just going to keep escalating.

372
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:39,979
I mean,

373
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,130
it, it might be,

374
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,070
it might.

375
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:44,599
Yeah, I know.

376
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:48,539
But, but at the same time, right. So, so let's, let's focus on the ants.

377
00:15:49,109 --> 00:15:52,609
Advertising ad networks are well known for being

378
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,440
taken over by adversaries and distributing malware.

379
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:55,690
Yeah,

380
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,289
that's why I block them. It's,

381
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:00,559
you know between the the noise on the web page, the speed of loading it

382
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,929
and just the general. Well, this is how modern web browsers get hacked.

383
00:16:05,349 --> 00:16:08,789
I mean, what's also fascinating to me is is back to my fear of

384
00:16:09,049 --> 00:16:11,020
we need people to create content.

385
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,280
Now,

386
00:16:11,289 --> 00:16:12,729
I have no fear that there will be people

387
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:16,309
creating content because we like stone age cave paintings,

388
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,919
people people make stuff.

389
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,010
But my concern is we also need people to

390
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,690
kind of make boring stuff like investigative reporting,

391
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,729
you know, the Panama papers, things like that. Like

392
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:27,130
there are certain things that are let's face it.

393
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,969
Not like like painting a picture of your favorite sunset.

394
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:30,380
Yeah,

395
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:32,219
like there will be no shortage of that.

396
00:16:32,229 --> 00:16:35,119
Like people who want to be Bob Ross, no problem.

397
00:16:35,219 --> 00:16:38,609
But people who want to, you know, go expose government corruption and write,

398
00:16:38,619 --> 00:16:38,940
you know,

399
00:16:39,109 --> 00:16:41,219
20 to 100 page

400
00:16:41,429 --> 00:16:43,909
things about it that are, you know, well written in depth and

401
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,299
analyzed and

402
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,789
you know, fully sourced. Yeah, that

403
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,359
-- you can have to pay people to do that.
-- It's very difficult.

404
00:16:51,369 --> 00:16:53,599
I mean, look, I'm going to pick on us here, right?

405
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:57,479
We have a podcast, we make $0 on our podcast.

406
00:16:57,489 --> 00:16:59,440
So obviously we're not doing it for the money.

407
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:03,969
We are not insanely popular. So we're obviously not doing it for the fame.

408
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,760
It's something we basically enjoy doing. And so we do it

409
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:08,880
and

410
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,479
it's, I mean, I'm not gonna lie to you.

411
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:13,579
It's a convenient excuse to talk to you for at least an hour a week, which I,

412
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:14,439
which I love.

413
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:15,180
But like,

414
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,699
you know what I mean? It, it's,

415
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,598
if, if we were a monetized podcast,

416
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:22,400
it would change everything,

417
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,709
the dynamic would be different. Actually. It's funny.

418
00:17:24,719 --> 00:17:28,560
I got, I got an email the other day from someone saying, oh, do you need an editor?

419
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:31,319
I'm like, well, I have no budget. So no.

420
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,280
What were they offering for free?

421
00:17:33,572 --> 00:17:38,402
I did not ask, I would never do that to a person because I feel that's insulting.

422
00:17:38,412 --> 00:17:41,963
-- But it would be funny to say
-- like somebody might want to edit our podcast to get it on,

423
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:44,312
you know, to get the exposure so they can get a better job.

424
00:17:44,322 --> 00:17:47,353
-- But I'm pretty sure you can't buy food with exposure.
-- No, actually.

425
00:17:47,363 --> 00:17:50,762
So I'm, I'm extremely anti exposure. I think I would agree.

426
00:17:50,772 --> 00:17:52,812
Anyone who says, oh, do it for exposure.

427
00:17:52,932 --> 00:17:57,603
-- No, that's just a way to try to trick people
-- unless you're a performance artist.

428
00:17:57,692 --> 00:17:58,392
And there's like

429
00:17:58,505 --> 00:18:01,135
seven of them who make a living doing this on the plane,

430
00:18:01,526 --> 00:18:05,875
-- man. I, I'm anti exposure. I, I I'm not just, I
-- mean, I know.

431
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:08,536
No, I'm basically what I'm saying is I'm, I'm agreeing but there's like

432
00:18:08,715 --> 00:18:09,176
the counter

433
00:18:09,286 --> 00:18:10,796
argument of people can do this for a living.

434
00:18:12,145 --> 00:18:14,515
See, you do this all the time. This drives you crazy.

435
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:17,365
You're like, oh, here's this obscure corner case. I'm going to bring up.

436
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,105
But no, that doesn't legitimize the moment.

437
00:18:19,395 --> 00:18:19,426
But

438
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:19,745
my

439
00:18:19,885 --> 00:18:20,156
point is,

440
00:18:20,355 --> 00:18:21,645
that's exactly my point.

441
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,495
Like, there's only one bank seat.

442
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,420
-- There, there is. Well, he makes a fortune man. That guy, like, he's got it
-- made

443
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,219
and the rest of us are going to starve exposure is not going to buy us any ramen.

444
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,619
-- Right. That's right. That's right.
-- Well, I mean, that's the thing.

445
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:37,910
Like, how, how do we monetize, you know, the, the listeners we have, well,

446
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,250
advertising the answer or,

447
00:18:39,489 --> 00:18:43,239
you know, the more nebulous forms of advertising, like, oh, a show sponsor or,

448
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,209
you know, brought to you by Dr

449
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,489
-- mcginty's, you know, firewall rub
-- advertising. That's still.

450
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,030
Exactly. Exactly.

451
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,930
-- So,
-- there's Patreon,

452
00:18:50,969 --> 00:18:52,250
I was about to say, like,

453
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,380
the thought of getting somebody to pay for this.

454
00:18:55,189 --> 00:18:55,300
Yeah,

455
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:57,229
jokes on you sucker.

456
00:18:59,439 --> 00:18:59,500
Uh,

457
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,310
but,

458
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:05,000
and honestly, that's not an environment I even want

459
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,589
anyway. It's like if you have money to give to someone,

460
00:19:08,949 --> 00:19:11,510
please give it to a charity, don't give it to me.

461
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,449
Like I'm going to spend it on probably booze where

462
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:18,310
a charity might actually do something useful with it.

463
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:19,709
Right. Right.

464
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,949
Exactly. Exactly. But it, it is,

465
00:19:22,199 --> 00:19:22,989
again,

466
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:29,349
we bring ourselves back to this whole attention that this problem of attention.

467
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,729
Right. And, and that's kind of how you want to frame it and,

468
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:35,390
and obviously I always try to put my security hat on when I'm,

469
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,670
when I'm framing all of these discussions and thinking about

470
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,030
what does this mean and what doesn't it mean?

471
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,670
And everything? And I feel like

472
00:19:41,709 --> 00:19:46,280
in any security situation, what you end up there, there's kind of two aspects.

473
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,390
Right? There's the, we'll say wholesome troublemakers

474
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,219
which,

475
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:53,369
which those exist, I think less than they used to.

476
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,569
And then there's like the legitimate criminals. Right.

477
00:19:55,859 --> 00:19:58,489
And I feel like the attention economy today

478
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:59,469
is

479
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:04,219
you've got the legitimate businesses and you have some wholesome troublemakers

480
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:08,550
and I don't think like legitimate crime has figured this out yet,

481
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,849
but attention is becoming

482
00:20:11,239 --> 00:20:12,729
a valuable resource

483
00:20:12,949 --> 00:20:14,250
in the modern world.

484
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,770
What is going to happen when criminals decide it's time for us to get in on this.

485
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,890
Well, I mean, there was already some of this,

486
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,689
if you want to see some really deeply disturbing weird stuff, go

487
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,550
search for Elsa gate,

488
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,930
Els a gate

489
00:20:27,739 --> 00:20:29,859
and that like, I'm not even going to describe it.

490
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,329
It's just so messed up.

491
00:20:31,469 --> 00:20:34,489
And I, like my fear is we see stuff like that.

492
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,500
Like, I've already caught my kids watching videos where, like,

493
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,890
I'm paying attention to what's being said and I'm like, whoa,

494
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,609
like I thought this was just a video of somebody playing with a toy,

495
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:44,290
but like some of the stuff they're talking about is

496
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,930
that's not really appropriate for kids. And I'm like, is this

497
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:50,180
like, what is, I just don't understand what's going on?

498
00:20:50,189 --> 00:20:50,339
Like,

499
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,609
I don't think it's criminal but it's definitely not what I want my kids watching.

500
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:58,410
Right. Yeah. No, I do. I, I think this is one of the biggest arguments for

501
00:20:58,709 --> 00:21:02,329
having augmented reality to block out advertising because, I mean,

502
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,949
one reason I would love to visit Hawaii is apparently Hawaii doesn't allow those,

503
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:08,810
like, large signs by roads or anywhere.

504
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:09,640
Yeah,

505
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:13,589
-- because they're hideous and nobody wants to look at them like
-- they just

506
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,410
installed a couple new ones on a major road near my house and

507
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,520
they're just so big and ugly.

508
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:19,060
Yep.

509
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:23,560
Yeah. Right. Right. But they make someone money so they're going to do it.

510
00:21:24,069 --> 00:21:26,520
But, um, I, yeah, I, I feel like

511
00:21:26,739 --> 00:21:30,160
the way that criminals are going to weaponize and

512
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:35,430
subvert attention is going to be messy because I just,

513
00:21:35,439 --> 00:21:38,699
I can't imagine them finding some clean and clear way to monetize

514
00:21:38,709 --> 00:21:41,819
it because the legitimate people haven't and they've been trying for,

515
00:21:41,829 --> 00:21:43,150
you know, a good 100 years.

516
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:48,589
-- I mean,
-- so, actually, do you know of an instance where bad people have used

517
00:21:49,069 --> 00:21:51,420
advertising to their advantage?

518
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:55,660
Well, sort of the whole, well, ignoring, like, drive by downloads,

519
00:21:55,670 --> 00:22:00,739
the whole sort of getting whipping up public outrage to, you know,

520
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,819
target a person or a group of people

521
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:03,849
has happened.

522
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:06,699
And so a great example, there would be, you know, the Russian

523
00:22:07,229 --> 00:22:09,040
and Chinese online,

524
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:12,790
you know, trolling stuff, getting various other groups of people to do dumb things.

525
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,250
Like, well, I'm not even sure I want to say it because then we'll get, like,

526
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,329
beaten up on Twitter.

527
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:17,819
I think we can all agree that, you know,

528
00:22:17,829 --> 00:22:19,949
there's a bunch of stuff that's happened online where people have

529
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:22,739
been whipped up into a frenzy to do really dumb things.

530
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:26,890
-- I
-- mean, that's not new by any means. I think online makes it easier.

531
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,770
But there have been state level disinformation campaign

532
00:22:30,295 --> 00:22:32,155
as long as there have been states

533
00:22:32,454 --> 00:22:33,625
propaganda, I mean.

534
00:22:33,974 --> 00:22:35,974
Right. Right. Exactly. It works.

535
00:22:36,114 --> 00:22:40,545
And, and I mean, let's, let's ignore that particular instance, even like, what are,

536
00:22:40,555 --> 00:22:41,265
I can think, you know,

537
00:22:41,275 --> 00:22:43,604
there have been some scams throughout history

538
00:22:43,614 --> 00:22:46,744
where like the pyramid scams are obviously

539
00:22:46,755 --> 00:22:52,344
an easy one where someone convinced someone else to invest in their opportunity.

540
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:56,310
I mean, that's why we call them Ponzi schemes. There was a guy literally named Ponzi

541
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,869
who came up with them

542
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,790
and, and so there's some of that,

543
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,319
but I feel like

544
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:07,550
there is never been a wide scale criminal aspect to advertising

545
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,989
through history. I think there have been one offs but it's never been

546
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:13,229
-- substantial.
-- I know bre

547
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,890
X that was a big gold scandal back in the day here in Canada.

548
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:21,050
And so basically it was a gold mine, I want to say in Indonesia

549
00:23:21,339 --> 00:23:25,449
where the geologist salted the samples and because he was a geologist,

550
00:23:25,459 --> 00:23:27,449
he salted them properly so that, you know, the,

551
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:31,270
the results came back very promising, but not like, oh my God, it's just full of gold,

552
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,650
right?

553
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:35,290
$6 billion blah, blah,

554
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,750
blah, blah, blah, blah, massive fraud.

555
00:23:37,939 --> 00:23:39,839
Brix collapsed, blah, blah, blah.

556
00:23:40,209 --> 00:23:41,910
Yeah, there was like no gold there.

557
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,910
-- Well,
-- so this is interesting actually is if you conduct fraud on that level,

558
00:23:47,189 --> 00:23:49,449
you're almost definitely going to get caught

559
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:52,709
-- and you're probably going to face repercussions.
-- Yes.

560
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:52,939
And no,

561
00:23:52,949 --> 00:23:55,810
if you get enough money and go to a country that's not very

562
00:23:55,819 --> 00:23:58,469
nice and doesn't extradite to other countries and you're willing to live there

563
00:23:58,614 --> 00:24:00,244
a pile of money. I mean, but that's pretty rare.

564
00:24:00,255 --> 00:24:04,104
-- Again, criminals don't do this, they get caught.
-- It, it depends who you rip off.

565
00:24:04,114 --> 00:24:04,555
I mean,

566
00:24:04,765 --> 00:24:07,035
you're going to accidentally fall out of a window.

567
00:24:07,165 --> 00:24:11,805
Right. If you, if you ripped off the wrong person is how those tend to work.

568
00:24:11,814 --> 00:24:13,484
But when you, when you think about online, I mean,

569
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:16,834
let's consider it in the context of the Twitter story

570
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:17,880
where

571
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:21,239
it was, I mean, basically it was weaponized. Advertising

572
00:24:21,369 --> 00:24:23,119
is the way I would think of it

573
00:24:23,449 --> 00:24:23,959
and,

574
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:25,800
well, more weaponized attention.

575
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,920
-- Yeah.
-- I mean, same idea. Really? Right.

576
00:24:28,089 --> 00:24:29,800
Well, you know, it reminds me of the classic thing,

577
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:32,040
like all these business plans that consist of we will,

578
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:34,449
you get 100% of everybody on the planet to spend 10

579
00:24:34,459 --> 00:24:36,459
cents with us and that's why you need to invest,

580
00:24:36,469 --> 00:24:38,239
you know, $6 million in our seed round.

581
00:24:38,739 --> 00:24:38,969
Right.

582
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:41,680
Yeah, that is technically true, but

583
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:42,819
it's not going to happen.

584
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:43,739
Right.

585
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:46,060
Yes. Exactly. Exactly.

586
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,020
So,

587
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,520
anyway, anyway, So here's

588
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,099
my prediction

589
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:55,229
of what this is going to look like with things like A I

590
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,339
and

591
00:24:56,609 --> 00:25:02,430
things like our attention economy. And so there is any time there's an incentive

592
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,239
you're going to have,

593
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:08,189
I would, I would say there's a spectrum from people with good intent,

594
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:09,609
people with ill intent.

595
00:25:09,619 --> 00:25:11,229
And then there's a lot of things in the middle.

596
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:14,750
And I would argue, like, for example, social media is probably in the middle,

597
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,390
leaning toward ill intent where I think a number of these companies know

598
00:25:18,739 --> 00:25:21,660
that they're, they're, they're selling us drugs

599
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,569
and they know it, but they don't care because they're,

600
00:25:24,579 --> 00:25:26,199
they're rolling in piles of money

601
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:28,859
and that obviously changes people's perspective, but

602
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:34,400
there is money in this and I think it is a matter of time before criminals invest in it.

603
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:36,280
And I have no doubt anyone listening,

604
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:38,560
there are probably examples of this you might know about.

605
00:25:38,569 --> 00:25:39,140
I don't

606
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,599
let us know.

607
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:46,199
I would love to explore this further because I feel like in this space, we often

608
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:46,619
assume,

609
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:50,290
I assume, I, I think if we, if we view it as like a number line, right,

610
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,439
where good guys are on the left, bad guys are on the right.

611
00:25:52,449 --> 00:25:57,449
I think we assume it's farther to the left than it really is in terms of the content.

612
00:25:57,459 --> 00:25:58,109
You know what I mean?

613
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,689
-- Well, I mean,
-- we know about ad fraud where they, you know, they click ads to get money,

614
00:26:01,699 --> 00:26:02,040
right.

615
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:05,479
And that, that's pretty self explanatory. You know, you run a site that

616
00:26:05,609 --> 00:26:09,010
generates clicks, you get money. So we run a site that generates clicks.

617
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,689
But as far as actually

618
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:14,680
kind of going that next step to, you know, how do I basically get,

619
00:26:14,989 --> 00:26:18,969
assuming I have Kurt's attention for 30 seconds. How do I turn that into some money?

620
00:26:18,979 --> 00:26:22,420
Yeah, that's, that's a tricky one because I'm not into microtransaction.

621
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:25,760
So, good luck getting any money out of me. I actually, you know what? That's not true.

622
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,209
I did get ripped off online.

623
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:29,589
There was this thing that was supposed to be like this fun drawing board thing.

624
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:33,425
So I ordered it and it was a complete piece of garbage that was like, worth, you know,

625
00:26:33,435 --> 00:26:35,755
$2 as it turns out and didn't work.

626
00:26:35,765 --> 00:26:38,555
But of course, it was, you know, cheap enough that I'm not going to, like, you know,

627
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:40,125
send it back to China and try and get my

628
00:26:40,135 --> 00:26:42,194
money back and it was bought through some rather,

629
00:26:42,204 --> 00:26:43,305
you know, dodgy site.

630
00:26:43,314 --> 00:26:46,354
Like, no, it wasn't ebay or, you know, Amazon. It was like some,

631
00:26:46,824 --> 00:26:48,275
not even like Alibaba thing.

632
00:26:48,699 --> 00:26:51,780
And so, you know, my lesson learned there is now II,

633
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:55,719
I tend to stick to ebay and Amazon and some other major sites where

634
00:26:55,729 --> 00:26:57,800
I know that I can actually get my money back if you know,

635
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:59,400
somebody sends me a brick in the mail.

636
00:26:59,969 --> 00:27:00,290
Yeah. Yeah,

637
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:00,959
I mean,

638
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:01,260
I,

639
00:27:02,109 --> 00:27:04,670
II, I can totally relate to that.

640
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,589
-- Yeah.
-- So, but,

641
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:07,260
but, I mean, beyond like,

642
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:10,969
sort of those, those, all those things, like what the new forms of crime will be.

643
00:27:10,979 --> 00:27:11,510
Yeah. I don't know.

644
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,770
And, and if you do know of them and are willing to share, please let us know it.

645
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:18,329
I'd be fascinated to find out about this because I have no doubt.

646
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:18,819
Or, you know,

647
00:27:18,829 --> 00:27:20,520
maybe there's already things happening that you and

648
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,209
I participated in and we don't even realize,

649
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:25,560
oh, I have no doubt. I, I absolutely have no doubt. And

650
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:31,079
I, I don't know, I think it'll be interesting to see where this all goes because

651
00:27:31,329 --> 00:27:35,000
attention is becoming valuable, more valuable,

652
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,599
especially now we're all stuck at home.

653
00:27:36,609 --> 00:27:37,349
Right. I mean, I

654
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:38,459
think

655
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,750
it is becoming more apparent

656
00:27:41,069 --> 00:27:46,650
that there is value in getting people to pay attention to you and what you're doing

657
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,400
and how you get them. There

658
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,329
is

659
00:27:49,569 --> 00:27:52,290
-- going to be an interesting ride for
-- sure.

660
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:56,130
Well, I mean, unless it's literally flouted legal or causing people to explode,

661
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,140
companies will probably do it let alone criminals.

662
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:02,489
Well, in part of what you said as well at the beginning is good criminals,

663
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,739
smart criminals.

664
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,989
They do things that aren't illegal yet.

665
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:09,719
And so there's going to be activity that is

666
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:13,270
happening now with social media and grabbing your attention

667
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,520
that is going to become illegal someday.

668
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,359
Right. Exactly.

669
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:20,680
Assuming they don't make enough money doing it to just make it legal.

670
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,300
Well, not really? Right. Like, I mean,

671
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:28,099
that's what always blows me about tobacco. Is that again? Classic?

672
00:28:28,109 --> 00:28:30,089
You know, they paid a fine but admitted no wrongdoing.

673
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:33,880
You know, the tobacco industry paid a fine of hundreds of billions of dollars.

674
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:34,619
And last I checked,

675
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,170
you can still buy a pack of cigarettes here in Canada and the US and, well,

676
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,459
most of the world for that matter.

677
00:28:38,949 --> 00:28:40,300
I mean, well, this is, I mean,

678
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:43,819
this is an argument you can make about countless controlled substances, right?

679
00:28:43,829 --> 00:28:47,030
I mean, alcohol is problematic. Tobacco is problematic.

680
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:47,920
There's,

681
00:28:48,219 --> 00:28:51,089
I, I'm, I don't want to dwell on this, but actually I,

682
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:55,939
I like to point at Portugal where Portugal was having a substantial drug problem

683
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,750
and they just made everything legal and the problem kind of went away

684
00:28:59,219 --> 00:29:01,319
-- and did they legalize
-- it or decriminalize

685
00:29:01,329 --> 00:29:03,060
it? I don't know which day.

686
00:29:03,069 --> 00:29:06,520
-- I think that's a good question.
-- They decriminalized it. They did not legalize it.

687
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:09,439
So there's a subtle difference that I, I'm, I'm not qualified to explain.

688
00:29:09,869 --> 00:29:13,089
But I know in Canada, for example, we legalized marijuana,

689
00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:15,959
like when you buy marijuana now it has a federal tax stamp on it.

690
00:29:16,699 --> 00:29:20,430
Like it comes in a package with, well, like a cigarette with a tax stamp on it and,

691
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:21,329
you know,

692
00:29:21,339 --> 00:29:24,790
you go to the Alberta Gaming Liquor Commission website

693
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,130
if you want to buy the stuff online.

694
00:29:26,699 --> 00:29:27,880
And, and so, I mean,

695
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:32,699
using this argument as well and we'll try to tie it all together is so,

696
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,449
I mean, you could argue that

697
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:38,930
looking at crap memes on Reddit all day is bad for people.

698
00:29:38,939 --> 00:29:42,000
-- And it probably is,
-- I think the challenge is, it's like junk food,

699
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,000
junk food once in a while.

700
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:45,589
Fine. But if all you eat is junk food, you end up.

701
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:45,750
Well,

702
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,680
there was a report yesterday about the US where something like 25% of

703
00:29:48,689 --> 00:29:51,760
young people can't qualify for the military because they're so out of shape.

704
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:56,079
And that in general, this, this terrible diet in the US, for them, like a lot,

705
00:29:56,089 --> 00:29:58,329
a vast majority of people is becoming such a problem.

706
00:29:58,339 --> 00:30:02,300
It's, it's feeding the health care issues. It's like it's causing real problems

707
00:30:02,689 --> 00:30:06,550
and, you know, if you eat a Big Mac once a week, sure. But if you eat a Big Mac every day

708
00:30:06,699 --> 00:30:07,739
for every meal,

709
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,349
well, you remember, yeah, the, the super size me guy where his doctors,

710
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:13,560
like your liver is turning into pate,

711
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,099
you know?

712
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,359
And I mean,

713
00:30:16,569 --> 00:30:19,790
this is, this is difficult, right? Is, how do you, how do you draw the lines?

714
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,280
How do you say what's good or bad?

715
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:22,280
And

716
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:25,660
you're, you're right. If all I do is read Reddit all day, every day.

717
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:29,739
If all I do is read Facebook all day, every day, that is clearly bad for me.

718
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,199
If I read it sometimes,

719
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:35,680
-- maybe you could argue. It's not bad for me either.
-- Either adults have

720
00:30:35,859 --> 00:30:39,810
agency and are allowed to kind of do what they want within, you know, some limits,

721
00:30:39,819 --> 00:30:42,219
like you're not allowed to run red lights, we frown upon that.

722
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,400
But

723
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,579
generally speaking,

724
00:30:44,589 --> 00:30:46,920
either adults have agency and get to make choices and

725
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:50,060
live with the consequences of those choices or they don't.

726
00:30:50,069 --> 00:30:52,680
And there are some corner cases where we've outlawed some

727
00:30:52,689 --> 00:30:55,140
things and behaviors because they just are so terrible.

728
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:57,300
We are, we are out of time.

729
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,479
But I want to,

730
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:02,444
I want to end on this thought and we could maybe pick this up at a future date is

731
00:31:02,574 --> 00:31:06,574
I agree with you that saying adults have the ability to make choices

732
00:31:06,704 --> 00:31:07,344
is

733
00:31:07,515 --> 00:31:08,844
a valid argument.

734
00:31:08,984 --> 00:31:14,165
But I would, I would counter that with in the world of, of social media and attention

735
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:19,359
things are being done to us to subvert our ability to choose.

736
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,079
And that is difficult.

737
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,760
Well, just like engineered foodstuffs that trick our tongue.

738
00:31:23,969 --> 00:31:25,119
Very similar. Yes.

739
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:25,930
And there are,

740
00:31:25,939 --> 00:31:27,560
there are always going to be people who have the

741
00:31:27,569 --> 00:31:30,479
ability to step back and say this is not ok.

742
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:32,500
I don't like what's happening here and there's

743
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,380
all there's going to be another group of people

744
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,479
that it is, it is like a sickness to them that they cannot escape.

745
00:31:38,819 --> 00:31:42,020
And this is true of drug addiction. It's true of food addiction.

746
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,880
It's, it's pick a thing

747
00:31:44,329 --> 00:31:46,569
and there's always going to be a subset of people like that.

748
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:49,969
But in the case of attention economies,

749
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,349
they are weaponizing these behaviors in people for their own benefit,

750
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:56,930
which is horrifying.

751
00:31:57,209 --> 00:31:57,459
Well,

752
00:31:57,469 --> 00:32:00,239
and what's amusing is there are browser extensions or DNS services

753
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:03,229
that literally have profiles to like block you from accessing social

754
00:32:03,334 --> 00:32:05,444
-- media while you're trying to get your work done.
-- Oh, cool.

755
00:32:05,645 --> 00:32:06,285
Nice. All right.

756
00:32:06,295 --> 00:32:09,834
Anyway, I'm going to call this because this is a weird meta episode band.

757
00:32:09,964 --> 00:32:10,535
I love it.

758
00:32:10,545 --> 00:32:12,224
I guess the moral of the story is stop

759
00:32:12,234 --> 00:32:14,155
wasting your time and go do something productive.

760
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:15,775
Instead of listening to this podcast.

761
00:32:15,925 --> 00:32:18,525
-- Wait,
-- no, they should listen to more podcasts. Well,

762
00:32:18,755 --> 00:32:22,305
that we can win the internet, help us win the internet everyone. That's what we need,

763
00:32:22,994 --> 00:32:25,305
right? Like what is it like and subscribe?

764
00:32:25,974 --> 00:32:26,135
Oh, yeah.

00:32:26,265 --> 00:32:27,344
Hit that like and subscribe button,

766
00:32:30,089 --> 00:32:34,410

so.

770
