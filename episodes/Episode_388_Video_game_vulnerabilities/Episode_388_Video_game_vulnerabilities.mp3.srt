Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:13,050
Kurt Siefried and my partner in enjoying surprise topics, Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,260
I hate surprises so much. So you're going to like this one.

3
00:00:16,389 --> 00:00:17,700
That's what you keep saying.

4
00:00:17,709 --> 00:00:19,860
So I generally talk Kurt out of this,

5
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:23,059
but he won't crack this time and he says it has something to do with

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,469
video games. And I really like,

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,639
-- ok,
-- I love video games. So I'm gonna let this one go.

8
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:32,849
But generally speaking, I would have browbeat Kurt into not surprising me. So

9
00:00:33,029 --> 00:00:33,740
let's go.

10
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:35,090
So it's basically,

11
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:36,950
there's, there's two parts to this.

12
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:41,020
The first part is the classic. When does a bug become a vulnerability?

13
00:00:41,389 --> 00:00:42,659
And the second part is

14
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:45,880
the heist. So, and, and it's two different games.

15
00:00:45,889 --> 00:00:49,200
Very popular games though, Starcraft two and Minecraft the heist.

16
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:50,060
I don't know that.

17
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:53,400
-- No, it's not. I'm talking about like a bank heist in
-- Minecraft,

18
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:54,169
a

19
00:00:54,349 --> 00:00:55,000
bank

20
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:55,450
heist in

21
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:56,529
-- Minecraft
-- basically. Yeah.

22
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,669
So the first bug is ok. So Starcraft two, let's give a little back history.

23
00:01:01,169 --> 00:01:04,050
Starcraft two. Aficionado. So you tell us,

24
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:06,470
I watch quite a bit of it online like I

25
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:07,559
anyway.

26
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:10,949
Oh, hey, good. News, Nova War and Maxima's back are black.

27
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,120
Uh They're back, they, they, they took like an eight year hiatus and they're,

28
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:15,680
they're now back in casting.

29
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,190
So shout out to them. They're doing great content. We should put a link to them.

30
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,779
I have no idea who that is. But,

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,589
but OK,

32
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,089
they talk about mac and cheese

33
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,470
anyway. So uh pig who's an Australian caster? Streamer? That

34
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:31,010
person? I've heard of. OK. See, so he was talking about the Colossus Range bug. So

35
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,739
Starcraft Two right now is kind of on life support.

36
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,730
Like Blizzard isn't putting a lot of effort into it because to put it bluntly,

37
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:41,750
they've sold 99.6 percent of the copies of the game they're ever going to sell.

38
00:01:41,949 --> 00:01:42,660
Probably,

39
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:43,220
right.

40
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,269
So thanks that they're still running the servers

41
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:48,019
and they're still sort of pushing out new maps

42
00:01:48,029 --> 00:01:49,910
and balance patches because this is my favorite

43
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:51,860
thing about Starcraft two is at any point,

44
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:55,089
the game is inherently unfair and unbalanced,

45
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,150
but it's

46
00:01:56,309 --> 00:01:59,940
overall unbalanced and unfair enough to everybody that

47
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:02,389
it kind of works between the three races.

48
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,260
That's kind of how these games work.

49
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:08,440
But there's always like a map with a spot for a siege tank that like, oh dang it,

50
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:10,660
you know, like you just, it's a, you know, instant win

51
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,119
kind of thing. So

52
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,220
they pushed out an update to Starcraft and there's a bug in it

53
00:02:15,429 --> 00:02:17,369
and it's the colossus that Protos

54
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,360
unit that has like the little laser beam lawn mower thing.

55
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,669
It's got a range bug.

56
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:25,309
So instead of when you upgrade it, it adds one to the range, it adds three to the range.

57
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:25,479
And

58
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:27,220
as you can imagine,

59
00:02:27,779 --> 00:02:29,240
plus three range

60
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:33,639
-- is not balanced at all.
-- Is it, is it game breaking?

61
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:33,669
Oh,

62
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:38,080
-- absolutely.
-- Have the patcher fixed it for Blizzard.

63
00:02:38,169 --> 00:02:39,610
The mod community has

64
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:44,360
and tournaments are running with mods by and large to undo this bug

65
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:46,279
because basically what happened is they,

66
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:48,119
they bundled up a bunch of files for an

67
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,789
update and something slipped in that shouldn't have.

68
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,919
So my question to you is, is this a security vulnerability?

69
00:02:53,929 --> 00:02:57,639
-- I'm inclined
-- and I'll remind you there's money on the line because tournaments,

70
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:58,880
well, that's just it.

71
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:04,119
I'm inclined to say no, I feel like a, a bug in a game of this nature

72
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,160
feels like not a security vulnerability.

73
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:13,080
And I would also lean in the direction of this is like expected use.

74
00:03:13,089 --> 00:03:16,000
You're not doing anything sneaky to exploit this.

75
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:18,729
You're just, it's literally how the game works.

76
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,110
However, in, in what you mentioned, there's money on the line,

77
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:25,509
there's real money in video games now and

78
00:03:25,869 --> 00:03:28,110
a bug like this gives someone

79
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,389
a substantial advantage.

80
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:36,080
So I would argue, maybe not exactly a security vulnerability,

81
00:03:36,089 --> 00:03:40,940
but it's definitely on the line of this needs to be dealt with because it is,

82
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,800
it is significant. It's kind of like the example I'll use when I worked at elastic.

83
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:49,229
Obviously, we dealt with security vulnerabilities all the time,

84
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,369
but we also had data corruption bugs, things where

85
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,350
nothing a user couldn't trigger it.

86
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,990
But like just through a series of events,

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,639
you could corrupt data and data corruption,

88
00:03:59,649 --> 00:04:02,699
bugs were treated even more seriously than security vulnerabilities

89
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:04,529
because they are more serious.

90
00:04:04,779 --> 00:04:08,229
And I think this is kind of the same thing where when you have a game

91
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,179
that

92
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:13,860
is especially used by professionals, any sort of bug

93
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:17,369
that gives one group an advantage over another.

94
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:22,839
I maybe not a security vulnerability technically, but it is in the same

95
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:27,239
-- level of we have to do something about this.
-- See, for me, it ticks a few boxes.

96
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,000
Number one, is it a problem? Let's not even talk about Attackers yet.

97
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:34,000
But is this bug a significant problem?

98
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,820
Like, remember when manage,

99
00:04:35,829 --> 00:04:41,149
uh when we uh they shipped an update to um manage iqevm and had a like a classic memory,

100
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,670
free memory leak

101
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,559
where it basically didn't free memory.

102
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,760
And so like it would run for a day and a half and then,

103
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,320
right, like, because it just ran out of memory and, and

104
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:53,429
I, I remember because I was talking to them, they,

105
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,850
they were supposed to be also fixing some security bug and they're like,

106
00:04:56,269 --> 00:04:59,390
they told me why they were late on this moderate security flaw.

107
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:04,369
And I'm like, oh yeah, no, go fix that first. Like, I don't care about my moderate bug.

108
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,980
You have to fix that right now. Tell me when you fixed it and, like, get back to me

109
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,100
because

110
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,290
we can't have that for customers. Right.

111
00:05:13,299 --> 00:05:16,809
Like that's, that's worse than any security because it's inevitable. It's, it's

112
00:05:17,309 --> 00:05:21,700
anyways. So I would say first of all, it ticks that box of. Is this a problem? Yes.

113
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:24,299
Number two can an attacker actively exploit it?

114
00:05:24,309 --> 00:05:26,230
Like your data corruption bug is a good example of, well,

115
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:28,690
the attacker can't intentionally trigger it,

116
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,609
but as the defender,

117
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:30,890
I

118
00:05:31,059 --> 00:05:33,690
don't really care if my data is corrupt, my data is corrupt.

119
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,489
That's a problem for me, for sure. Right.

120
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,929
Right. Regardless of why it happens, it's a problem.

121
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:43,089
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And, and personally I think security bugs need to be

122
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:47,269
spread out a bit to encompass not just what Attackers can trigger,

123
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,510
but regardless.

124
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,279
So, but this one,

125
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,029
an attacker obviously can trigger by choosing

126
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,609
a build that involves building colossus,

127
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:52,739
right?

128
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,190
Because you could do like a, a three robot

129
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,350
with, you know,

130
00:05:55,619 --> 00:05:57,429
immortal sent drops or whatever

131
00:05:57,559 --> 00:06:01,269
and, and ignore colossus. No, my point is you don't have to use this.

132
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,850
Like there's a lot of players that don't use certain

133
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,549
elements of the game.

134
00:06:05,809 --> 00:06:06,570
OK. Right.

135
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:09,829
There's players that play Bio, they don't play Mac or they play Mac and not Bo,

136
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:10,790
right? So

137
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,230
the can an attacker exploit this in the sense of like they can choose to use

138
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:17,220
classes and they can choose to do the range upgrade and get that plus three.

139
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,899
Sweet, sweet game breaking. Goodness. No.

140
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:23,269
So the videos of this thing happening, like the clauses are like, just

141
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,859
like they're, they're like almost off screen mentally for me.

142
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm like, what, what are they doing there? And they're like zap, zap,

143
00:06:29,109 --> 00:06:31,429
zap. And I'm like, what the hell? Like I'm like that

144
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:33,760
you need to be, you, you can't do that.

145
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:36,690
Like you're, there's rocks in the way you can't, the, the range and then it's like,

146
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,260
oh, it's a bug.

147
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:37,739
Ok.

148
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,179
So it definitely can be exploited by Attackers.

149
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:45,140
And here's one thing that always, I personally found not as defining security bugs,

150
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:47,149
but really kind of pushing them over the edges.

151
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,100
Can it be fixed?

152
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,309
And the answer is yes, you can install a mod for tournaments or,

153
00:06:52,489 --> 00:06:55,359
you know, you could agree to play on modded, whatever and, and

154
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:56,660
make the bug go away.

155
00:06:56,989 --> 00:06:57,399
Right.

156
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,339
So it's not like some inherent design decision.

157
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,119
That's just like, oh, this is how the unit works. Too bad. No, it's like

158
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,890
you, you change this one number and it goes away basically. Right.

159
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:07,839
The problem goes away.

160
00:07:07,989 --> 00:07:09,329
-- Why
-- hasn't blizzard just

161
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:09,609
released

162
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:12,529
on life support? It's going to be a few weeks or months.

163
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:17,190
-- So they're going to fix it just when they fix it.
-- Well, I, I would hope so.

164
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,309
But more to the point like the mod community, there's mods that fix it, right.

165
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:24,040
I mean, there's mods for Starcraft that allow you to do

166
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:25,730
pretty much anything. So,

167
00:07:25,989 --> 00:07:26,410
so,

168
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,709
so we've now established that there can be bugs in video games that are

169
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,179
not traditional security vulnerabilities, but

170
00:07:34,429 --> 00:07:37,500
do look and smell a lot like security vulnerabilities and especially

171
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,140
there's often money on the line.

172
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,130
Uh Sure.

173
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:44,329
-- Which means now Attackers have incentive before
-- I technically correct you on this.

174
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:48,660
-- I want to see where this is going.
-- So that leads us to the Heist. So Minecraft.

175
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:52,980
So there's a bunch of big public Minecraft servers.

176
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:53,660
Like

177
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,850
-- when I say big, I mean, like 1000 concurrent players,
-- that's at least

178
00:07:58,029 --> 00:07:59,809
-- they're huge.
-- So

179
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,140
there's a really good video that was put out.

180
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,019
Actually, it's a year old now and it's about two B two Ts.

181
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,660
It's one of the biggest Minecraft

182
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,910
-- anarchy servers.
-- It's, it's fabulous.

183
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:13,850
I, I've logged in like twice and every time I basically died immediately.

184
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:14,920
And I'm like f this,

185
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:17,279
-- you
-- like my topic. You're smiling, this is

186
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:17,609
great.

187
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,160
I love video games, you know, this.

188
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,369
So basically there was

189
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,010
a,

190
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:24,220
a bug in the game

191
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,350
that could be used to track players in

192
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,089
if you exploited it properly in near real time.

193
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:31,739
OK.

194
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,590
And so what happened is

195
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,900
on Minecraft,

196
00:08:35,109 --> 00:08:35,849
you can

197
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:39,820
harvest resources and build items and harvest rare stuff like

198
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,419
end pearls and build really cool items like diamond armor,

199
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:44,179
enchanted swords, blah, blah, blah.

200
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:47,330
And obviously some people like us filthy casuals just want

201
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,539
to log it in and have a good time.

202
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,559
So maybe we're willing to spend 10 bucks on

203
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,530
a suit of diamond armor and some other stuff.

204
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:54,500
So we don't immediately instant die to

205
00:08:54,849 --> 00:08:55,859
the people who

206
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,960
-- are 14 years old.
-- Can, can you buy gear on two B, two T, I don't even know,

207
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:03,789
but you can buy gear anywhere because it happens outside the game.

208
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:08,469
-- I see. I see. Right.
-- I mean, we have a market for illegal drugs.

209
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:11,869
That's a lot harder to deliver that online craft sword

210
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:16,099
-- and maybe added to be two t like that place is brutal.
-- Well,

211
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:20,349
so there's an actual act of competition between the ST

212
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,440
the stores

213
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:26,250
and there was this one group that was grieving and blowing up all the stores.

214
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,030
And they're kind of like, well, how are they finding us?

215
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,289
And they basically did a bit of research.

216
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,330
They had, there were all these accounts that were logged in 24 7

217
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,750
and they were using this, uh this bug,

218
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,929
this exploit to track where everybody was going.

219
00:09:37,979 --> 00:09:40,260
And so the thing is kind of like cell phone metadata.

220
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:43,099
I, I know where you live now because you know, you,

221
00:09:43,109 --> 00:09:45,619
your phone spends eight hours a day not moving

222
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,450
from like midnight till late. So like that's where you live.

223
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,039
Right.

224
00:09:50,469 --> 00:09:52,140
And so they were able to use this bug to

225
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,150
find where all the stores were and go grief them.

226
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:56,679
Right? Because they try and keep the location of a lot of these stores hidden.

227
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,080
So, but they don't get grieved.

228
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:58,960
Exactly.

229
00:09:59,409 --> 00:10:03,739
So this group spent several months planning this

230
00:10:04,489 --> 00:10:07,349
and the idea basically was, is they were going to build

231
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,320
because they got grieved. And so they were gonna build the biggest store

232
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,340
and their operational security was insane.

233
00:10:13,349 --> 00:10:16,640
So for example, one of the rules was you can't walk, like you can't go to the,

234
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,950
to the place and come back like walking.

235
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,130
You, you have to teleport

236
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:22,750
using pearl except that's not secure enough.

237
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,840
So they used a bug in the uh under Pearl Teleports, which is if your,

238
00:10:27,849 --> 00:10:30,590
let's say your character name is Bob and you throw an

239
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,390
pearl,

240
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,219
ok over into an un rendered chunk,

241
00:10:34,849 --> 00:10:38,070
it stays and floats there until that chunk is rendered.

242
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:38,789
OK?

243
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,390
And the bug is the ender pearl.

244
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,570
The thing that teleports to it is whatever character has the name of who threw it.

245
00:10:45,789 --> 00:10:46,309
So

246
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:50,539
you your Us Bob, you throw a pearl to an un rendered chunk

247
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,919
and then you change your character name

248
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:57,039
to something else. And then on your second account, you change that one to Bob.

249
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01,270
Now this is not an instant thing. These name changes take a month or two to take place.

250
00:11:01,859 --> 00:11:03,960
So there's a degree of patience here. That is

251
00:11:04,849 --> 00:11:06,250
impressive. Seems

252
00:11:06,369 --> 00:11:10,340
bizarre. So basically they preloaded with dropping these

253
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,359
pearls so that they could teleport to them in future.

254
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,599
That was the first stage of their security. The second stage

255
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,679
was they had to get all the 24 7 accounts

256
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,390
to not be online.

257
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,650
And they found another bug in minecraft that

258
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:27,559
allowed them to basically denial the service the server

259
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,900
so that it started bumping users and it bumps the users who sent the

260
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:33,809
most data first and puts them in the queue to log back in.

261
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:36,309
And the accounts that have been in 24 7,

262
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:39,450
obviously, like they're the ones sending and receiving the most data.

263
00:11:39,549 --> 00:11:42,030
So basically, what they would do is they would doss the server.

264
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:44,890
It creates about aw it's straight up, creates like a 22nd gap.

265
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,640
So it's straight up like a heist film where it's like, OK, we do this,

266
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:51,150
we do this and the security system is off for 20 seconds and then we go into the vault,

267
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:51,890
right?

268
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,770
There'll be a link in the show notes to

269
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,580
the video that explains this in much more depth.

270
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,479
It's about a 13 minute video. It's

271
00:11:57,619 --> 00:12:00,479
-- awesome.
-- I can't wait to watch this. This sounds amazing.

272
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,049
So

273
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,809
they did all that.

274
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,989
They built this

275
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,599
man

276
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:08,340
and, and then here's the problem. How do you hide something this big?

277
00:12:08,349 --> 00:12:08,840
We're talking,

278
00:12:08,849 --> 00:12:11,349
it was like over 1000 double wide chests full

279
00:12:11,359 --> 00:12:14,400
of stuff full of Shulker boxes full of stuff.

280
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:14,909
So they

281
00:12:15,049 --> 00:12:15,679
built

282
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,210
a base that looked like it had been attacked and grieved.

283
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:21,840
-- Oh
-- Clever, clever hiding in plain sight.

284
00:12:22,169 --> 00:12:23,559
Basically masking,

285
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,729
right? Like ignore this rundown house. That smells funny.

286
00:12:26,739 --> 00:12:28,710
It's totally not a CIA hideout.

287
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,330
It's just full of boxes of guns in the basement

288
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:34,869
anyways, they did all this and of course,

289
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,049
then once they established this and got their store going,

290
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,380
if you have a store, what's the best way to drive traffic to your store?

291
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:42,059
I

292
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:43,750
mean, probably ads,

293
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,650
you burn down all the other stores.

294
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:45,960
I mean,

295
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,349
that is one way to do it.

296
00:12:48,469 --> 00:12:50,390
And in Minecraft on two B, two T

297
00:12:50,909 --> 00:12:54,380
-- that's, I mean, that seems like the easiest way I would
-- agree.

298
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,299
So they went around,

299
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:58,239
they used these bugs to find out where all the other stores

300
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,559
were and they went and blew them up and burned them down.

301
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:01,380
I mean,

302
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:05,059
that's just like classic, old school capitalism right there.

303
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,219
-- You know, like
-- I solved the,

304
00:13:06,349 --> 00:13:09,330
you know, like, hey, we're in competition with this other restaurant.

305
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,330
I boss, I solved the problem.

306
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,770
That's right.

307
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,979
They didn't pay their protection money.

308
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:15,940
Yeah. So,

309
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:21,659
and, and the thing is like they had about, it was $14,000 roughly worth of inventory,

310
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:25,979
you know? Which sounds, well, that is a lot.

311
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,179
But it's funny because in the grand scheme of things,

312
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,099
considering how many hours they put into this,

313
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,400
it's probably less than minimum wage.

314
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,340
I would think so. But,

315
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,619
wow.

316
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,820
So, and, and so here's a question,

317
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:41,349
should that be treated like a security incident or is it all?

318
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:44,140
Oh ha ha. People playing video games and, like, doing little bugs?

319
00:13:44,215 --> 00:13:49,184
I mean, I think that is definitely a security bug in that context

320
00:13:49,505 --> 00:13:51,914
and an attack, I would argue or a series of attacks.

321
00:13:52,614 --> 00:13:56,544
So I think you just set me up for what I was going to technically say a little while ago.

322
00:13:56,905 --> 00:14:01,974
I think we have this obsession in the security industry with security bugs

323
00:14:02,114 --> 00:14:03,434
and everything else, right?

324
00:14:03,445 --> 00:14:04,515
In our Venn diagram,

325
00:14:04,525 --> 00:14:08,715
we have security things in one circle and like literally the whole rest of the world

326
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,465
in another circle. And we're like, we don't care about that circle of

327
00:14:12,739 --> 00:14:15,369
and I, I think we have very tunnel vision often

328
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:20,489
and I think this is an instance where if we call it a security bug,

329
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,109
now we suddenly care about it.

330
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,479
But the reality is

331
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:27,650
this is probably technically not a security bug

332
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:30,690
from the purest technical definition of security bug.

333
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,150
But the reality is

334
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:37,159
this is AAA sequence of events that creates risk.

335
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,289
And I think in the security world instead of thinking about

336
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:44,099
like security bugs and security incidents and security events or whatever,

337
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,880
it's more of a risk

338
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,580
conversation. And any time you have an item of value,

339
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,150
there is a risk associated with that item.

340
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:57,460
Be it, someone breaks into Minecraft and steals your, your item of value.

341
00:14:57,469 --> 00:14:59,830
Well, or even I think it can be expanded beyond that. Like

342
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,239
that, you don't even have to have the item of value.

343
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:06,619
There can be a, a potential market where people want to buy stuff and

344
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:08,020
an attacker can

345
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,349
take control of it or get an advantage there.

346
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,489
Like, in the real world,

347
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,099
if a business does better advertising does a better product,

348
00:15:15,109 --> 00:15:17,530
we all agree that that's fine and kind of what we want

349
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,909
but what we don't want because there's a high

350
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,500
negative externality is like businesses burning each other down or

351
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:29,289
-- crashing their cars into their competitors store to shut them down.
-- Probably bad.

352
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,820
I, I feel like that's not a good thing for a long time.

353
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:32,890
Now,

354
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,869
I've been beginning to think that maybe

355
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,049
security vulnerabilities should be more defined by.

356
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:44,190
Does it give somebody kind of an advantage or a capability that they wouldn't?

357
00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:48,809
And I hate to use this word because it's really wishy washy but shouldn't have.

358
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,890
And secondly, as part of wrapped in with that,

359
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:55,239
does it then also create this negative externality or internal

360
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,599
that we don't want because like if there's,

361
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,780
you know, inventing better products

362
00:16:00,989 --> 00:16:04,169
and patenting them and producing them, that's what we want to happen.

363
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:08,260
But patent trolls where they patent stuff and then don't let anybody build it.

364
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,700
That seems bad.

365
00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:10,429
I mean,

366
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:10,710
that

367
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,919
seems like a problem. Patent trolls represent a risk to nearly every industry today

368
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:21,429
-- and take back human innovation.
-- It certainly does. It's a huge deal. And I think

369
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:27,409
in the context of video games, any sort of bug or behavior or ability

370
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:28,359
that

371
00:16:28,489 --> 00:16:31,330
creates problems like this, I mean, that poses a risk.

372
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:35,229
Like I, I have a marvelous example, I run a Minecraft server for my kids

373
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,159
and there was one time they invited one of their friends to

374
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:41,719
the Minecraft server and the friend showed up and literally trashed everything

375
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:43,429
and they're like, what do we do?

376
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:44,020
Seriously?

377
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:44,239
Yeah.

378
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,479
-- Right. They can have kids, man. Kids are
-- weird.

379
00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:48,969
Do they know that they're playing on somebody else's Minecraft server?

380
00:16:48,979 --> 00:16:49,659
They don't care.

381
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:53,340
And that even ignoring any technical rollbacks and stuff,

382
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,210
like you don't go to somebody's house and piss on the rug.

383
00:16:56,219 --> 00:16:57,539
-- I mean,
-- generally speaking. Yes.

384
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:58,789
But now, but, but here's the thing,

385
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:01,729
I think video games are a little different because, yeah, if the kid,

386
00:17:01,869 --> 00:17:04,848
I went to my house and trashed it, I'd be like, I'd call his parents up and be like,

387
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,339
you're, you're fixing my house,

388
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:06,848
you know.

389
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,170
Yeah, that's illegal.

390
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,239
But if someone shows up in your Minecraft server and trashes it, I'm like, well,

391
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:14,550
the lessons, like, don't invite a holes to your Minecraft server kids.

392
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:14,670
Like,

393
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,589
I don't know what else to tell you here and I had

394
00:17:16,598 --> 00:17:18,630
a backup so I put it back in place and stuff.

395
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,280
I mean, they lost a bunch of stuff but whatever. And obviously it's,

396
00:17:21,698 --> 00:17:24,208
I have magic God powers on the service.

397
00:17:24,218 --> 00:17:26,208
I'm like, here's like a million diamonds shut up

398
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:27,928
and they were happy.

399
00:17:27,938 --> 00:17:31,688
But I, I think again, this is like, this is part of the risk discussion.

400
00:17:31,698 --> 00:17:32,808
If you have a thing

401
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:33,798
and you

402
00:17:33,979 --> 00:17:35,519
apply value to it,

403
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:39,489
what are you going to do to protect it? And if you invent

404
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:43,920
invent, if you invite a massive a hole into your Minecraft world,

405
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,140
they might trash it.

406
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,359
They just can do that.

407
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:49,680
But see, the, the challenges, for example is I might have things of value,

408
00:17:49,689 --> 00:17:51,420
but I can't spend a ton of money protecting them.

409
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,859
Like my house has windows.

410
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:53,969
I like them.

411
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,050
They let the sun in.

412
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,670
But I, I can't

413
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,339
like to spend money to prevent somebody from throwing a rock through.

414
00:18:00,349 --> 00:18:02,469
One would be cost prohibitive

415
00:18:02,609 --> 00:18:05,089
-- and ugly.
-- But you have insurance for that.

416
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:05,979
Right.

417
00:18:05,989 --> 00:18:07,760
But what I'm trying to get at basically

418
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,910
is we can't protect everything that has value.

419
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,280
Right? And we can't,

420
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:16,670
-- we can't insure it always either. And,
-- and that's part of the risk decision, right?

421
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,469
Like the, the odds of someone throwing

422
00:18:18,595 --> 00:18:22,635
a rock through all your windows for no apparent reason is probably very low.

423
00:18:23,465 --> 00:18:26,046
The odds of that annoying kid, you know,

424
00:18:26,056 --> 00:18:29,196
at school trashing your Minecraft server is probably pretty high,

425
00:18:30,566 --> 00:18:33,355
but it's also, it's interesting to me that there seems to be like this.

426
00:18:33,365 --> 00:18:35,926
Oh, it's a video game. It's not real. And I would point out like

427
00:18:36,026 --> 00:18:38,156
there are Starcraft two champions who've earned

428
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,676
over a million dollars in tournament play.

429
00:18:40,806 --> 00:18:40,855
That's

430
00:18:41,056 --> 00:18:41,206
real.

431
00:18:41,462 --> 00:18:42,192
Oh, for sure.

432
00:18:42,401 --> 00:18:44,342
I think this is similar to

433
00:18:44,521 --> 00:18:46,312
the, the universe of computers.

434
00:18:46,322 --> 00:18:49,562
I, I found a funny meme the other day that was something like mom.

435
00:18:49,572 --> 00:18:52,741
Can you help me fix my computer leaning back and share.

436
00:18:52,761 --> 00:18:57,281
Oh, remember from 1994 to 2006 when you told me to get off the computer?

437
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,802
Like, who's laughing now?

438
00:18:59,332 --> 00:19:00,462
And I think

439
00:19:00,612 --> 00:19:04,241
any time you have a new technology or environment,

440
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,359
it takes a long time for the,

441
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:11,839
I guess the masses to recognize this is an item of value

442
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:17,920
because I think many of us still view, view video games as a frivolity. frivolity.

443
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,439
Like what always blows my mind is

444
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,084
go to the Apple Store and pay attention for a few minutes

445
00:19:23,185 --> 00:19:25,594
when people come in with their devices that are kind of broken.

446
00:19:25,814 --> 00:19:28,255
And what's the first question? Basically, the Apple people ask them.

447
00:19:28,265 --> 00:19:30,795
I don't know, I don't go to Apple Stores. Is this thing backed up?

448
00:19:30,805 --> 00:19:32,454
Do you have an icloud account? Do whatever?

449
00:19:32,584 --> 00:19:36,214
And I remember sitting at a table because I had to get my iphone, the speaker broke

450
00:19:36,814 --> 00:19:39,875
right in my old iphone. I see the, the speaker just broke.

451
00:19:39,925 --> 00:19:42,704
And this lady was like, oh, I've been waiting here for four hours and I'm like,

452
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:43,964
she's like, how long have you been waiting here?

453
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:47,625
I'm like about seven minutes because like, I, I booked an appointment. Like,

454
00:19:47,935 --> 00:19:48,834
anyways,

455
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:52,819
and it's funny because the guy like comes up to me and he's like, oh your iphone. I see.

456
00:19:52,829 --> 00:19:53,959
He's like, is it back? I'm like,

457
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:55,719
it's fully backed up. It's on the icloud.

458
00:19:55,729 --> 00:19:58,729
I have a verified backup from like two hours ago. He's like, oh,

459
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,949
ok then. And he, like, just turns around and leaves.

460
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:05,479
Right. He doesn't, he doesn't even bother talking the rest of his spiel.

461
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,050
Yeah.

462
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,890
Yeah. And the lady's like,

463
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,260
it's backed up and I'm like,

464
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,349
yeah. And she's like, how did you do that? And I'm like,

465
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,920
you, you log into icloud.

466
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,510
No. No, it's. No,

467
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,579
-- no.
-- And I know,

468
00:20:17,469 --> 00:20:19,239
I know. I know. But, but the,

469
00:20:19,369 --> 00:20:21,719
the thing is Apple's made it as easy as possible.

470
00:20:21,729 --> 00:20:23,760
But the point I actually want to get to is people say, oh,

471
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:26,040
there's nothing important on my phone and you say, ok,

472
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,680
all the photos on your phone are gone.

473
00:20:27,689 --> 00:20:29,119
Would that make you sad? And they go

474
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:29,839
oh,

475
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,030
yeah,

476
00:20:31,219 --> 00:20:34,560
-- I would rather lose my wallet than my phone. It's
-- way

477
00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:36,130
-- to replace
-- for real,

478
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:37,130
right? Like,

479
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,410
well, actually in this case, like, yeah. Oh man, those two of a things

480
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,150
like,

481
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,479
I don't care because everything's backed up off my phone except for some of the

482
00:20:43,489 --> 00:20:46,119
two of a stuff which is not supposed to be backed up or whatever,

483
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,089
that'll be a pass key show sometime in the future.

484
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,849
But that's the thing, right? Like, yeah, it's

485
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,839
people sort of still view digital as being like,

486
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,160
not

487
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,770
real and not

488
00:20:58,069 --> 00:20:59,449
valuable, even

489
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,469
not people,

490
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,199
people of a certain age

491
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,719
because we,

492
00:21:05,729 --> 00:21:11,040
I'd say people our age and above probably are willing to pawn off a

493
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:14,800
lot of video games and digital things as having little to no value.

494
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:18,930
Whereas young people, I think often see the value in this. I have

495
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:21,199
kids who have spent

496
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:26,040
like hundreds and hundreds of dollars buying virtual crap in a game. And I'm like,

497
00:21:26,349 --> 00:21:30,380
-- I feel like you're wasting your money but you like it so good job. Like
-- there was a,

498
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:33,020
there was a good thing on a side bit on Linus

499
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,729
tech tips or one of their things where they were talking

500
00:21:34,739 --> 00:21:37,880
about the whales in these online games and how they'll basically

501
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:41,109
make items specific to that whale because they know that that

502
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:43,890
whale wants to collect like all the big blue swords.

503
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,290
And so they'll make one that cost 10 grand and that

504
00:21:46,699 --> 00:21:47,609
they'll sell one.

505
00:21:47,619 --> 00:21:50,280
But I mean, if it takes your art, everybody to, you know,

506
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:52,430
a day or two to make the sword and you sell it for 10 grand,

507
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:53,839
that's a no brainer.

508
00:21:54,489 --> 00:21:58,119
Like there's just, there's these whales that dude, we spend four bucks on coffee.

509
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:01,640
-- That is some people's food budget for the month.
-- I don't, I'm a cheapskate.

510
00:22:03,109 --> 00:22:05,260
How much is that microphone you're speaking into? Worth?

511
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,750
Like we, we have things that we like to spend money.

512
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,390
It's funny you bring that up is I recorded some

513
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,209
things for work the other day and they're like,

514
00:22:12,219 --> 00:22:13,619
wow, your audio is really good.

515
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:17,079
And I said it better be, I'm talking through $400 worth of audio equipment.

516
00:22:17,089 --> 00:22:21,579
Like my voice to my computer passes through $400 worth of gear.

517
00:22:21,589 --> 00:22:24,500
And in fact, I just bought a new thing that's coming in the mail today,

518
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,979
which I'm very excited for.

519
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:26,930
I was, uh Paul Aci

520
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:28,750
who listens to our show.

521
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,130
I found out and we were on his show at one point, I'll put a link in the show.

522
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:31,819
Not so I'll dig it up.

523
00:22:32,109 --> 00:22:35,489
But he put a link on Mastodon to a cough box he uses,

524
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,930
which is basically push the button mute yourself.

525
00:22:39,339 --> 00:22:42,849
Well, I didn't buy the one. He suggested because I found a different one

526
00:22:42,979 --> 00:22:47,680
that has a switch for either push to mute or push to talk so I can switch it.

527
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,300
I'm like, oh, this is really cool. Yeah.

528
00:22:49,819 --> 00:22:52,369
Well, but does it work? I don't know. It was,

529
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:56,140
I did well on Va Nature's website and I ordered it and so we're gonna see how it works.

530
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,849
But if it works, yes, I will totally send it to you because there are,

531
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,040
there are instances where I want to push to mute and

532
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:04,280
there are also instances where I want push to talk.

533
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:07,680
And so having either or is immensely valuable to me.

534
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:11,089
No, that, that seems like an obvious thing to put in.

535
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,109
Like if you're building push to mute, why not?

536
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:16,800
And if it's like a $5 item,

537
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,709
whatever, make it as cheap as possible, I'm guessing it's not $5.

538
00:23:19,719 --> 00:23:21,619
Uh No, this one is like 60 bucks.

539
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,310
I think it's still like here's the thing I

540
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,410
love is most audio equipment because it's targeting like,

541
00:23:26,449 --> 00:23:26,939
like

542
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:31,550
musicians with no money. It's usually pretty cheap. Like, and I love that.

543
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,109
So you just keep buying stuff.

544
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:37,099
It's like, what's the answer to how many guitars is the right number of guitars?

545
00:23:37,109 --> 00:23:40,239
One more than you have. How many bicycles is the right number of bicycles?

546
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:43,140
One more than you have. How many microphones is the right number of microphones?

547
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,459
One more than you have.

548
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:48,020
-- I
-- say this. Yeah, there's, let's see, all my death. There's 12,

549
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,060
-- there was only 23, not counting the headset.
-- I have

550
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:56,569
about five and in the, the dresser

551
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,209
in front of me because I put all my audio equipment

552
00:23:59,219 --> 00:24:02,650
in a dresser because II I expanded too much for the,

553
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,520
the crate.

554
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:03,579
I

555
00:24:03,729 --> 00:24:04,530
had it done

556
00:24:05,829 --> 00:24:06,880
anyway. Anyway.

557
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,920
So back to this, I think, I think we need to, like you said,

558
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:12,839
we need to expand the universe because to me there's like,

559
00:24:13,329 --> 00:24:13,839
there's,

560
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:16,969
ah, this is what's replacing potholes,

561
00:24:17,479 --> 00:24:18,239
the sewer line.

562
00:24:18,729 --> 00:24:22,880
So theyre paved the street a chunk of it. It's, it's gloriously flat. Like, oh my God.

563
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:25,150
-- So flat.
-- I play some street hockey on that side

564
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:26,890
-- and, well,
-- it's pretty busy. Bit of road.

565
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:28,589
Just put cones up. It's fine.

566
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:29,939
But

567
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:34,079
cor was out doing stuff in the sewer line again. And I'm like the heck

568
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,170
and I, I actually, as I'm driving by, I pause and I'm like, hey, I'm like,

569
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:37,890
what are you guys doing?

570
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,680
You cleaning the sewers? He's like, yes, I'm like, didn't you guys do that?

571
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:43,209
Like, three or four months ago? And he's like, also. Yes.

572
00:24:43,469 --> 00:24:44,109
And I'm like,

573
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,619
what?

574
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:49,400
And he's like, one of your neighbors is dumping a lot of grease down their drain.

575
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:51,500
And I'm like, is it you? Yeah.

576
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:54,359
And I'm like, well, it's not me because, like, I eat all my bacon grease.

577
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:56,119
My mom's German. We don't waste, like,

578
00:24:56,349 --> 00:24:57,410
grease is food.

579
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:58,050
You don't

580
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:00,880
throw it away. It is food. It's like I fry my bacon

581
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:01,560
and

582
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,979
I leave the grease in the pan because the next

583
00:25:04,989 --> 00:25:07,140
morning I'm gonna fry some eggs in that delicious grease.

584
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,819
I do not leave grease in the pan. I filter it that way.

585
00:25:09,829 --> 00:25:11,020
It doesn't have chunks of garbage.

586
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,069
I like it.

587
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,790
I, I have a joke with my kids where I'll make something and they, I'll be like,

588
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,930
do you know what the secret ingredients is, is kids?

589
00:25:17,939 --> 00:25:19,910
And they'll be like, love. I'm like, nope, it's bacon grease,

590
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:22,729
butter

591
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:22,949
and

592
00:25:23,229 --> 00:25:25,430
bacon grease is just butter with salt.

593
00:25:25,969 --> 00:25:27,150
It's just salted butter.

594
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:29,069
It's bacon flavored butter.

595
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,579
Pretty much.

596
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:34,219
So. Anyways. But what's interesting. So, it's a 10 inch sewer line

597
00:25:34,439 --> 00:25:36,170
and obviously it's got a bit of slope to it.

598
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:39,979
But I was like, how much I'm like, so it's getting like fat birds. He's like, exactly.

599
00:25:39,989 --> 00:25:40,219
Yeah.

600
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:42,729
And I'm like, how much does it, like, how bad is it?

601
00:25:42,739 --> 00:25:45,300
He's like, honestly, like, once you get about an inch, it's a problem

602
00:25:46,589 --> 00:25:49,270
and it kind of makes sense because it's not, it's not under pressure being pumped,

603
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,359
it's just free flowing.

604
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:51,339
Right.

605
00:25:51,469 --> 00:25:54,699
Like, I remember talking to a city engineer about their Y2K plans and he's like,

606
00:25:54,709 --> 00:25:56,089
well for the water system,

607
00:25:56,099 --> 00:25:58,859
there's about 2 to 3 days of water in the system under pressure.

608
00:25:58,869 --> 00:25:59,510
So we're good.

609
00:25:59,689 --> 00:26:01,280
And as far as sewage goes, like

610
00:26:01,489 --> 00:26:02,199
gravity,

611
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:07,150
like that's, that's our answer to Y2K compliance is gravity.

612
00:26:07,949 --> 00:26:12,469
But that means if you get like a one inch kind of little dam at the bottom.

613
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:16,010
Yeah, that's gonna cause problems. It's gonna be pretty damn gross.

614
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,849
And it got me thinking about this, like,

615
00:26:17,859 --> 00:26:23,829
people dumping grease down their drain has a massive external impact for, well,

616
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:25,530
literally everybody upstream of them.

617
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:25,739
Yes.

618
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,390
That's right.

619
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,410
And I, I think that's kind of how,

620
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,510
that's sort of slowly where I'm starting to

621
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,239
push my thinking about these security vulnerabilities is,

622
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:33,890
it's more like,

623
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,609
is this a situation where somebody has to come out and clean the pipes?

624
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:40,119
Well, I think the other, well,

625
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:44,609
the other piece of it though is if I can make this someone else's problem,

626
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,050
I don't have to care.

627
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:46,719
Right.

628
00:26:46,729 --> 00:26:50,520
And this is the same thing with, like, look at two B, two T, it's not their problem.

629
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:51,319
They don't care.

630
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,300
And, well,

631
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,209
and that's the thing though is I do have to care because I'm upstream of

632
00:26:55,219 --> 00:26:57,750
them on the sewer line and I would like to flush my toilets and,

633
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:58,699
I mean, you do.

634
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:00,180
But they don't.

635
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:00,810
Well,

636
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,989
yeah. And so I like, again, back to L TT.

637
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,540
Uh, I think it was Luke was commenting, you know,

638
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,760
where would this industry be if we didn't have to worry about security?

639
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,089
Right. How much advance

640
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,349
stuff would we have if we didn't have to spend

641
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:14,619
all this time doing compliance and security and risk management?

642
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:15,810
-- You know,
-- I mean,

643
00:27:16,209 --> 00:27:19,199
-- that's a ridiculous statement. I think it
-- is but it's,

644
00:27:19,329 --> 00:27:23,000
well, uh chemical plants, for example, by and large,

645
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,969
they put a fence around it and that's their physical security.

646
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:28,079
They don't build the plant hardened.

647
00:27:28,089 --> 00:27:31,069
So that like if somebody gets in and starts trying to blow it up,

648
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:33,040
it's gonna be able to withstand that.

649
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:36,160
Right. The assumption is you just keep people out of it and whatever.

650
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,219
Uh I've been watching a lot of those chemical safety board videos recently.

651
00:27:39,229 --> 00:27:40,180
There's some good ones.

652
00:27:40,579 --> 00:27:43,609
Uh, there's a lot of like welding defects that result in the kaboom.

653
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,969
I, I have no doubt. I have no doubt and

654
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:50,140
stuff. I think you can look at the history of pollution.

655
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,660
Like companies were just like, we'll,

656
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,589
we'll build our factory on the river because then we can throw whatever we

657
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:57,569
want in the river and it floats down the river and it's fine.

658
00:27:57,579 --> 00:27:57,739
I mean,

659
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:02,449
this is why the south side of most North American cities are the less desirable place

660
00:28:02,655 --> 00:28:04,275
to live. Because historically,

661
00:28:04,584 --> 00:28:05,314
because the rivers flow,

662
00:28:05,755 --> 00:28:08,175
you dumped everything into the river and no

663
00:28:08,185 --> 00:28:10,275
one wanted to live downstream of the factories.

664
00:28:10,285 --> 00:28:11,824
So the land was worthless

665
00:28:11,935 --> 00:28:15,025
because you needed the water and to live. You know,

666
00:28:15,344 --> 00:28:20,454
and I think security is a similar situation where if you ignore it

667
00:28:20,614 --> 00:28:22,925
and you can push the, the, the,

668
00:28:23,084 --> 00:28:26,574
the risk and the problems onto someone else.

669
00:28:27,285 --> 00:28:28,125
Not my problem. I don't

670
00:28:28,395 --> 00:28:28,454
care.

671
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,020
Yeah, the cost. There you go. Cost cost is

672
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:31,410
the

673
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:31,880
cost.

674
00:28:32,109 --> 00:28:32,540
Yeah.

675
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:33,260
Yeah.

676
00:28:33,709 --> 00:28:34,060
And,

677
00:28:34,069 --> 00:28:36,099
and this is where I think sometimes you

678
00:28:36,109 --> 00:28:39,739
need things like regulation to step in because

679
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:41,699
I mean, let's face it if

680
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:43,819
I was talking to actually, uh uh

681
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,410
one of our local government representatives here one time and it

682
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:50,300
was about cybersecurity because this guy was really good about it.

683
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,199
And I made the comment, I'm like,

684
00:28:51,209 --> 00:28:53,560
look if companies could make money throwing puppies

685
00:28:53,569 --> 00:28:54,979
and wood chippers and get away with it.

686
00:28:54,989 --> 00:28:59,250
They do it like we need regulation because there are,

687
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,219
I'm not saying like there are good companies

688
00:29:01,229 --> 00:29:02,900
but there are plenty of companies that like,

689
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,579
all they care about is making money

690
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,500
and that's it.

691
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:06,050
Like,

692
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,920
-- it doesn't matter
-- how one thing I've noticed is

693
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,699
when I talk like locally here in Canada,

694
00:29:09,709 --> 00:29:11,640
we have a lot of, I would call evil companies.

695
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,660
Like every phone carrier is evil.

696
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:16,339
But when you actually talk to people that work for them, they're not.

697
00:29:16,869 --> 00:29:17,579
Well, no, the people

698
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:18,540
are good.

699
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:19,739
-- It's just
-- the,

700
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:20,260
the

701
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:21,229
op

702
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:22,209
oppo

703
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:24,699
corporate structures that have become

704
00:29:24,859 --> 00:29:24,869
a

705
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:27,020
de facto standard in Canada.

706
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:29,140
They're problematic.

707
00:29:29,739 --> 00:29:31,020
Right. I pay, I pay

708
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,489
basically my internet and phone bill

709
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:37,449
is the equivalent of like, what a small neighborhood in Europe would pay.

710
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,750
I believe that

711
00:29:39,939 --> 00:29:42,449
I've seen those European bills and I'm like, oh, my goodness,

712
00:29:42,459 --> 00:29:43,949
you have no idea how good you have it.

713
00:29:43,959 --> 00:29:45,280
-- It's like
-- €25.

714
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,199
But that's also my cable bill. So it's ok. And I'm like, well, what now? Huh?

715
00:29:49,369 --> 00:29:49,569
Yeah.

716
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:50,729
Right. Exactly.

717
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:53,719
Why is it so expensive Europeans? No, I know. I pay

718
00:29:53,829 --> 00:29:55,530
100 bucks for internet every month.

719
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:58,390
Gigabit. I mean, it's gigabit so I'll take it. But

720
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:01,810
I still think like 100 bucks for internet is preposterous.

721
00:30:01,819 --> 00:30:03,300
It's way more than it should be,

722
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:07,229
but whatever, whatever. All right, we gotta wrap this one up.

723
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:08,189
We're running out of time.

724
00:30:08,329 --> 00:30:10,010
I go watch that youtube video.

725
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:13,030
It's seriously, it's 13 minutes of, it's a, it's a heist movie.

726
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,699
-- It's awesome.
-- I'm excited.

727
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:17,869
I, I also love heist movies. I will say it. It

728
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,729
is like one of my guilty pleasures.

729
00:30:19,739 --> 00:30:20,670
My joke is always,

730
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:25,270
I only watch movies with wizards or spaceships in them except heist movies.

731
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,030
I love heist movies and you know what the best part is.

732
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,500
I'm not a particularly smart person so I almost never

733
00:30:31,604 --> 00:30:34,584
figure it out until the reveal at the end which just delights me.

734
00:30:34,635 --> 00:30:35,584
There's nothing worse.

735
00:30:35,594 --> 00:30:38,905
Than watching one of these movies with one of my kids or my dad because they, like,

736
00:30:38,915 --> 00:30:41,145
figure this stuff out right away and they're like, oh, that guy did it.

737
00:30:41,155 --> 00:30:43,255
I'm like, don't you ruin the movie?

738
00:30:43,594 --> 00:30:43,614
I,

739
00:30:43,984 --> 00:30:45,744
I wanted to figure it out.

740
00:30:46,104 --> 00:30:47,785
-- But anyway, anyway, I
-- was an aside,

741
00:30:47,795 --> 00:30:49,614
if you want to see a really great classic

742
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:52,194
heist movie that isn't portrayed as a heist movie.

743
00:30:52,204 --> 00:30:53,604
-- Inception.
-- Is that a heist movie?

744
00:30:53,614 --> 00:30:56,594
-- Yeah, it kind of is, I would,
-- I, I'm not kind of, it's,

745
00:30:56,675 --> 00:30:58,885
they literally break into the guy's,

746
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:00,540
I suppose

747
00:31:00,689 --> 00:31:01,500
that's true.

748
00:31:01,709 --> 00:31:03,780
Apologies. I should have said spoilers ahead.

749
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,439
Maybe bleep that part out

750
00:31:05,609 --> 00:31:07,390
at this point. Everyone knows.

751
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,209
Uh

752
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,969
There's gonna be somebody who hasn't seen it yet.

753
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,050
I'll bleep it out.

754
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:14,459
-- Yeah,
-- just bleep it out. It'll be funnier. It's like the thing with Memento, right?

755
00:31:14,469 --> 00:31:15,619
-- There's still people that don't
-- know.

756
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:18,859
I've never seen Memento. I don't even know what that is. Is it a movie?

757
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:19,579
Yes.

758
00:31:19,739 --> 00:31:20,250
Ok.

759
00:31:20,859 --> 00:31:21,060
I don't

760
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:21,859
very, very

761
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,459
clearly doesn't have a wizard or a spaceship in it or I might know about it, but

762
00:31:25,709 --> 00:31:27,079
that's a wizard. Technically

763
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,219
I need to find him. But uh

764
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:29,750
yeah. No,

765
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,910
I really, I think you're right about the Venn diagram of where we, we,

766
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,449
it has to be serious business security.

767
00:31:36,709 --> 00:31:37,540
Yeah, for sure.

768
00:31:37,699 --> 00:31:38,089
But I, I

769
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,810
think this is where I would encourage people don't

770
00:31:40,819 --> 00:31:43,810
think about security issues or bugs or events.

771
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:46,010
Think about everything as a giant

772
00:31:46,349 --> 00:31:47,729
risk discussion.

773
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:51,489
And I think that makes it easier to bring much more reality into the fold.

774
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,530
That's what I found.

775
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:54,869
And any time I can,

776
00:31:55,109 --> 00:31:58,410
I talk about risk as the driving force behind something.

777
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:02,060
And it's amazing how much that changes the discussion

778
00:32:02,439 --> 00:32:05,380
when you're, especially when you're talking to security people out for blood.

779
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,869
All right, I'm calling it. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.

Go to open source Security podcast.com. Hit up the show notes, UZ Pound

782
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,050
Why do you keep laughing every time you say that?

783
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:22,739
Like uh X is, I mean, it's just we both turned our accounts off. It's done like, yeah.

784
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,219
Right. I know.

785
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,109
Anyway,
