Hi, old Josh here. As some of you may have heard

1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,300
the podcast is going to be on a bit of a hiatus for a little while.

2
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:11,640
Kurt put a thing on Mastodon or he's going through a bit of a family emergency.

3
00:00:11,649 --> 00:00:15,060
So if you wouldn't mind reaching out to him on Mastodon or email,

4
00:00:15,069 --> 00:00:15,859
telling him to hang in,

5
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:19,100
there would be certainly much appreciated when life gives you lemons,

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,649
we make lemonade and burn life's house down.

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,899
So I'm using this opportunity to take some of the old episodes we have

8
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:28,110
and remaster them into something

9
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:33,509
a little more modern now that the technology and tooling has improved immensely

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,150
over the last five plus years that we've been doing the show.

11
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:41,849
So today we're going to look back at episode 42 which is all about Hitchhiker's guide

12
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,590
to the Galaxy and it was a lot of fun to re listens to it.

13
00:00:44,599 --> 00:00:44,990
And

14
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:49,509
just for a bit of fact, for later in the show, Kurt did not pad the staircase.

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,830
That will make sense later on.

16
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,389
So I hope you enjoy it. Thank you so much. Talk to you all soon.

17
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,989
Hello and welcome to episode 42 of the open source security podcast with myself,

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,779
Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime.

19
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:07,629
Josh Bresser.

20
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,370
40 two.

21
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,879
We all know what that means. Right. Kurt.

22
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:11,629
How

23
00:01:11,809 --> 00:01:14,500
-- will they?
-- That's right. Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy.

24
00:01:14,589 --> 00:01:18,300
I, I was thinking about this and I, I it needs no intro because let's face it.

25
00:01:18,309 --> 00:01:20,919
If you're listening to the show and you know what Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,

26
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,099
it's just like, shame on you.

27
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:22,220
Right.

28
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,830
Like, go just shame. That's all I have to say. There's no excuse.

29
00:01:25,839 --> 00:01:29,269
And yeah, there's nothing else to say about FF So anyway,

30
00:01:29,279 --> 00:01:32,529
episode 42 we naturally thought it would be fun to do something.

31
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,470
Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy related. So, what do we do, Kirk?

32
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,910
Well, I guess we could sort of dissect the film in its various security related.

33
00:01:39,919 --> 00:01:43,410
-- No,
-- you don't guess that's what we better do because that's what I prepared for.

34
00:01:43,559 --> 00:01:44,059
Like,

35
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:45,550
uh

36
00:01:45,669 --> 00:01:48,080
when we realized episode 42 is coming,

37
00:01:48,089 --> 00:01:51,050
Kurt said we should do something about Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy.

38
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:53,190
And I thought, yeah, we should read the book

39
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,860
and then look for security things

40
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,629
and uh yeah, it's a really long book. So we decided

41
00:01:58,779 --> 00:02:03,349
that the next best thing would be to watch the movie because that only will eat

42
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,669
an hour and a half of my life instead of probably a week of reading.

43
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,190
So, yeah. Yeah, that's good. And, and I guess for those of you who don't know.

44
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,860
Also a radio show

45
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,830
and the radio show in all seriousness is my favorite of the three formats.

46
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,830
I love the radio show,

47
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:20,009
Juan, just to be clear,

48
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,389
I have not heard the radio show and speaking of the three formats,

49
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:24,389
there's then also the TV series from, what was it?

50
00:02:24,399 --> 00:02:26,740
1981?

51
00:02:27,029 --> 00:02:29,580
Oh, that's right. That terrible TV show.

52
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,809
It was so terrible. It was awesome.

53
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:32,000
I

54
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:32,690
love it as

55
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,089
it crosses that line. It has like that in

56
00:02:35,369 --> 00:02:35,460
the

57
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:36,350
thing.

58
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:40,283
It was, it was like the doctor who's special effects team from the BBC,

59
00:02:41,373 --> 00:02:42,272
the way they did.

60
00:02:42,373 --> 00:02:42,432
Zaha's

61
00:02:42,783 --> 00:02:43,382
head is a para,

62
00:02:43,673 --> 00:02:45,093
I thought it was awesome. It was paper mache.

63
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:48,682
-- It was so God awful.
-- It was clearly fake. That's the best part.

64
00:02:48,703 --> 00:02:52,203
Like they obviously didn't even try to make it real, you know.

65
00:02:53,063 --> 00:02:53,533
Anyway.

66
00:02:53,983 --> 00:02:54,272
So

67
00:02:54,992 --> 00:02:58,203
yeah, we opted for the shortest sort of most up to date format right

68
00:02:58,453 --> 00:03:00,363
time and also I guess, be uh

69
00:03:00,865 --> 00:03:04,156
-- accessible to our viewers. So
-- that's actually something else you, you bring up.

70
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,455
And this is an important point is

71
00:03:06,755 --> 00:03:10,516
when I watched this movie, I, I get annoyed by it for a variety of reasons,

72
00:03:10,526 --> 00:03:14,576
but I know one of the intentions Douglas Adams always had was that

73
00:03:14,725 --> 00:03:18,055
his story isn't set in stone at one time.

74
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:21,205
And so like he helped write the screenplay, you know,

75
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,216
this isn't just some crazy Hollywood screenwriter that went nuts

76
00:03:24,589 --> 00:03:25,130
and

77
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:30,199
he wanted it updated to match the times he didn't want it to take place back in what,

78
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,149
the seventies or sixties or whenever the original happened.

79
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,850
And so

80
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:34,520
it,

81
00:03:34,529 --> 00:03:36,800
as much as I get annoyed by some of the things

82
00:03:36,809 --> 00:03:39,570
I'm very sympathetic to the fact that they updated the story.

83
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,130
Like Arthur has a cell phone.

84
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:42,759
You know, that, that's cool.

85
00:03:43,309 --> 00:03:45,610
And which, which was even funny though because it's not,

86
00:03:45,619 --> 00:03:47,009
it's not like an iphone or anything.

87
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,320
I'm like, ah,

88
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:47,990
he's got a

89
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:48,660
gray phone.

90
00:03:49,339 --> 00:03:52,059
I kind of like that. They at least, yeah, it's a smartphone, at least.

91
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,979
Although if he'd had a flip phone, it would have just looked ridiculous.

92
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:58,270
-- Was it a
-- smartphone? And I thought it was just a candy bar quasi.

93
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,720
Well, it was, it was a candy bar phone but it wasn't like a flip phone or anything

94
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:04,509
and it kind of had like, graphics on it and stuff and, you know,

95
00:04:04,649 --> 00:04:07,399
anyway, let, let, let's dive in, man, let's dive in.

96
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,210
I'm gonna start with, with that Dolphin. So

97
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,779
I know I hate that song. I'm not even going to pretend like, I hate that song.

98
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:18,170
That song revolts me when I hear it and I don't have a good reason for it.

99
00:04:18,178 --> 00:04:18,519
It just,

100
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:22,980
I hate that intro and I think that sets me up for failure for the rest of this movie.

101
00:04:22,989 --> 00:04:23,730
Well, I mean,

102
00:04:23,739 --> 00:04:28,119
I have six year olds so I get to hear Baby Shark 10 times a day off of youtube.

103
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:28,720
You know,

104
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:33,779
I do remember those days and in fact, my daughter was, what was she about? I

105
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,730
think when, when frozen came out and that song let it go.

106
00:04:37,109 --> 00:04:40,380
I heard that at least 10 times a day for months.

107
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:44,089
My one son does that song and it's hilarious because he's just,

108
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,649
he only does like the few sort of highlights

109
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,820
and he literally stands there with his hands in his pockets and

110
00:04:49,929 --> 00:04:51,920
then he, like, do a twirl on his heels.

111
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:54,269
He'll do like the hair sweep gestures

112
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:59,850
and like, just occasionally belt out, let it go, you know, like sort of off key.

113
00:04:59,859 --> 00:05:03,980
I'm glad you, you did an escape but he let it go craze. So, anyway, anyway,

114
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,720
I

115
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:10,459
don't think there's any legitimate security topics or nuance in, in the theme.

116
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,600
-- Oh, there's
-- a huge one.

117
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,079
Well, it's a huge one. Well, they did say they tried to warn everyone.

118
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:19,160
-- Lack of
-- communications. Yeah. How many, how many times has a firm been warned of

119
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:24,399
a, not a potential hack but an actual real hack. Like a hack going on and just been like

120
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:24,589
there

121
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,779
or how many times has a security researcher tried to report

122
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,380
a vulnerability to a company only to be shuffled to,

123
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,970
like, tech support who's like, oh, you don't have a contract with us.

124
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,049
We can't listen to you.

125
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,980
Yeah, I think that's, but that,

126
00:05:35,989 --> 00:05:39,619
that's an overarching theme to the whole story of the fact

127
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,829
that there are many warnings in many places for many reasons

128
00:05:43,119 --> 00:05:45,140
and they are almost universally ignored and

129
00:05:45,369 --> 00:05:49,250
it's, it's less so in the movie. But in the, in the book, obviously, like Lar

130
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:53,570
warns these guys countless times of their peril and they never listen

131
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:55,429
-- to him and they usually yell at him and tell him to
-- show

132
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:58,040
if they did though, the story wouldn't have advanced,

133
00:05:58,049 --> 00:05:59,420
which I think is also an important point.

134
00:05:59,429 --> 00:06:01,829
-- Sometimes you have to do dangerous things.
-- That is true.

135
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,720
So, anyway, anyway, let's ignore the movie and we can open up on Arthur Dent

136
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:07,869
house. And

137
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,220
so

138
00:06:09,451 --> 00:06:10,932
the plans are in the cellar.

139
00:06:11,131 --> 00:06:12,451
-- Oh, no, no,
-- no, it's worse than that.

140
00:06:12,462 --> 00:06:14,731
But that the 1st 30 seconds of the film,

141
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:17,731
he smashes his head on that stairway overhang,

142
00:06:17,742 --> 00:06:19,532
apparently every single day of morning,

143
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:22,071
why didn't he put some padding on it or a warning sign or?

144
00:06:22,252 --> 00:06:22,631
Ok.

145
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:27,131
So they, they miss this in the movie, but in the book and the radio show,

146
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:29,332
they kind of come to the point that he is hung over.

147
00:06:29,342 --> 00:06:30,652
Well, that's my point. Right.

148
00:06:30,661 --> 00:06:31,691
He should fix,

149
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:34,433
you should deal with that issue and something about it because nobody does,

150
00:06:34,444 --> 00:06:36,773
like he's going to smash his head every single day.

151
00:06:36,783 --> 00:06:37,324
Kurt,

152
00:06:37,334 --> 00:06:40,194
normal humans will smash their head every day

153
00:06:40,243 --> 00:06:42,114
and they will never do anything about it.

154
00:06:42,123 --> 00:06:43,313
And that's the,

155
00:06:43,324 --> 00:06:46,794
-- that parallels our whole security industry
-- because I actually

156
00:06:46,803 --> 00:06:48,153
have to do this at my parents' cabin.

157
00:06:48,164 --> 00:06:50,093
There's a staircase and the way it comes down it's

158
00:06:50,104 --> 00:06:51,993
like an inch and a half shorter than me.

159
00:06:52,003 --> 00:06:52,993
Did you pad it?

160
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:56,234
I'm actually, I didn't do that last year, but this year I am padding it.

161
00:06:56,243 --> 00:06:57,144
You say you're padding it?

162
00:06:57,196 --> 00:07:00,466
-- I'm going to, I'm going to check on you next year and see if you've padded
-- it.

163
00:07:00,656 --> 00:07:04,286
-- It's on my to do list.
-- I bet there's a 50% chance of you not doing it.

164
00:07:04,295 --> 00:07:07,545
-- I'm doing it actually next week
-- now you will to prove you wrong. But

165
00:07:07,726 --> 00:07:10,665
-- anyway,
-- I just all smashed from my ass.

166
00:07:11,385 --> 00:07:11,466
It

167
00:07:11,686 --> 00:07:12,466
really hurts.

168
00:07:12,476 --> 00:07:13,376
But anyway,

169
00:07:13,385 --> 00:07:18,265
so the first thing I realized is when Arthur Dent is talking to Mr Prosser,

170
00:07:18,276 --> 00:07:21,055
who is the gentleman with the briefcase who works for the government.

171
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,739
And he tells him that the plans have been un displaying the planning department

172
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:28,380
for, you know, the last six months or a year or whatever it was. And

173
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:29,859
it occurs to me that

174
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,589
this is how the security rules work in these organizations for like, yeah,

175
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,989
we've got all these rules but you know,

176
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,670
like they're literally in the basement in a locked finally cabinet, you know,

177
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:38,230
and the sign

178
00:07:38,369 --> 00:07:40,730
use lavatory with the sign says a beware leopard like

179
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:44,380
-- that is basically how it works
-- well or even vendors,

180
00:07:44,489 --> 00:07:46,970
how many vendors have a security page where like

181
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:51,750
you either know the keywords to find it in Google or you bookmarked it because

182
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:54,815
you know, some vendors you go blah, blah slash security.

183
00:07:54,825 --> 00:07:56,674
And it just works and there's a security page there but

184
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,614
a lot of vendors you do that and it's like nothing.

185
00:07:59,225 --> 00:08:01,015
I mean, that, that's totally true. Is

186
00:08:01,174 --> 00:08:01,394
it?

187
00:08:01,404 --> 00:08:04,855
It's very much that when you are dealing with bureaucracy,

188
00:08:04,864 --> 00:08:08,774
if you know the combination to kind of get through all the doors of bureaucracy,

189
00:08:08,785 --> 00:08:09,355
you're fine.

190
00:08:09,524 --> 00:08:12,355
But if you're a normal person you're screwed because there is

191
00:08:12,364 --> 00:08:14,234
no way you're gonna figure out what you need to do.

192
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:17,345
Which, which as soon as I saw that I thought of security

193
00:08:17,609 --> 00:08:20,390
where if you know the security magic words and you

194
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,820
know how to talk to the industry and the people,

195
00:08:22,859 --> 00:08:23,429
you're fine.

196
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,470
Right. No big deal. You can get anywhere you need to go.

197
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:28,859
But if you're a normal person who kind of just shows up, you're doomed.

198
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:32,710
You, you have no hope. Is that a bad thing necessarily?

199
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,409
Yes and no, I, I think we, we do miss the, see,

200
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:40,789
I think it does lead to false negatives in that stuff that really should be.

201
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:40,945
It

202
00:08:41,075 --> 00:08:42,354
isn't or, and I mean,

203
00:08:42,364 --> 00:08:46,184
how many cases of researchers finding something and giving up have happened?

204
00:08:46,294 --> 00:08:49,354
-- Well, we, we literally by definition don't know. Yeah,
-- I mean

205
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:52,534
that, yes, exactly. But at the same time,

206
00:08:52,705 --> 00:08:57,015
you also can't have your security team inundated with pointless requests.

207
00:08:57,364 --> 00:08:58,585
So it, I don't know.

208
00:08:58,594 --> 00:09:01,515
I think there's a balance you have to find and, and I think that we,

209
00:09:01,525 --> 00:09:04,094
we tend to fall more on the kind of bureaucratic,

210
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:08,049
let's keep everyone outside except those who know the secret knock.

211
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,179
Part of what I've been doing with the DWF is, I mean, that, that's why, you know,

212
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,940
you have to use your email address so we can contact you.

213
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:15,539
And also

214
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:19,659
so long term it's like, oh, that's Tavis Ormandy or? Oh, that's Josh Bresser's.

215
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:19,929
Yeah,

216
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,760
I will deal with him right away because I know it's

217
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,380
not going to be very painful and it's probably real versus,

218
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:28,359
you know, like, I, you know, looking at these CV requests, I mean,

219
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:30,179
some of them are just terrible.

220
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:34,070
Like, it's just so poorly formatted or the information is so sketchy.

221
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,159
I'm like, I'm not going to spend two hours fig, you know, trying to figure this out.

222
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,369
Yeah, I, I'm familiar with that.

223
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,760
I, I remember getting some of those but,

224
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:43,299
but I must say if Tavis shows up you've got a lot of work to do.

225
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,099
Yeah.

226
00:09:44,979 --> 00:09:45,109
Yeah.

227
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:47,890
Especially if he shows up at, like Friday at four o'clock and, you know,

228
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,890
you're really up the creek,

229
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,010
your weekend is ruined.

230
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,580
But, uh, well, and even simple instructions, like, I, you know,

231
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:57,059
you have to put in a working email address for me to, you know, be able to contact you

232
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:01,669
to be able to agree to the terms of use, for example. And, like, people fail to do that.

233
00:10:01,789 --> 00:10:02,010
Yeah.

234
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,049
I mean, it seems totally reasonable anyway, anyway,

235
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:06,700
let's let's keep on track because we've got a lot of movie to cover.

236
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,469
So, so the next thing I want to talk about is the

237
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,690
Vogons are an A PT attack

238
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,869
where there is literally nothing you can do and even trying to plan for it

239
00:10:16,969 --> 00:10:18,880
-- is a waste of time.
-- Well, but see, the VGOs

240
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,429
aren't even the A PT attack. It's spoiler alert here.

241
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,109
-- No,
-- you don't need to say spoiler alert.

242
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:26,190
We've ruined, we're, we're gonna ruin this movie

243
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:26,840
again

244
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,010
if you haven't seen it. Like, why are you listening?

245
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,469
What's, what is the, the lady's

246
00:10:31,789 --> 00:10:33,020
Tricia mcmillan Trillion?

247
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,849
-- No,
-- not Trisha,

248
00:10:33,859 --> 00:10:36,000
the lady that was the assistant or whatever to

249
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,270
the president and is like orchestrating this whole thing.

250
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,309
You know, the dark haired lady.

251
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,549
-- Oh, I don't think she's,
-- does

252
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:42,109
-- she
-- not have, yeah,

253
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:42,869
maybe she doesn't have a name.

254
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:43,989
She has a name

255
00:10:44,229 --> 00:10:47,419
but she's the actual attacker. She's the one that engineered this whole thing.

256
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:50,429
The Volga are just the tool, right? They're just following the paperwork.

257
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,869
Like literally, you know, there's a destruction order that

258
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,820
-- Zao signed off on. Ok.
-- But, but regardless of who sent them,

259
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,489
the point is that the earth cannot stop the votes

260
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,200
no matter what they do.

261
00:11:02,469 --> 00:11:06,669
And basically, unless you are in another A PT organization,

262
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:09,739
you cannot stop these people no matter what you do.

263
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,520
Oh, you're going to have some employee that'll take a $10,000 bribe.

264
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:15,359
That, that's my whole point. Right. That is the point is

265
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,830
anyone who has a PT is part of their threat model. Like

266
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:20,119
that's ridiculous.

267
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,849
It's like saying that, that, you know,

268
00:11:21,859 --> 00:11:23,679
aliens attacking us is part of your threat

269
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,530
model and you're going to defend against it.

270
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:27,690
I think you can have it as part of your threat model.

271
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,229
But maybe you either assume the risk or for example,

272
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:31,760
you have compensating measures like,

273
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,690
oh we're just going to log the heck out of everything.

274
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,429
So in hindsight, we can figure out what happened or, you know,

275
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,559
roll back transactions if needed,

276
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,630
you know, or chase the money down or whatever, right?

277
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,390
You know, banks are a good example of that, right? You can attack banks

278
00:11:44,609 --> 00:11:48,260
and in many cases they have been attacked and compromised and then they just,

279
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:52,250
you know, basically, like claw back the money, you know, undo like

280
00:11:52,369 --> 00:11:53,710
a great example, Ethereum,

281
00:11:53,719 --> 00:11:57,309
they had that situation where a guy found a flaw and like scored several.

282
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,390
Was it millions or tens of millions of dollars? It

283
00:11:59,945 --> 00:12:02,726
and they just essentially went. Yep. No Mulligan do over.

284
00:12:02,736 --> 00:12:05,125
Yeah, we promised we'd never do this

285
00:12:05,245 --> 00:12:08,286
but we're doing it revoking transactions or whatever.

286
00:12:08,296 --> 00:12:09,926
And I think even more to the point though, it's,

287
00:12:09,935 --> 00:12:13,125
it's the whole point of the bypasses is like, why do we do?

288
00:12:13,135 --> 00:12:14,546
Security? Security has to be done.

289
00:12:14,556 --> 00:12:18,005
You have to build security into your product and your process and your company.

290
00:12:18,015 --> 00:12:19,075
That's true.

291
00:12:19,216 --> 00:12:23,742
That's so true. You got to build bypasses. This bypass is going to be built.

292
00:12:23,752 --> 00:12:27,341
How many places actually, like if you literally went up to them and said, like,

293
00:12:27,432 --> 00:12:28,961
why are you doing security?

294
00:12:28,971 --> 00:12:31,262
You would have a sensible answer other than like, well,

295
00:12:31,271 --> 00:12:36,351
because we have to or PCI compliance or, you know, some other form of because,

296
00:12:36,531 --> 00:12:40,861
yeah, and you know, actually that's one thing that I talk about a lot is

297
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,179
compliance is a reasonable driver of security.

298
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:48,299
There's nothing to be ashamed of to say. I'm only doing this for compliance.

299
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,539
Well, and like, as a vendor, for example, we have to do security otherwise, you know,

300
00:12:51,549 --> 00:12:52,859
people will buy our products.

301
00:12:52,869 --> 00:12:57,140
-- That's the whole
-- point, right? Is when I'm writing up security features

302
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,380
for products,

303
00:12:58,729 --> 00:13:00,869
I will, I mean, I'm, I'm quite clear, I'm like, look,

304
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,200
we're doing this for compliance.

305
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,940
There's no other reason this isn't about goodwill.

306
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,260
This isn't about because it's the right thing to do what, blah, blah, no compliance.

307
00:13:07,489 --> 00:13:10,020
We're doing it because compliance and then people relate to that though too.

308
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,859
They're like, all right, we have to do this because if we don't,

309
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,599
you know, people can't buy a product

310
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,460
and that makes sense whereas it's like, ok,

311
00:13:15,469 --> 00:13:17,049
uh this is hard to do and I don't want to

312
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:19,330
do it and it's really just for the good of humanity.

313
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,710
So let's put that down farther on the list. Right?

314
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,109
I mean, that's what happens.

315
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:25,989
Well, that's what gets me with the whole a PT thing, right?

316
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,309
Like by definition, you look at any piece of software,

317
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,409
they all have security flaws, they all have new security flaws, by definition,

318
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:32,760
any piece of software you look at

319
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,460
is going to have security flaws,

320
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:35,380
you know,

321
00:13:35,489 --> 00:13:38,179
and what gets me is like, even like really dumb stuff,

322
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,630
like you should probably remove code that is no longer active.

323
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,760
Like that is one of the fundamentals of security coding, right?

324
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:47,729
Like get rid of dead code. And I mean, even open SSH got this wrong.

325
00:13:48,739 --> 00:13:48,760
I

326
00:13:48,989 --> 00:13:49,109
know

327
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:50,450
and to the point of disclosure,

328
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:54,380
like that's like they literally made a rookie mistake that resulted in a terrible,

329
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,210
terrible flaw.

330
00:13:55,219 --> 00:13:55,760
I know, I

331
00:13:55,909 --> 00:13:57,229
know. All right. Anyway, no, let's keep going.

332
00:13:57,239 --> 00:14:00,820
Do you have any notes before we move on from this section?

333
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:04,380
Well, just, yeah, that sort of that whole security notification process

334
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:06,429
and you know what it really reminds me of is like,

335
00:14:07,409 --> 00:14:08,880
they, well, in this case,

336
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,359
they sort of intentionally made the notification process difficult.

337
00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:14,510
So nobody would kick up a fuss, but like how many vendors do that?

338
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,460
And it just costs everybody like

339
00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:19,349
an enormous amount of pain. Like that's one thing I love

340
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:20,849
with the open source world is, you know,

341
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:23,250
we're going to be moving to a model where every single

342
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,349
flaw hopefully in the open source world gets a CV and

343
00:14:26,859 --> 00:14:30,820
that CV gets published in the official, you know, CV, database of miter,

344
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:31,440
like

345
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,020
the second or the minute or the hour it goes public either, like,

346
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,919
if it's public to begin with or, you know, once it's an embargoed.

347
00:14:37,929 --> 00:14:40,320
So that, that notification thing

348
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,320
is trivial. You know,

349
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:44,719
and especially, like, because I just,

350
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:49,719
I know what people spend and how much time and effort it takes now to, like, monitor

351
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,640
all of these open source providers for security updates and stuff.

352
00:14:52,969 --> 00:14:55,080
Oh, man, it's bonkers. Absolutely.

353
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,250
You know, like when I found out like, one of the firms I was working at charge, like,

354
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,330
you know, $250,000 a year for a basic threat feed.

355
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,520
I'm like, well, you know, wait a minute.

356
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,510
That's like two full time people, two full time people can monitor all of this.

357
00:15:07,219 --> 00:15:09,929
We're talking thousands of projects now, you know,

358
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,989
probably a core of several 100 that really matter everywhere.

359
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,710
But I mean, yeah, these things are, you know, and there's a, like you look at the,

360
00:15:16,719 --> 00:15:19,159
well, the Linux kernel is always my favorite because it's like, you know,

361
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:21,270
can you imagine reading every commit,

362
00:15:21,409 --> 00:15:24,849
-- how big of a team you would need? Uh,
-- one really smart person could do it

363
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,289
descent.

364
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:28,739
I know it's complicated. It's

365
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,750
-- complicated, you know.
-- That's, and anyways, yeah.

366
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,299
So, I mean, it's, I just, I wish people would have more transparency and more,

367
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:37,880
you know, better data structured, data collected data, you know,

368
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,320
that, that whole data curation piece really needs to happen more.

369
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:43,239
It'll get there. It'll get there.

370
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:43,799
Well, we,

371
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:48,239
no one's really in charge of that and I think you pushing with the DWF will have

372
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,429
hopefully

373
00:15:49,539 --> 00:15:51,669
some fantastic outcomes. All right.

374
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:53,950
So the, the one other thing I want to point out in,

375
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:58,700
in the beginning when Arthur is at the party talking to Trillion for the first time,

376
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,750
they have a record player there and he bumps it out of the way.

377
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,890
Like who freaking uses record players at parties. Come on, guys.

378
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:05,109
That's not believable.

379
00:16:05,419 --> 00:16:06,010
I don't know.

380
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,390
-- No sales were
-- up, not in 2005.

381
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:11,289
Like,

382
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:15,580
-- well, true. Yeah, I was definitely going down the toilet then
-- I don't believe it.

383
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,719
No way. I don't believe it.

384
00:16:16,729 --> 00:16:19,119
But I mean, it's just one of those movie tropes, you know, I don't

385
00:16:19,219 --> 00:16:20,960
know, it's a guy at a party

386
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:24,919
bumps the record just as he says, something incredibly rude and obnoxious.

387
00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:28,479
It's a plot vehicle. I understand that I'm just saying. Anyway.

388
00:16:28,585 --> 00:16:30,525
-- Anyway. Oh
-- one minor point.

389
00:16:30,534 --> 00:16:33,205
So like do you have a plan for the end of the world or even a

390
00:16:33,215 --> 00:16:36,674
plan to deal with your house being knocked down or can you even find your towel?

391
00:16:36,684 --> 00:16:39,465
Right. Most people can't even find their towel, let alone have a plan.

392
00:16:39,575 --> 00:16:43,085
Look, if my house gets knocked down, like whatever,

393
00:16:43,094 --> 00:16:45,364
the least of my worries is gonna be

394
00:16:45,664 --> 00:16:46,565
anything

395
00:16:46,695 --> 00:16:48,804
but the horrific event that caused that to happen,

396
00:16:48,815 --> 00:16:51,434
which will probably be something outside of the realm of sanity.

397
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:53,304
Funny story.

398
00:16:53,315 --> 00:16:56,905
Housing demolition companies have been known to get the address wrong. They do.

399
00:16:56,914 --> 00:16:57,385
I know.

400
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,580
And you google that and it's like, are you kidding me? Like,

401
00:17:01,109 --> 00:17:04,130
uh, but I guess, you know, you're a housing and, and these guys literally are like,

402
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,780
yeah, we started knocking down the house and then we noticed it was full of stuff but,

403
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,900
you know, whatever

404
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,180
we have the paperwork.

405
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:11,910
I know. But

406
00:17:12,368 --> 00:17:16,218
ok, you actually bring up a great point is, do I have a plan for my husband?

407
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:19,269
And I don't know why would I me spending time

408
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:22,078
on that is ridiculous because the odds of it actually,

409
00:17:22,088 --> 00:17:22,308
I mean,

410
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:24,038
I might as well plan for winning the lottery

411
00:17:24,048 --> 00:17:27,259
because I suspect there are two very similar events.

412
00:17:27,398 --> 00:17:28,088
Granted,

413
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:30,948
I know there are people who plan what they're going to do when they win the lottery,

414
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,338
but practically speaking, like they're wasting their time too,

415
00:17:33,348 --> 00:17:35,359
although their time doesn't have a lot of value, I imagine.

416
00:17:35,369 --> 00:17:37,688
So, they're probably not wasting very much

417
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:41,999
and, and security falls into this trap is we have to plan

418
00:17:42,819 --> 00:17:45,239
things that matter in ways that matter.

419
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,319
Because if you're doing pie in the sky security planning,

420
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,000
you're wasting your time.

421
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,599
And when you're at a, at a, you know, at a company, you're wasting money.

422
00:17:53,609 --> 00:17:55,199
If you're wasting time, let's face it.

423
00:17:55,859 --> 00:17:57,199
Well, yeah, it comes back to that whole, you know,

424
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:00,390
why are you doing security and most places are not going to present, you know,

425
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,089
a report with, you know, what we're putting in, what we're getting out, what the,

426
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:06,239
you know, expected return on investment is

427
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,640
most don't even know. Let's face it. Most of them have no idea.

428
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:13,349
I mean, that's the reality of it anyway. Anyway, let's keep going. All right.

429
00:18:13,369 --> 00:18:14,880
They get out of the heart of gold.

430
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,959
And do you know what the first thing I realized

431
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,160
when I started watching that scene this time?

432
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:23,079
And I guess, I don't remember this from the last time I watched it is

433
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,719
they say the letter Z

434
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,000
instead of Z

435
00:18:27,829 --> 00:18:32,780
because in all the other media I've consumed on hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy is,

436
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:33,670
it's

437
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,469
right. It's on

438
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:38,839
ZZ nine plural Z alpha, which is the,

439
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,119
the, I guess coordinates of the earth

440
00:18:41,699 --> 00:18:43,260
in the Hitchhiker's Universe.

441
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,699
But because this was a Hollywood movie, they say ZZ nine

442
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:47,180
Z

443
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:50,599
alpha. And I remember I'm watching it. I'm thinking this is crazy.

444
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:52,260
They don't say Z, they say Z.

445
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,650
So, yeah, that's funny.

446
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,560
-- I'm not totally not security related but,
-- oh,

447
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:59,619
actually I do have one thing going back to the beginning but here's the thing,

448
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:00,270
it's not so much.

449
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,280
Do you have a plan if all the dolphins vanish? But would you even notice?

450
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:06,569
I would not notice because I don't live anywhere near the water?

451
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,910
Well, and by that, I mean, like, you know, how many times have there been like

452
00:19:10,239 --> 00:19:11,859
situations where people are like, oh, yeah,

453
00:19:11,869 --> 00:19:14,739
the ids or the IDP went silent like a week ago.

454
00:19:14,849 --> 00:19:17,209
-- It happens all
-- the time.

455
00:19:17,219 --> 00:19:17,660
Yeah.

456
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:18,650
Yes.

457
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,630
-- You know,
-- I, I feel like that should maybe be something people, like,

458
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,790
-- check into
-- people shouldn't do this.

459
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,709
You should have a system in place capable of finding these problems.

460
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:29,989
Like, if the I DS doesn't check in for an hour, you know,

461
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,420
something's wrong and you should be triggering emails

462
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,800
and text messages telling someone something is broken

463
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,660
yet people can't do that.

464
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:37,660
It has to be a

465
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:38,229
chance.

466
00:19:38,459 --> 00:19:38,829
So anyway,

467
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:43,209
the other thing I loved about the heart of gold is the knife that makes toast.

468
00:19:43,699 --> 00:19:44,219
How did they get that?

469
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:44,359
A

470
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,589
TS A man likes,

471
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:49,729
well, the concern I have though is one side of your toast would be nice and well,

472
00:19:49,739 --> 00:19:52,089
toasty hot and the other side would be cold.

473
00:19:52,099 --> 00:19:55,680
You'd have to cut a slice and then discard the cold piece

474
00:19:55,689 --> 00:19:59,089
and then cut a new slice and then you'd have two very warm

475
00:19:59,189 --> 00:20:00,979
sides of one piece of toast.

476
00:20:00,989 --> 00:20:04,219
-- So
-- it needs to be like sort of like the Dolf Mall, the Darth Maul Saber,

477
00:20:04,229 --> 00:20:05,729
like where it needs to be like two knives.

478
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,369
So when you cut it, you get both sides nice and warm and toasted. But on the flip side,

479
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:13,369
here's the cool thing for making peanut butter sandwiches.

480
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,170
You would have the side that's cold that you could put peanut butter on and

481
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,750
the side that's hot that like you could hold and put in your mouth.

482
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,030
So you get that like still nicely toasted bread, warmth thing going on.

483
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,290
But without that nasty melted peanut butter.

484
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,020
Ok.

485
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:28,060
Have you not ever put peanut butter on a hot piece of toast where

486
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:31,979
it gets instantly super gross and runny and like dribbles out the side.

487
00:20:32,069 --> 00:20:35,040
I have a handful of, we say

488
00:20:35,209 --> 00:20:36,900
personality quirks

489
00:20:37,339 --> 00:20:37,900
and

490
00:20:38,229 --> 00:20:42,989
one of my personality quirks is that I refuse to eat peanut butter on toast.

491
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,890
And I have never had peanut butter on toast. And the idea of eating it revolts me.

492
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,949
So I will never eat peanut butter on toast.

493
00:20:48,979 --> 00:20:51,310
-- Would
-- you eat peanut butter on bread on toast? I love

494
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:52,170
it. I love it on bread.

495
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,849
I eat it in cracker skirt. I eat it with pretzels.

496
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:59,359
But for some isn't like my, my brain will not let me eat peanut butter on toast.

497
00:20:59,369 --> 00:21:02,050
See, now, if I want to feed I wanna like, now II, I,

498
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:06,239
this is terrible to admit to but now I'm imagining some sort of like

499
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:10,189
saw movie plot that involves you eating the toast with peanut butter on it.

500
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,599
-- Yes.
-- That doesn't sound weird at all

501
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,930
anyway. No, I, I don't know.

502
00:21:15,939 --> 00:21:19,630
I've never put peanut butter on warm toast and, and I never will.

503
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,689
Well, because it gets running and it just, it dribbles out and it's a pain in the butt.

504
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:28,630
I, I can imagine that. Iw peanut warm peanut butter it melts regardless.

505
00:21:28,959 --> 00:21:30,150
You're talking about peanut butter.

506
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,270
I'm, I'm complaining about the TS A, letting me take my toaster knife on it.

507
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:38,060
-- Well, but it's a private, it's a private aircraft or spacecraft.
-- Yeah, I guess it is.

508
00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:40,339
That's true. Well, was it who owned it?

509
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:42,109
Well, the government, but

510
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:45,229
it wasn't like a public transport thing. It was.

511
00:21:45,829 --> 00:21:50,890
Yeah. Well, yeah, I guess it's true because you figure if you got, say a naval vessel,

512
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:53,030
I'm sure they aren't running all the,

513
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:57,349
the sailors through a metal detector on their way on and off the ship.

514
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:01,189
Well, I've actually read funny stories where, for example,

515
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:04,310
where military units are being transported with all their gear.

516
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,869
And so these guys are carrying, you know, granted,

517
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,260
they don't have the ammunition with them.

518
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:11,219
They're carrying things like, you know, bayonets and knives

519
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,939
but, and they were literally

520
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:15,420
confiscating like fingernail clippers.

521
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:18,780
This is way back in the day, like right after 911 when things were kind of insane.

522
00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:20,140
-- That's
-- all Vogons.

523
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:21,180
Basically,

524
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,380
you have your insane list of rules and you're going to follow them no matter what.

525
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:29,750
And it doesn't have to make sense. You're just going to follow the rules and

526
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,329
I mean, unfortunately when you end up in security situations,

527
00:22:33,339 --> 00:22:37,050
that's what happens because it's dangerous and if you screw up, you're like,

528
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:37,819
I followed the rules.

529
00:22:37,829 --> 00:22:38,530
Now, I felt well,

530
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,000
but I also wonder because sometimes you can't tell people why the rule exists.

531
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,609
Like that whole laptop thing in the Middle East

532
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:44,689
on the airlines that we discussed last episode.

533
00:22:44,699 --> 00:22:45,099
Right. Like,

534
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,349
they can't tell us kind of,

535
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:50,910
or apparently they can't tell us what the real reason of it,

536
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,920
you know, for a variety of security reasons, you know,

537
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,520
maybe they don't want to disclose the source or whatever.

538
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:56,969
Ok. Yes. But let's face it.

539
00:22:56,979 --> 00:23:00,550
If you have soldiers bringing real weapons onto

540
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,930
airplanes and you take away their fingernail clippers,

541
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,959
you're a fool for real.

542
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,150
Well, they don't need a nail clippers. They have a bayonet,

543
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:08,959
I mean.

544
00:23:09,109 --> 00:23:11,319
Right. But anyway, anyway, whatever

545
00:23:11,459 --> 00:23:16,160
it is what it is. Uh, the other thing I loved from kind of that, that whole scene

546
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,040
is the heart of gold flees the

547
00:23:19,219 --> 00:23:20,079
Bogans chasing them

548
00:23:20,229 --> 00:23:24,589
and one of the Vogons says, bring me the request to pursue fugitive form.

549
00:23:24,699 --> 00:23:29,510
And I was like that, that is so great. I love the obscene bureaucracy.

550
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,140
They give the Bogans and that's the one thing

551
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,319
actually in the movie I think they did really well

552
00:23:33,439 --> 00:23:37,599
is the Bogans are way more bureaucratic in the movie than they are in the,

553
00:23:37,935 --> 00:23:38,675
the radio show.

554
00:23:38,694 --> 00:23:38,974
Well,

555
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:43,785
and see that leads actually to sort of one of the questions or points I have where,

556
00:23:43,805 --> 00:23:47,074
you know, they actually have a process in place for that.

557
00:23:48,074 --> 00:23:48,435
You're like, no,

558
00:23:48,724 --> 00:23:49,064
think about it.

559
00:23:49,525 --> 00:23:50,505
-- Ok.
-- No, no, but

560
00:23:50,655 --> 00:23:52,515
it's a, it's a made up story

561
00:23:52,645 --> 00:23:56,994
and obviously they just make the Bogans overly bureaucratic in every possible way.

562
00:23:57,005 --> 00:23:59,354
I mean, it's like later on when they're trying to free Trillion

563
00:23:59,635 --> 00:24:00,425
and they bring

564
00:24:00,535 --> 00:24:02,685
the the regular prisoner release form and

565
00:24:02,694 --> 00:24:04,474
they needed the presidential prison release form,

566
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,234
which is blue.

567
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,349
Yeah, which they actually have a copy of, I mean,

568
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:10,729
a specific note of that but that small office,

569
00:24:10,739 --> 00:24:16,449
-- of course they do because it's a made up show man
-- as much as you can hate on the Vogons.

570
00:24:16,459 --> 00:24:21,229
They did think through like pretty much every eventuality and have a form for it

571
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:26,449
except where Arthur goes to get the document, there's like 12 slots, right?

572
00:24:26,459 --> 00:24:30,699
They clearly whatever, it's a movie, right? It's fun. It's fun and funny.

573
00:24:30,709 --> 00:24:35,250
And, and anyway, the so, so also the next thing I'm going to bring up is is 42

574
00:24:35,709 --> 00:24:36,369
where

575
00:24:36,699 --> 00:24:41,180
I, I realize watching this when they cut to the scene where they show deep thought,

576
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:45,729
give the answer of 42 is the answer of 42 is technically correct

577
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,569
because they asked a question and deep thought,

578
00:24:48,579 --> 00:24:50,589
gave them the answer to their question.

579
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:52,890
They didn't ask a question so much.

580
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,670
They did ask a question, they asked the wrong question

581
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,540
-- and well, they asked an overly broad question.
-- But here's my point is

582
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,050
people come to security folks like us,

583
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,650
they ask these questions

584
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,479
and,

585
00:25:04,709 --> 00:25:07,839
and I now I'll say these days I try really

586
00:25:07,849 --> 00:25:10,380
hard to ask follow up questions and be helpful.

587
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,069
But I remember there was a day when I would give them the answer.

588
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:15,930
That was technically correct. It wasn't useful in any way

589
00:25:16,089 --> 00:25:18,660
and they were usually too embarrassed to ask a follow up question or

590
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:21,449
ask for proper help and they'd leave and I knew they'd leave,

591
00:25:21,459 --> 00:25:22,449
which is why I did that.

592
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,619
And I think that's very common

593
00:25:24,829 --> 00:25:26,900
in, I mean, in the computer industry in general,

594
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:30,540
but especially in security or we're, we're technically correct all the time.

595
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:34,829
-- It's not helpful.
-- But, well, it's true of any technical field.

596
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:38,839
Is that the correct technical answer also has a lot of nuance typically.

597
00:25:39,089 --> 00:25:40,699
Yeah, I mean, ok, that's fair.

598
00:25:40,709 --> 00:25:45,380
And if you don't have a really, if you don't have that deep knowledge,

599
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:46,819
you don't get that nuance.

600
00:25:47,189 --> 00:25:48,599
That is true. I

601
00:25:48,699 --> 00:25:49,030
won't just

602
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,550
-- with that. So,
-- you know, I do the same thing too.

603
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,250
Now where somebody asks me a question, I'm like, wait, what, what, like,

604
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,540
what's really going on?

605
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,530
Like, what are you really trying to ask? Like, what's the problem?

606
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:01,890
Yeah, like I hear the question you formulated, but I've heard that question before.

607
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,719
I know how this conversation ends.

608
00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:05,189
So let's try something different.

609
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:05,719
You know, actually, you know,

610
00:26:05,729 --> 00:26:07,689
it's really funny as I'm having a lot of conversations

611
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,959
like that now where I'll talk to certain customers,

612
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:10,729
I went down and they'll say

613
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:11,449
I need Kose

614
00:26:11,819 --> 00:26:12,489
authentication.

615
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,189
And the first thing I say is Kerberos

616
00:26:14,459 --> 00:26:18,349
is rarely the right answer to any question. What are you actually trying to do.

617
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:20,069
And it turns out they need active directory

618
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,849
support and they found out like it works with

619
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,449
Kerberos.

620
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:24,790
I'm like, ok, there's better ways to do this. Like

621
00:26:24,979 --> 00:26:28,400
Kerberos is terrible if we don't want to use that, if we can avoid it.

622
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:30,550
That and that's one of the things I love.

623
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,790
So, going back a bit, you know,

624
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,859
is the whole hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy book because

625
00:26:34,949 --> 00:26:36,800
sort of skip them going on to the Vogon ship.

626
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:38,709
-- I think we should cover that a bit.
-- Is there anything?

627
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,369
But the thing is in the movie, they basically show up.

628
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:41,729
Well,

629
00:26:41,739 --> 00:26:43,430
the fact that they pick up Hitchhikers and don't

630
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:45,170
know they have people who boarded the ship.

631
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,150
Well, they don't though the Drei

632
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,239
did it in, in the book and the radio show,

633
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:52,369
but they don't like they cover nothing of value in the movie.

634
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,640
They, they get on the ship,

635
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,890
they get captured, the terrible poetry is read to them.

636
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:00,310
And in effect, even on the, once you see the Vogon,

637
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,300
he's sitting on the deer that the Vogons said, I forget the name of it.

638
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,729
He's crushing the crabs

639
00:27:04,969 --> 00:27:07,880
and there is zero explanation of that in the movie.

640
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:10,949
But if you obviously read the book, you understand that what happened on

641
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,109
Boere is the Vogons of all first and the planet felt bad and made

642
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:17,680
all these beautiful other creatures that the Vogons just continue to murder and,

643
00:27:17,689 --> 00:27:19,800
and kill because that's what they do.

644
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:23,000
But anyways, the, the thing I love about his Checkers guide to the galaxy

645
00:27:23,369 --> 00:27:24,869
is, do you remember why

646
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:25,979
it sold so well?

647
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:30,109
Because it is slightly cheaper than the, the encyclopedia Galactica.

648
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:34,589
And it has the word don't panic written in large friendly letters on the cover.

649
00:27:34,829 --> 00:27:40,390
Exactly. So it's not as technically correct, but it's actually somewhat useful.

650
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,229
It, it's not useful. It just is cheaper and has don't panic written on the cover,

651
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:46,260
which in fact Arthur says at one point,

652
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,380
that's the first useful thing anyone said all day.

653
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,260
Exactly.

654
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:52,709
Like, how often have we been in security situations where like,

655
00:27:52,719 --> 00:27:54,839
literally the first thing is like, don't panic.

656
00:27:54,849 --> 00:27:57,859
-- Uh
-- You know what's really funny about that is a million years ago,

657
00:27:57,869 --> 00:27:59,640
one of the first jobs they ever had,

658
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:03,560
I worked with this guy who was, I mean, he was an old dude and this was in the,

659
00:28:03,569 --> 00:28:05,250
the mid to early nineties

660
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:08,739
and this guy was already fairly old. So, like, he'd, he'd been around

661
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,010
and I'll never forget that like,

662
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:14,300
a server would crash or the network would go down or something crazy would go on

663
00:28:14,449 --> 00:28:16,229
and I'd like, run into his office and be like,

664
00:28:16,439 --> 00:28:17,609
hey, Pete, like bla bla bla,

665
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,609
you know, he'd be like, hey, dude, sit in that chair right there.

666
00:28:20,619 --> 00:28:21,890
You just need to chill out for a minute.

667
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,969
I'm like, but, but yeah, I mean, nothing working and he's like, it's OK,

668
00:28:24,979 --> 00:28:27,609
we could sit here for two minutes and nothing's gonna break.

669
00:28:27,619 --> 00:28:30,369
And I'm like, it's already broke and it's like, then it's fine. Right.

670
00:28:30,719 --> 00:28:33,650
And I remember at the time I'm like, this, this old guy is crazy,

671
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:34,750
but now

672
00:28:34,939 --> 00:28:35,489
I'm like,

673
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:36,569
he got it.

674
00:28:36,579 --> 00:28:40,630
Like, you can't, if you panic, you fail, like, period, you end up like,

675
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,030
deleting the whole file server because you went crazy and type the wrong thing.

676
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,989
Well, like that, that classic, uh, what was it?

677
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,829
Git lab where they, like, just, they had a small problem and they made it much,

678
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:52,469
-- much worse
-- where they deleted all of their,

679
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:56,030
-- their data
-- and thank God they happened to have a snapshot,

680
00:28:56,310 --> 00:29:00,115
right? That was a few hours old. Otherwise they would have lost like a day or two.

681
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:04,365
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah. That's crazy. It happens though, man. I mean, I get it right.

682
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,605
I get why it happens anyway.

683
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:11,225
Oh, well, 11 thing that was never really covered in the book or anywhere was so,

684
00:29:11,235 --> 00:29:13,095
apparently the Vogons are immune to Vogan

685
00:29:13,306 --> 00:29:15,845
-- poetry.
-- They write the Bogan poetry.

686
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:18,975
Well, I could get the author not being affected by it but other Vogons,

687
00:29:18,985 --> 00:29:21,916
other Vogons are unsympathetic bureaucratic creatures.

688
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,125
Why would they be affected by

689
00:29:23,432 --> 00:29:25,261
poetry? They probably enjoy it.

690
00:29:25,302 --> 00:29:28,092
So, I guess, uh, what that kind of leads to is, I mean,

691
00:29:28,102 --> 00:29:30,332
do we have any security measures that we

692
00:29:30,342 --> 00:29:32,362
can use to essentially punish bad guys or make

693
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:34,832
their lives more miserable that we are immune

694
00:29:34,842 --> 00:29:37,291
to because every time I've seen a security measure

695
00:29:37,472 --> 00:29:39,942
they almost always involve some trade off of usability.

696
00:29:39,952 --> 00:29:41,462
I mean, there's that classic thing of, you know,

697
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:45,901
like you have to have tradeoffs for security. I mean, that's the old trope.

698
00:29:46,092 --> 00:29:46,421
Right.

699
00:29:46,671 --> 00:29:47,741
No, no, no,

700
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:51,729
-- there are no tradeoffs. Security loses, end of story.
-- Well, exactly. Right.

701
00:29:51,739 --> 00:29:53,150
And that's the thing, you know, so,

702
00:29:53,729 --> 00:29:56,689
you know, that old trope of, well, you can't have security without, you know,

703
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:59,890
somehow making it just horrible for people to use this, you know,

704
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,280
which doesn't work.

705
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:04,229
I'm just, yeah, I kind of was thinking about that, you know, what can we do

706
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,819
to make security better?

707
00:30:05,829 --> 00:30:09,060
-- That doesn't, you know, hurt anybody other than the bad guys
-- today.

708
00:30:09,069 --> 00:30:10,229
I don't think we can answer that.

709
00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:13,000
Well, a great example would be like re listing for email servers,

710
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:16,069
right where it's just, I'm going to delay you sending the email by a few minutes

711
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:18,660
because a legit email server will then retry.

712
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:21,209
But like a spammer won't, the spammer is just moving on.

713
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:22,739
-- But
-- that stopped the spammers for a while.

714
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:26,489
But now the spammers just use like legitimate mail servers to send the mail.

715
00:30:26,869 --> 00:30:28,010
-- They got around it.
-- Right.

716
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:30,630
-- You know,
-- but that, that cut down on the drive bys.

717
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,130
It did.

718
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,430
Oh, it did. And it was hugely effective at one point.

719
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:35,660
And I remember when the gray listing stopped working is when

720
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,849
I stopped running my own mail server because I thought there's,

721
00:30:37,859 --> 00:30:40,329
I, I give up like you win, spammers, you win.

722
00:30:40,699 --> 00:30:43,650
So this is the end of part one of episode 42.

723
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,079
It's quite long, so I decided to split it in half.

724
00:30:46,089 --> 00:30:49,199
So thanks for listening and I will see you all next week.
