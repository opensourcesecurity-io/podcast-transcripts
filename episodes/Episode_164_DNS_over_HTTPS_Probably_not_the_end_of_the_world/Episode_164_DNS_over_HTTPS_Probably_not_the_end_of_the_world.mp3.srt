Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 164 with myself,

1
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,220
Kurt Siefried

2
00:00:11,399 --> 00:00:12,989
and my partner in Thought Crime. Josh

3
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:18,229
Reser. Uh What's new man? Just uh it's fall and kind of enjoying the leaves turning.

4
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,120
It's nice.

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,079
That means they fall down and I have to rake them though.

6
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,389
And I don't want to actually, I need to buy a rake. Thank you for saying

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,370
mine just broke.

8
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:28,360
I was

9
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:30,090
gonna say, how do you not own a rake?

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,470
Like no, no, I had one and I was,

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,380
I don't even remember what I was raking at this point but it, it like broke,

12
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:38,770
it was a metal rake in the end, just kind of broke off.

13
00:00:38,779 --> 00:00:40,849
It was, it was old. So it's not like it was defective,

14
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,799
but I need a new one because my, my other rake actually, I have no rakes now. So

15
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:46,930
anyway. All right.

16
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:51,959
That is irrelevant to this podcast. I just mow my lawn and mulch it, well, you can't,

17
00:00:52,209 --> 00:00:56,090
all the leaves. Do you have one tree that barely has leaves on it or

18
00:00:56,509 --> 00:01:01,340
uh mostly I have conifers? Yeah, I have a thick, that's pine trees for you.

19
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:02,250
You uncivilized.

20
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:04,529
So, yeah, pine needles.

21
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:09,169
But, um, yeah, I only have one or two trees that shed all their leaves. But yeah, so,

22
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,169
no, the last place I lived, I had two giant maple trees

23
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,309
and, um, I could regularly like,

24
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,010
and this is filling trash bags and stomping them down.

25
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,146
I would average about 3035 trash bags of leaves

26
00:01:20,765 --> 00:01:25,045
in the fall, which, I mean, it was a gloriously huge pile like my kids loved it.

27
00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:28,646
I'm familiar with this problem because it is the problem I have.

28
00:01:29,185 --> 00:01:32,875
And so yes, mulching my lawn is definitely out of the question.

29
00:01:32,896 --> 00:01:39,286
You need a flamethrower or I need like slave Children, labor people, which I have.

30
00:01:39,435 --> 00:01:42,875
Although they're not, they're not the best rakers in the world. So they do need a

31
00:01:42,982 --> 00:01:44,902
of prodding while they're working. But

32
00:01:45,012 --> 00:01:50,561
anyway, anyway. All right, man. Uh, DNS over http S friend

33
00:01:50,732 --> 00:01:50,842
or foe.

34
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:55,421
Yes. Come on. That's not, that's not interesting. Ok, so

35
00:01:55,641 --> 00:01:57,722
I'm going to go back and quote myself.

36
00:01:57,732 --> 00:02:02,361
If your security relies on you behaving like a Nation State attacker,

37
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,001
you're going to have a bad time, long term.

38
00:02:04,022 --> 00:02:06,041
What? That doesn't? That's not an answer.

39
00:02:06,491 --> 00:02:08,640
Yeah, so I'm ok with DNS over http

40
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:11,320
because that will help foil Nation State Attackers.

41
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,759
And if that makes somebody else's life a little more difficult.

42
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:15,320
Well, ok, sorry,

43
00:02:15,779 --> 00:02:16,970
that's kind of too bad

44
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,039
because here's the thing fundamentally, if you legitimately need to secure

45
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,119
a device then you typically get to control it to some degree.

46
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,360
So for example, with a smartphone or a laptop, whatever,

47
00:02:27,369 --> 00:02:29,449
if you really are that paranoid,

48
00:02:29,669 --> 00:02:32,169
you can install endpoint security on it.

49
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:32,699
Right.

50
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:36,270
So this kind of, I mean, I get it though, the, the convenience of like, as a,

51
00:02:36,279 --> 00:02:38,949
for example, you know, parents are like, oh, I just want to like,

52
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:39,490
you know,

53
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,740
filter DNS so my kids can't get into the bad stuff

54
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,850
and it's just easy and convenient and you set your,

55
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,800
uh, you know, on your router,

56
00:02:44,809 --> 00:02:48,649
you set the DNS to point to trying to think of who provides these things.

57
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,580
I don't even know anymore.

58
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:53,139
I think open DNS has a service where you can say like I'm a parent,

59
00:02:53,149 --> 00:02:56,259
don't let my kids look at naughty things and your kids totally know

60
00:02:56,365 --> 00:02:59,085
to get around that, by the way, just fy I and,

61
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:02,184
or they just go to the local Starbucks where they don't filter internet or

62
00:03:02,195 --> 00:03:06,384
the library where they have computers with unfiltered or the neighbor's wi fi or,

63
00:03:06,494 --> 00:03:07,225
or whatever.

64
00:03:08,365 --> 00:03:09,274
So I

65
00:03:09,384 --> 00:03:11,774
get the convenience aspect because I like convenience because

66
00:03:11,785 --> 00:03:13,384
I'm a lazy person because I'm a person.

67
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,500
But

68
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,470
fundamentally the trade off,

69
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,550
I think between annoying some parents and whatnot and some businesses versus

70
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:25,070
making a whole big pile of people safer against nation state attacks.

71
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,460
And

72
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:26,639
more importantly,

73
00:03:26,649 --> 00:03:29,270
all those attacks that attack routers redirect their DNS

74
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:31,580
and then all sorts of nasty shenanigans happen.

75
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:32,419
So, I,

76
00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:35,820
I think overall DNS over http addresses a problem that

77
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,860
needs to be addressed and is a good thing.

78
00:03:38,089 --> 00:03:39,500
Yeah, I totally agree.

79
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:44,860
And I love that my ISP can't spy on any of the DNS traffic anymore that's happening.

80
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,429
Which is fantastic. I'm, I'm not even too worried about that.

81
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,820
I mean, well, because you were involved in that Twitter discussion about, you know,

82
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,589
the low bar versus the high bar of security and how, you know,

83
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,429
we need to raise the low bar for everybody, which I agree with.

84
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,509
We, we should do that. You know, we should make the world less sucky.

85
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,179
And this is one of those ways to do that.

86
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,509
You know, if a major part of my life is tied into Google and Apple's systems,

87
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,649
you know, all my email, all my personal data is in icloud and Google Drive

88
00:04:10,929 --> 00:04:12,389
full stop. It just is.

89
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,440
So, you know, when my computer is talking to Google,

90
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,880
I would feel a little bit less worried and I, you know,

91
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,709
much safer knowing that there's no

92
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,200
way for DNS shenanigans to happen

93
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,440
and for, you know,

94
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,549
my computer to actually be talking to something

95
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,380
in some other country that's not Google.

96
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,679
Uh, you know, I, I don't disagree with you. I think

97
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:34,399
it,

98
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,839
it amuses me a little bit watching the

99
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:41,010
arguments against this because I think they are weak

100
00:04:41,369 --> 00:04:43,480
and they often represent

101
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,640
a, I,

102
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:46,859
I would say a lack of understanding of

103
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,940
modern infrastructure is how I would describe it.

104
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,720
It's the old way of thinking and

105
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:52,899
the best part is fundamentally,

106
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,959
let's say you're using a VPN or whatever and you need access to magic DNS.

107
00:04:57,359 --> 00:04:59,260
You can, you can make that work.

108
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:01,640
It's not impossible to do.

109
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,579
Yeah, it might be an extra step or two.

110
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:06,000
But at the same time, if you're one of those people,

111
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,000
you already have such a unique setup,

112
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,910
adding one more step to it really isn't a big deal.

113
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,640
My only real concern honestly would be the argument where I

114
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:17,709
have IOT devices where I can't really control the end point.

115
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,160
And so I do need to do network level security for them.

116
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:23,559
That would be about the only real argument I can see because

117
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:27,880
I do own my IOT devices like I paid for them. But like,

118
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:31,230
you know, it's a binary blob that unless I reverse engineer it,

119
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:32,339
you know,

120
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,519
I have no idea what my skylink net security system

121
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:37,869
is doing unless I'm monitoring it on the network.

122
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,230
Yeah, but

123
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:44,040
it's not using DNS over hhps. It probably never will. So who cares?

124
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,029
Well, but you know, five years from now, right?

125
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,589
My light bulbs are doing it or whatever.

126
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,589
So, I mean that, like I said, that would be my only concern is where

127
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,630
people legitimately can't

128
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,950
get access to the end device.

129
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,089
And,

130
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,029
you know, for all the people that are like, well,

131
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,329
why don't you buy open source light bulbs.

132
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:01,040
Yeah. I mean,

133
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:02,309
yes, if

134
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:05,809
those even exist, I don't, I don't think they exist.

135
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,000
You know, I'm looking at my home security system and I'm looking at possibly

136
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,549
going with, um, the ring stuff or the nest stuff and again, it's like, proprietary.

137
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:16,850
Like, I don't know what it's doing and that's a trade off.

138
00:06:16,859 --> 00:06:18,200
I have to make because there is,

139
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:21,700
unless I construct a security system completely from scratch,

140
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:23,549
using a pile of like raspberry pies,

141
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,739
there's no way I'm going to have real visibility into it.

142
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,489
And so it boils down to, I have to trust

143
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,799
the manufacturer just like I do with my car. Right.

144
00:06:29,809 --> 00:06:31,290
I don't have the source code for my car.

145
00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:31,589
You know,

146
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,670
I just hope that those computer chips in their work and don't magically decide

147
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:38,609
to smash the gas pedal down when I'm putting it in a park.

148
00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:39,329
Right.

149
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,500
No, I, I don't know. I guess fundamentally I love it. People might not like it.

150
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,200
It's ok.

151
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,250
You'll get over it.

152
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:49,570
Well, how do I put this nicely? It's gonna happen whether they like it or not.

153
00:06:49,739 --> 00:06:52,049
No, it is. It's, it's pretty much game over.

154
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:54,809
I, I hate to argue that sort of, well,

155
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,570
it doesn't really matter what you think because they're doing it anyways.

156
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:00,420
So, your objections are duly noted and overruled.

157
00:07:00,429 --> 00:07:02,399
Google has to protect themselves and their

158
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,630
customers and Google has decided there's a,

159
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,040
you know,

160
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:08,790
there's a couple of ways they're doing this and one of the ways they're doing this is

161
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:11,720
encryption everywhere. All the things all the time, right?

162
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,579
Because like to go back in time,

163
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:14,649
their

164
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:15,380
Children,

165
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,869
there used to be a time when Google data

166
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,480
centers talk to each other over unencrypted links.

167
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:25,010
And then Google learned about the NSA and encrypted all their links. Yep. Yep.

168
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:25,630
That's right.

169
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:29,089
And I mean, man, I'll still, I will never forget this.

170
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,149
I have a memory burned in my brain forever is when SSH came out,

171
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,089
I talked to a friend and I said, doesn't this look neat?

172
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,070
And they said, why would anyone want that? We have talent?

173
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,869
I remember thinking,

174
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,040
I, I can't really argue with you today because

175
00:07:44,429 --> 00:07:44,730
man,

176
00:07:44,739 --> 00:07:48,079
in the middling a network was very difficult back then and

177
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:50,470
the number of people who could do it were small.

178
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,559
But at the same time, it's like

179
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,260
I know this is going to happen because it's better.

180
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,760
Well, ironically, man, in the middling networks, actually,

181
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:01,630
in some ways used to be really hard and really easy.

182
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,329
It was really easy in the sense of everything was hubs, not switches.

183
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:06,959
So, yeah, for those of you that don't know what a hub is.

184
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:09,260
So the way old timey network equipment worked is

185
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,070
you had a hub that you plug 10 computers into

186
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:13,890
and one computer would send a message and

187
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:15,779
the hub would basically replicate that message,

188
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,489
that electrical signal to the other

189
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,950
nine computers.

190
00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:23,290
And then basically, you know, it was up to your computer to ignore and,

191
00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:24,820
or listen to what it was supposed to.

192
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,609
And so

193
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:26,989
the funny thing is

194
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:30,510
the software to actually kind of listen to those messages or to redirect

195
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:33,808
stuff was really hard to get a hold of and remember Doug song.

196
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,500
He wrote SS A sniff and, and all that and I mean, I wrote an article about it

197
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:40,909
and, you know, I got death threats because people were so annoyed about this.

198
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,260
You know,

199
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,789
it used to actually in some ways be really hard to

200
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,789
do man in the middle because the software to do it

201
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:49,690
didn't exist like you, you would have to write it yourself and it required a pretty,

202
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,820
you had to be pretty knowledgeable about networking and operating systems

203
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:56,039
to write the software. And if you were though, it was not that hard,

204
00:08:56,309 --> 00:08:58,219
but the thing is kind of, here's the thing.

205
00:08:58,229 --> 00:09:01,099
Once one person writes the software and releases it on the internet,

206
00:09:01,429 --> 00:09:03,559
then kind of everybody has it. Right.

207
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:07,020
Well, in the bigger problem always wasn't even man in the middling,

208
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:10,530
it was just sniffing credentials because when you had hubs, I mean,

209
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,250
I remember doing this

210
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:14,140
in, on networks where

211
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,619
they, I mean, it was, it was like a party trick as well.

212
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,099
I went, I didn't go to good parties but,

213
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:20,809
you know, you'd tell someone log in, log in with T NE

214
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:21,909
and then you'd have,

215
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,849
it was, we call it Wire Shark.

216
00:09:23,859 --> 00:09:25,580
Now it was called Ethereal back then,

217
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,039
but you'd have it running and like you would print their password to the screen.

218
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:31,359
Like, how'd you do that? And I said you did it, you know, I didn't do anything.

219
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:35,820
I literally one time was uh trying to diagnose a pop log in like

220
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:41,030
a, an email login problem on one of the mail servers I was responsible for at an ISP.

221
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:45,070
And so I ran um TCP dump, you know, port 110.

222
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:46,669
Obviously,

223
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:47,919
I'm not going to bother passing at the

224
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:49,789
IP address and everything at the local machine.

225
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:55,719
And I'm like, and then II, I just traffic starts flying by and I'm like, right. Right.

226
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,479
Oh,

227
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:03,020
I have all the passwords now. Yeah. And it was, the ISP was using a hub. Good, good.

228
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,059
Well, that's good. Switches were expensive.

229
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,619
They were actually,

230
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,020
they, they actually were like 100 bucks support.

231
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,330
It was, yeah. Right. Exactly. 10 megabits.

232
00:10:11,469 --> 00:10:14,369
I remember getting a switch for the first time when

233
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,770
I was in college and I worked at the university

234
00:10:17,109 --> 00:10:19,650
and we had just this, this closet full of hubs.

235
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:23,330
It was an insane number of hubs for all of the, the sun workstations.

236
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,690
And we got switches and we got them at like cost and they were still really expensive.

237
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,929
I remember we plugged those suckers in and the first thing I did

238
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,489
was just start like moving some files around and it's like it's so fast

239
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:37,969
because I mean, so the problem was for, for you young uns who may not know

240
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:41,369
when you had a hub, there was a concept called the collision.

241
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,289
Only one person gets to talk at a time. Right. Exactly.

242
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:46,330
So, if two computers tried to talk at the same time,

243
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:48,859
you'd have a collision and then everyone stops and you

244
00:10:48,869 --> 00:10:50,450
back off and then you try again at a,

245
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,919
after a random interval, which is, this is all in the Ethernet spec,

246
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:54,909
you should read it sometime.

247
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:56,830
It's very exciting. And this works great

248
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,770
until you get to about 80% network utilization and then it falls off a cliff.

249
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:05,780
Exactly. And so if you're copying a huge file, it actually doesn't do a great job.

250
00:11:05,989 --> 00:11:09,510
It was very, very bad. Hey, but I mean, this was better. I had, um,

251
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,789
anyways, we're really deep into the old

252
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,549
stories. But

253
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,570
so basically, I, I like

254
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:19,469
anything that makes it harder for Nation States to attack people.

255
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:23,289
I think overall is a good thing. Any attack hurt. I mean, let's face it.

256
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:26,989
It screw Nation States, whatever those guys are. What do they know?

257
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,809
But I mean, for real, like anything. Well, but the thing to remember too is like

258
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:35,450
a lot of people now use networks that are really open to attack, you know,

259
00:11:35,614 --> 00:11:36,054
public Wi

260
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:39,744
fi. Oh, no, no, Kurt, we're security people. We should never connect to public

261
00:11:39,945 --> 00:11:42,215
wi fi. Well, see, this is what drives me nuts is all these people

262
00:11:42,315 --> 00:11:45,664
in security that spend all this time and effort securing their home network.

263
00:11:45,674 --> 00:11:47,835
And I'm like, cool. So, your home network is super secure.

264
00:11:47,844 --> 00:11:50,955
They're like, yeah, like, my laptop cannot be hacked from my home network, blah,

265
00:11:50,965 --> 00:11:51,275
blah, blah.

266
00:11:51,284 --> 00:11:53,864
And I'm like, cool. Like, you go to Starbucks, right? They're like, yeah.

267
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:54,945
And I'm like, so

268
00:11:55,289 --> 00:11:57,510
you bring your home network with you? How does that work?

269
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,530
Oh, no, we're all supposed to run VPN S.

270
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,130
Yeah. Well, but my point is

271
00:12:01,359 --> 00:12:01,890
like,

272
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:06,500
I treat every network everywhere like it's directly attached to

273
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,960
the public internet because at some point chances are,

274
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:12,989
well, if it's, if it's my phone, my tablet or my laptop, it's gonna

275
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:16,479
go talk to a public network at the library at Starbucks at

276
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,349
IKEA.

277
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,619
You know, on IKEA, I'm gonna hop on their Wi FI because they, you know, they,

278
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,020
the way they built their building, it's the, um, you know, it's the,

279
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,469
it's like that corrugated metal that they

280
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,023
concrete on. Dude. It's a huge fair day cage.

281
00:12:27,172 --> 00:12:29,002
That's what every IKEA building is.

282
00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:32,752
And like Home Depot is terrible as well because all the metal shelves, like,

283
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:35,583
you know, the, the two or three outside aisles of the building. Sure, whatever.

284
00:12:35,593 --> 00:12:38,322
But once you're inside the Home Depot, man, like, you know, the,

285
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,002
my cell phone data is just like crawling.

286
00:12:41,013 --> 00:12:42,103
Yep. Yep. Exactly.

287
00:12:42,112 --> 00:12:43,362
And so I,

288
00:12:43,372 --> 00:12:46,593
I like the beyond horizon idea of Google where

289
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:49,403
just treat everything like it's the public internet because

290
00:12:49,413 --> 00:12:51,732
either it is the public internet or chances are

291
00:12:51,742 --> 00:12:53,763
that thing will get plugged into the public internet

292
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,476
at some point. Yeah. Totally, man. Absolutely.

293
00:12:56,486 --> 00:12:59,745
A great example is like, my, my local network does I PV six

294
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,056
and

295
00:13:01,216 --> 00:13:03,995
my ISP hands me. I think it's a slash 56.

296
00:13:04,096 --> 00:13:08,536
And that's the IP S my Google Wifi is handing out internally. So

297
00:13:08,765 --> 00:13:09,966
I've never really tried,

298
00:13:09,976 --> 00:13:12,565
but I'm kind of guessing that you can maybe

299
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,406
just talk directly to the stuff from the internet.

300
00:13:14,466 --> 00:13:16,335
No, you can't. I at least

301
00:13:16,606 --> 00:13:16,625
go.

302
00:13:16,926 --> 00:13:18,015
Well, I shouldn't say that

303
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:23,046
when I tested it. I couldn't, I don't know who is blocking that traffic,

304
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:27,059
but I could not reach my IP D six gear from the,

305
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,929
I should probably try at some point, but more of a point I,

306
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,090
my suspicion is the Google Wi Fi was blocking it.

307
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:35,590
I should probably confirm this at some point,

308
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:37,969
but more of the point I just can't be bothered to care anymore.

309
00:13:37,979 --> 00:13:38,400
Like

310
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,169
my stance is everything, is the public internet. Yep. Yep. I, I agree.

311
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:44,179
I agree completely.

312
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:48,390
I think it is absolutely the right way to treat all of these problems

313
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,289
because it, it, it, let's face it,

314
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,700
we have limited mental capacity

315
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:54,570
and

316
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,289
if I only have to deal with one situation, it's a lot easier than two or three.

317
00:13:58,469 --> 00:13:59,890
Well, it's like the old GDPR thing.

318
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,250
And now California talking about privacy laws

319
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,250
that are suspiciously similar to GDPR.

320
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,429
And I'm like, oh, cool,

321
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,729
because you know where I work, we basically did the GDPR dance and I was like,

322
00:14:08,739 --> 00:14:10,330
we're just doing this globally because

323
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:12,054
my biggest thought was with the right to forget.

324
00:14:12,065 --> 00:14:16,135
Well, how do you prove that you are a subject of GDPR?

325
00:14:16,145 --> 00:14:17,715
Because I'm like, ok, so if you like,

326
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:21,955
live and work and reside in Germany and you're German and you have a German passport?

327
00:14:21,965 --> 00:14:23,934
Ok. You're under GDPR very clearly.

328
00:14:24,065 --> 00:14:26,815
But you know what if it's a tourist who's in Germany

329
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:28,215
and emails us

330
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,919
saying I want you to forget my email address, but they're an American, you know,

331
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:33,849
at what point, like, do they have to have a visa?

332
00:14:33,859 --> 00:14:34,969
Do they have to be

333
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,039
living there? Do they? I don't know. Right.

334
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:39,450
So, I was just like, I was like, because, you know, nobody's,

335
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,130
I haven't seen any answers for this and,

336
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,619
and the response was like,

337
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,859
we're just not going to worry about it. We're just doing GDPR globally, right?

338
00:14:45,909 --> 00:14:46,400
It's the

339
00:14:46,515 --> 00:14:47,614
only right way to do it.

340
00:14:47,655 --> 00:14:51,015
And I have a suspicion the European Union knew that would happen,

341
00:14:51,205 --> 00:14:52,364
which was part of the

342
00:14:52,815 --> 00:14:53,455
companies

343
00:14:53,844 --> 00:14:54,534
will do this.

344
00:14:54,544 --> 00:14:58,335
It's, well, it's like the California stuff where they do emissions control laws on,

345
00:14:58,344 --> 00:15:00,294
say, cars and the carmakers are like, yeah,

346
00:15:00,304 --> 00:15:02,155
we're not building a special car for California.

347
00:15:02,164 --> 00:15:04,174
We're just going to build them all a bit better.

348
00:15:04,489 --> 00:15:04,820
Yeah.

349
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,280
And, yeah, So, I mean, again, you know, it's just, yeah,

350
00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:11,739
having one standard to adhere to and more, like I said, more of the point.

351
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,380
I just, there's no way I'm going to be able to,

352
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,950
without getting a whole bunch of pi I from you.

353
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:19,109
And even if you do give me all your pi I and like a scan of your passport,

354
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,729
I don't know how to validate that.

355
00:15:22,109 --> 00:15:25,960
Like, how do I validate a Slovenian passport? I have no freaking idea. Right.

356
00:15:26,119 --> 00:15:29,690
So actually I just got a new driver's license the other day.

357
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:33,530
It was, it was amusing when I went in because they

358
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:34,669
now you have to,

359
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:38,109
they have this thing called Real ID in the US where you have to kind of prove your, you

360
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,669
and if you have a passport,

361
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:41,530
it's easy because a passport is like a magic

362
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:43,570
document because getting one is actually not simple.

363
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,169
It's real ID compliant already,

364
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:48,119
right? And so I remember I went in lady's like, do you have this? This is,

365
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,049
I'm like, I have a passport. She's like, oh, you're fine then.

366
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,039
And it was,

367
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:51,859
it was,

368
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:56,280
well, this is one of the reasons II I love having a nexus pass.

369
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,780
You know, it's like all of a sudden

370
00:15:58,179 --> 00:16:03,700
at all these places. It's like uh oh Nexus. Cool. Yep. Yep. Exactly.

371
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:07,969
What's interesting to me though is I understand these people are angry because

372
00:16:07,979 --> 00:16:11,119
a lot of their network security posture relies on being able to,

373
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:14,719
you know, closely examine and filter network traffic and

374
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,140
the anomaly detection of, oh, there's encrypted traffic going out to,

375
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,179
we're not quite sure where.

376
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:22,500
So it's potentially malicious. Let's go take a closer look at that. So

377
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,900
this whole kind of in a way increase false positives and whatnot.

378
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,960
But like I said,

379
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:29,109
I, it's gonna happen

380
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:33,599
your choices to not use web browsers. Maybe, I don't know.

381
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:38,159
No, no. I mean, so actually, you know what I would tie this back to is

382
00:16:38,489 --> 00:16:41,020
a couple days ago, from the time we are recording this.

383
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,539
Actually there,

384
00:16:41,549 --> 00:16:44,739
there's this other podcast I listen to called the Defense of Security Podcast.

385
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,690
It, it's quite good

386
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,510
and I'd suggest anyone, they, they took a hiatus, one of them got very ill

387
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,070
and they, they had an episode.

388
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,349
But anyway, they were talking about the capital one data breach,

389
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:56,140
which while it happened a long time ago happened while they weren't recording

390
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:00,469
and they had AAA really good point that they brought up during this,

391
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:04,229
that I think it's very related to, to all this is they were talking about the fact that

392
00:17:04,739 --> 00:17:07,089
if you look at a cloud environment

393
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:12,910
and you try to apply kind of the traditional networking viewpoint to it,

394
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,900
you're going to fail miserably because

395
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:20,739
while some of the skills carry over, it is a very new way of thinking.

396
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,689
Well, there's also different capabilities,

397
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:24,459
like some things that you used to be able to do.

398
00:17:24,469 --> 00:17:25,569
You just can't do in cloud.

399
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:28,348
And conversely, there's stuff I can do in cloud that I, there's no way

400
00:17:28,689 --> 00:17:30,709
I could do in the real world affordably.

401
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:35,000
Like, like with Amazon, I enabled Cloud Trail, it's literally three clicks

402
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,540
and every single

403
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:41,030
administrative event in our account gets logged. Right. Right. Exactly.

404
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,630
It was three clicks. You and I have had to do this stuff at our previous jobs.

405
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,260
And, I mean,

406
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,680
folks, this is basically impossible

407
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:51,790
logs. What are those? Well, you know, my favorite thing is like every time I hear

408
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,469
about things like not pet

409
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,859
or whatever and it's like, ok, so bad patch management.

410
00:17:55,869 --> 00:17:57,579
Number two, like how did we get infected?

411
00:17:57,589 --> 00:18:01,069
It's like, don't you people have file auditing, turned on on your Windows machines?

412
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,270
No,

413
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,089
or my all time favorite is when people

414
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:06,719
complain about performance at remote offices of files.

415
00:18:06,729 --> 00:18:07,170
And I'm like,

416
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:07,989
you know,

417
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,739
like Microsoft specifically has built a huge pile of capabilities into windows

418
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,150
for like shadow file copies and a whole bunch of stuff.

419
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,109
So that number one, you have like kind of live backups of your data.

420
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:20,890
So if somebody does delete a file, you can recover it in like 30 seconds.

421
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,010
And number two performance will be better because you'll

422
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,349
kind of have a cached copy locally of your data

423
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,250
that's at head office or whatever.

424
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:30,030
You know, it just magically works and like literally these,

425
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,030
it people who run Windows networks are like,

426
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,709
oh yeah, I guess we could use that. And I'm like, ok, lovely.

427
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:37,390
So, with Cloud. Yeah, it's,

428
00:18:37,579 --> 00:18:39,619
I, it's tough though because part of the prompt too,

429
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,829
I find I've dug through Amazon Google and

430
00:18:42,949 --> 00:18:43,310
Azure

431
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,589
trying to figure out what all are their capabilities, for example,

432
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:48,640
with relational databases and backups and with like

433
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,630
the S3 style of buckets and backups,

434
00:18:50,739 --> 00:18:54,790
there's just too much, there's too many options. It's brutal. I agree. It's

435
00:18:54,969 --> 00:18:58,619
like I, I need to, you know, literally find some, like

436
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:00,170
there are probably people out there that have

437
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,199
spent the couple 100 hours learning all three

438
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:05,959
of those systems inside out and can make a valid decision in comparison of them.

439
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:08,900
I'm not one of them. No, I, I agree. And this is,

440
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:12,930
this is one of the unique challenges I think we're sitting in the middle of.

441
00:19:12,939 --> 00:19:15,770
I mean, we're, we're, we're living through a time of disruption

442
00:19:15,939 --> 00:19:16,489
and

443
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:19,849
the last one was kind of the birth of.com,

444
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:22,449
right? Which I feel like was

445
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,650
that, that felt more like a,

446
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,150
a kind of rip and replace where we're replacing an

447
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,489
old way with a new way where this is more of

448
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,890
a kind of a transition where we're taking existing technology

449
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,949
and knowledge and we're trying to move it somewhere else.

450
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:38,150
Well, forklift it into the cloud, right? And a lot of it doesn't work.

451
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,790
And so it's, I mean, it's hard man

452
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,319
and it's hard to keep up. It's hard to know what's going on. I'm not gonna lie.

453
00:19:43,329 --> 00:19:47,469
No, I, uh, I, once a quarter I try and review all the Amazon services just to, you know,

454
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:50,109
because I'll discover new stuff where I'm like, oh, I can, like,

455
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:53,050
I was running gluster on a bunch of my servers and I'm like, oh, elastic files for.

456
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:53,790
Ok. Poop.

457
00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:54,819
You know,

458
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:56,880
for four bucks a month now, I have

459
00:19:57,449 --> 00:20:01,010
20% less stuff to administer and worry about. Yep. Yep. Exactly.

460
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,609
No, I know exactly how that goes.

461
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,109
I, my only complaint is still,

462
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,969
I wish I could like mount an elastic file system

463
00:20:06,979 --> 00:20:09,500
over the internet because that would make my life great.

464
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,189
You can,

465
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:14,260
you just don't want to jump through the hoops. No, you can't, you can't do it.

466
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:14,959
You have to

467
00:20:15,099 --> 00:20:15,119
do

468
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:15,310
it.

469
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:19,552
You do an NFS re export, you do what you have like a micro instance or whatever,

470
00:20:19,562 --> 00:20:21,863
mounting the efs and then you just reexport it.

471
00:20:21,873 --> 00:20:22,672
I don't want to do that.

472
00:20:22,713 --> 00:20:24,892
I just want to mount the EFS because then now I have

473
00:20:24,902 --> 00:20:28,743
to take care of that stupid micro instance and screw that.

474
00:20:28,753 --> 00:20:32,312
Your better option is go buy one of those S3 file thing of a jigger for

475
00:20:32,322 --> 00:20:35,863
your local machine that so that you mount an S3 bucket like a local file system.

476
00:20:35,873 --> 00:20:38,703
I don't want to do that either. I want an EFS anyway, whatever

477
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:39,206
a

478
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:42,245
complaining, I want it my way. Shut up. So you want your posi

479
00:20:42,566 --> 00:20:43,326
file system?

480
00:20:43,446 --> 00:20:43,965
That's Right.

481
00:20:44,215 --> 00:20:47,365
That's right. What you do, what you really want is just file storage.

482
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,566
I don't even know what I really want it for. I just think I want it. So

483
00:20:50,706 --> 00:20:52,595
I don't, I don't have a good use for it even.

484
00:20:52,605 --> 00:20:56,265
It's whatever, whatever, whatever, just pay black plate. What is it?

485
00:20:56,276 --> 00:20:57,406
Black Back Blaze

486
00:20:57,696 --> 00:20:59,526
Blaze, which is not a sponsor.

487
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:02,180
They sponsor a lot of podcasts actually.

488
00:21:02,189 --> 00:21:02,500
No, II,

489
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:06,719
I don't use them because from my investigation into

490
00:21:06,729 --> 00:21:09,550
them they seem to actively discourage exactly the way I

491
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,500
do my backups where I have all of my stuff goes to one central location and then I,

492
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,739
I mirror it out

493
00:21:15,089 --> 00:21:17,199
and I don't want to abuse their services.

494
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:21,170
Well, they really do want people who just back up their local computer. Right. Yes.

495
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:21,780
Exactly.

496
00:21:21,969 --> 00:21:23,199
And this is a perfect example.

497
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:23,500
Do you?

498
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:25,594
I remember reading about back plays how people were complaining, like,

499
00:21:25,604 --> 00:21:29,185
I can't disable it, backing up my C drive and back is like, yeah, ha,

500
00:21:29,584 --> 00:21:32,354
because we used to allow people to disable that and

501
00:21:32,555 --> 00:21:35,175
people disabled it and then a bad thing happened to

502
00:21:35,185 --> 00:21:37,555
their computer and then they called us and cried.

503
00:21:37,564 --> 00:21:40,555
I believe that. You know, so they're like, we just back up your c drive.

504
00:21:40,854 --> 00:21:42,875
That's it. Like it's going to happen

505
00:21:43,464 --> 00:21:45,344
and I could be wrong. Maybe they've changed that since then.

506
00:21:45,354 --> 00:21:46,875
But, you know, I, I personally,

507
00:21:47,329 --> 00:21:51,709
yeah. No, I think that's a reasonably safe thing to do. Yep. Yep. I agree. I agree.

508
00:21:51,719 --> 00:21:53,339
Let's, uh, we got a couple more minutes.

509
00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:55,810
I just want to briefly touch on one topic because I

510
00:21:55,819 --> 00:21:58,790
know we're going to revisit it in the future more properly.

511
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,510
But Github

512
00:21:59,689 --> 00:22:01,900
is a freaking CN A. How cool is that?

513
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:04,630
Yeah. They're going to help boil the ocean.

514
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:09,040
They're not going to help Kurt. They're going to boil it or, or? Yeah, I don't know.

515
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,800
So, why don't we start at the beginning?

516
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:15,020
Give us like the 32nd tour of what does it mean to be AC N A.

517
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:18,780
So A CV numbering authority is AC N A is

518
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:22,010
an entity that can assign CV numbers and typically

519
00:22:22,239 --> 00:22:24,439
they have a scope of what they cover.

520
00:22:24,449 --> 00:22:28,380
And typically most CNAs have a scope of the stuff that they produce.

521
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,000
So for example, Red Hat covers

522
00:22:30,314 --> 00:22:35,194
Red Hat software and Red Hat software that software that they consume and reship.

523
00:22:35,204 --> 00:22:36,244
They sometimes also cover, like,

524
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:40,135
say the Linux kernel Microsoft covers Microsoft oracle covers oracle, you know,

525
00:22:40,194 --> 00:22:40,885
simple.

526
00:22:40,895 --> 00:22:41,545
Now github

527
00:22:41,724 --> 00:22:44,505
is a little different in that I'd spoken with them originally and they,

528
00:22:44,515 --> 00:22:46,535
they definitely wanted to be AC N A for the github

529
00:22:46,694 --> 00:22:49,375
software like github desktop, things like that, you know,

530
00:22:49,594 --> 00:22:53,505
stuff that they produce and ship and that would be fine. That would be good.

531
00:22:53,515 --> 00:22:56,545
But no, no, no, no github uh decided to go

532
00:22:56,665 --> 00:22:57,344
all the way.

533
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:59,500
Um So they want to cover github.

534
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,739
Basically, they want to cover github.com/star

535
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:08,050
for everything that isn't actually already covered by an existing CN A so,

536
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,270
like Red Hat, you know, has like over 100 github

537
00:23:10,449 --> 00:23:10,790
repos

538
00:23:10,979 --> 00:23:12,890
and organizations scattered all over.

539
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,880
I remember inventorying it when I, before I left Red Hat, it was,

540
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:18,829
I think 100 and I found 100 and 21 that I could track.

541
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:20,359
Everybody is on github.

542
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:24,020
Exactly as they should be. It's awesome. You know, let's face it. right?

543
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:24,719
You and I use them

544
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,469
as does everybody

545
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:27,459
uses them.

546
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:28,410
Yeah.

547
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,770
So basically what that means is in theory,

548
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:34,689
once they kind of build the software and process to support this, I mean, go to github

549
00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:37,430
and do a search for cross site scripting flaw fixed or, you know,

550
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:38,729
fixed buffer overflow.

551
00:23:38,739 --> 00:23:42,140
While in theory, every single one of those now will have a CV.

552
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,810
And the best part is they can do a lot of deduplication,

553
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:47,089
um you know, with, with projects that

554
00:23:47,329 --> 00:23:48,839
kind of embed stuff or whatever. Um

555
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,599
because they have the dependency graph of all the software in github.

556
00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:55,770
And for most of these things, it's, it actually works quite well. Like

557
00:23:56,449 --> 00:23:58,489
they've already started doing security alerts, right?

558
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,810
Like I got one for uh an older version of Noo

559
00:24:01,229 --> 00:24:02,030
Gary in

560
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,829
a couple of projects, you know, where

561
00:24:03,949 --> 00:24:05,719
a dependency was pulling in an old version.

562
00:24:05,729 --> 00:24:08,150
And the coolest thing too is they're really, I mean,

563
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,680
if they just did security alerts and like

564
00:24:10,689 --> 00:24:12,380
traversed the dependency graph and said like,

565
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:16,209
hey, you're pulling in this dangerous version of X, I'd be like, that's awesome.

566
00:24:16,219 --> 00:24:16,349
Like

567
00:24:16,459 --> 00:24:16,939
that is,

568
00:24:17,739 --> 00:24:18,290
that's awesome.

569
00:24:18,829 --> 00:24:21,550
But they're doing, they're going even further of like, well,

570
00:24:21,699 --> 00:24:22,069
you know,

571
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:24,349
do you want to enable us to automatically create

572
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:26,000
a poll request against that to fix it?

573
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:29,719
So now it goes from, oh, you've told me there's a problem to, you're also

574
00:24:29,989 --> 00:24:33,160
suggesting the solution and if it's correct in which cases,

575
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,020
most cases it will be correct,

576
00:24:35,189 --> 00:24:36,439
I just hit accept

577
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:37,250
and

578
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:38,839
the problem is fixed

579
00:24:38,969 --> 00:24:42,680
and they're even doing some magic with C inc D and like looking at your, you know,

580
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:46,280
do you want us to let us read kind of your build results so that we can see like,

581
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,500
you know, like this thing, I, I suspect the logic looks something like,

582
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:52,390
you know, this component is kept current and kept up to date.

583
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,420
So probably updating to the next current version of it

584
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:57,500
is safe versus like you version lock to this component.

585
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,790
Hm, maybe updating that isn't so safe, you know,

586
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,300
and you need to take an extra look at this

587
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:04,780
and um but regardless they're doing an awesome job. Right. Right.

588
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:07,099
It's, it's super cool. Did I mention free?

589
00:25:07,109 --> 00:25:10,500
It's part of their business model, right, because they have the enterprise

590
00:25:10,979 --> 00:25:12,500
offering of github.

591
00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:16,339
And obviously, if you're an open source project or you're something small,

592
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:18,119
you can obviously use this for free.

593
00:25:18,459 --> 00:25:22,170
But let's face it. If you're more than probably five or 10 people.

594
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:26,729
You're gonna need to actually work with them in a formal relationship. And so

595
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,729
it's, it's not exactly free.

596
00:25:28,739 --> 00:25:31,979
I wouldn't call it that we're paying them and it's coming in like,

597
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:35,890
at all my private repos and stuff, it, it is zero cost to the users

598
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,329
apart from the fact that there's people who don't pay github

599
00:25:38,479 --> 00:25:41,050
to use github, like, like me for my personal projects

600
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:45,089
and then there's companies, but their assumption is by making it so compelling,

601
00:25:45,099 --> 00:25:46,290
you won't go anywhere else

602
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:48,160
eventually you're going to pay them

603
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,369
once you reach a certain size, right?

604
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,619
Unquestionably sort of, if you, if you're willing to have all your stuff public,

605
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,640
you can still do it for free.

606
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:58,670
It's when you want to go private that you need to pay, right? I mean, huh.

607
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:01,489
Ok. I'm gonna throw my bank, one of my banks under the bus here.

608
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,339
Uh Scotia Bank calling you guys out.

609
00:26:03,349 --> 00:26:07,619
They had a whole pile of public get repos with internal code.

610
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,390
It looks like basically they just weren't willing

611
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,199
to pay the couple of bucks a month so

612
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,510
to get their repos made private. And so

613
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,619
they had a whole bunch of software in there with credentials and stuff

614
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:21,790
because in fairness like doing proper credential

615
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,359
storage and management is not easy.

616
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,699
But at the same time, like this is one of Canada's like four or five big banks.

617
00:26:28,869 --> 00:26:29,949
So shame on you,

618
00:26:30,199 --> 00:26:32,939
you know, as a customer, I'm kind of annoyed. Well, in Kurt, it, it's,

619
00:26:33,349 --> 00:26:37,469
it's not even just about private repos because I mean, you can get private repos now

620
00:26:37,819 --> 00:26:39,229
on, on the free tier.

621
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:42,339
There's also, you know, user management and you know,

622
00:26:42,349 --> 00:26:45,989
the permissions and tying this stuff into a single sign on system.

623
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,369
And there's all these super cool features. There's

624
00:26:48,569 --> 00:26:51,920
in all seriousness if you are an organization

625
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,869
that uses source code management in any way,

626
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,839
which is basically everyone at this point.

627
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,560
If you're not doing source code management, please let us know.

628
00:26:59,569 --> 00:27:02,199
So we can short your stock, right?

629
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,750
But I mean, for real, you know, and I know github

630
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,640
has some competitors, there's GIT lab, which I get lab is really cool.

631
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:11,160
They do a fine job also. But it's just, it's kind of one of those things that

632
00:27:11,859 --> 00:27:15,650
it's, it's what is, I forget the, the, how this the breakdown always works,

633
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,569
but generally in any sort of environment like this,

634
00:27:17,579 --> 00:27:20,819
you're going to see 80% goes to the first player.

635
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,969
You'll have like 10% to the next guy

636
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:26,060
and then it's long tail after that. And I mean, I, I assume it's github

637
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:29,319
and GIT Lab are basically number one and number two at this point.

638
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:34,930
Uh I guess I don't, I've actually, I've literally only used Git lab

639
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,880
once and well, you know what that was, right?

640
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,589
It was a kind of a paranoid installation and

641
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:42,239
that was very much the exception to the rule,

642
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:46,319
like I've in the last five years outside of that one use of

643
00:27:46,459 --> 00:27:48,609
GLAB, I've, I don't know anybody using it.

644
00:27:48,619 --> 00:27:50,670
Uh There's a handful of open source projects I've

645
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,400
had to interact with that are using it,

646
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,989
but at the same time, they all have mirrors on github.

647
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,280
And the only reason I found them at GI lab is because I went to

648
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:57,770
github

649
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,979
and the reading, he said, oh, we moved to get lab and I said, OK,

650
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:02,119
so,

651
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,709
but there's a mirror, there's a perfect, they're generally a direct mirror on

652
00:28:06,219 --> 00:28:06,569
github.

653
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,780
OK. In fairness, I'm looking at the Git lab explore thing.

654
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,040
There's, there's a lot of stuff in there.

655
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:14,699
Just mostly stuff I don't ever use or interact with. It's good.

656
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:16,800
I mean, I won't say there's anything wrong with it.

657
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:20,040
It's perfectly good at what it does. I would assume it's comparable.

658
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,209
Yeah, definitely. It's

659
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,560
there, there's, I know there's some people that

660
00:28:23,979 --> 00:28:29,069
there's the whole open source ethical conundrum where Git lab is very open github

661
00:28:29,329 --> 00:28:30,400
less open

662
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:35,640
and that's fine. I'm, I respect that if that's your thing. Go for it. I, I get it.

663
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:39,650
I've fully embraced the as a service world run by other people because you know what?

664
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:40,900
I

665
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,410
am still the director of it at the organization I work for and it

666
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,119
better be a part time job because I also have my real job.

667
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,099
I need to get done

668
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,810
to put it bluntly uh that's fair. But anyway, anyway,

669
00:28:51,949 --> 00:28:54,500
so, yeah, we're gonna, we're gonna hopefully talk to

670
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:57,030
github in the near future about all this and that way,

671
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,670
instead of Kurt and I making crap up,

672
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,989
we can get someone who actually knows what they're talking about.

673
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,380
So we're very excited.

674
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,670
But yeah, in the meantime,

675
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,180
go

676
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:04,810
play your github

677
00:29:04,939 --> 00:29:08,180
settings and maybe enable some of the cool new security stuff

678
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:08,890
because like,

679
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,359
I literally came as a surprise to me one day I was digging through and I'm like,

680
00:29:11,369 --> 00:29:14,180
what does this give me automated alerts of security

681
00:29:14,569 --> 00:29:14,920
notifications?

682
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:15,880
Like, what is it?

683
00:29:16,069 --> 00:29:19,239
We, I thought we talked about this on the podcast. How is that a surprise?

684
00:29:20,449 --> 00:29:22,060
Oh, I think it was before that. Right.

685
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:24,540
And then, but I was more surprised by the whole, like,

686
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,640
do you want us to automatically fix your security flaws?

687
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:27,300
And I was kind of like,

688
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,239
yeah,

689
00:29:28,829 --> 00:29:31,239
like, please, yes.

690
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:33,300
Is this a trick question? Right. Right.

691
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:36,369
That'll be, that'll be the new defense like, oh, I didn't fix it because github

692
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,349
didn't fix it.

693
00:29:37,505 --> 00:29:41,724
And anyway, all right, man, let's call it. I think it's time. So thank you, Kurt.
