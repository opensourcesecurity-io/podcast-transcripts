Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:11,939
Curtsy Fried and my partner in hiding that unsubscribed button.

2
00:00:11,949 --> 00:00:15,279
-- Josh Pressers,
-- do we have an unsubscribe button?

3
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:17,420
I think we barely have a subscribe button.

4
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,920
I would assume it's done through the apps like Spotify and stuff,

5
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,489
but they don't actually make it hard to get rid of podcasts.

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,440
But I've noticed increasingly in email that the unsubscribed

7
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,906
link is like dark gray on black or,

8
00:00:30,006 --> 00:00:30,475
you know,

9
00:00:30,486 --> 00:00:35,706
it says like click here to change your email preferences or you know what I mean?

10
00:00:35,715 --> 00:00:36,265
-- Like,
-- yeah,

11
00:00:36,276 --> 00:00:41,186
you know what I started doing in those instances is I just click the spam button

12
00:00:41,605 --> 00:00:42,736
and that takes care of it.

13
00:00:42,805 --> 00:00:47,986
So, all right, before we start ranting about the terrible experience

14
00:00:48,192 --> 00:00:53,492
subscribing from junk mail, why don't you explain the topic of the day?

15
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:55,411
It's about literal dark patterns.

16
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:58,192
So here's the unfortunate thing is companies have

17
00:00:58,201 --> 00:01:01,782
realized there's a lot of things you can do

18
00:01:02,012 --> 00:01:03,012
that are,

19
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:05,452
are not illegal but they're,

20
00:01:06,272 --> 00:01:09,512
they don't, you know, they're not very nice or they're kind of,

21
00:01:10,199 --> 00:01:11,330
yeah, they're,

22
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,809
-- they're questionable. This
-- is not new mind you.

23
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:17,099
-- No,
-- this is not new but this is now,

24
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,889
it's kind of like social media where now they're

25
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,699
hiring people to explicitly come up with this stuff.

26
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:23,239
Well, a great example is GDPR, right.

27
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,129
GDPR got released and I was like, oh my God, this is going to make things better.

28
00:01:26,139 --> 00:01:29,589
And this guy I know who actually used to work for a European regulator.

29
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:31,410
He's like, no, I'm like, what do you mean? He's like,

30
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:34,650
is Facebook or Google worried about this? And I'm like, well, not really.

31
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,169
And he's like, yeah, so it's not going to work.

32
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,290
So let's, I wanna,

33
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,823
I wanna explain what the dark pattern is a little better

34
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:44,424
first because this is probably not something everyone's familiar with.

35
00:01:44,433 --> 00:01:45,054
So

36
00:01:45,454 --> 00:01:46,963
the concept here

37
00:01:47,153 --> 00:01:47,984
is

38
00:01:48,213 --> 00:01:52,564
obviously humans have to interact with everything, right?

39
00:01:52,573 --> 00:01:55,844
Be it a a website to buy things, be it

40
00:01:55,973 --> 00:01:58,113
an app, whatever, right?

41
00:01:58,124 --> 00:02:03,083
And we all have those experiences where let's say an ad appears

42
00:02:03,274 --> 00:02:04,804
and when you click the close button,

43
00:02:04,814 --> 00:02:07,153
it actually opens the website for the ad because, oh,

44
00:02:07,164 --> 00:02:08,757
it wasn't a close button after all,

45
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:13,218
it was something the ad put on the ad to trick you into thinking you could close it,

46
00:02:13,227 --> 00:02:13,617
right?

47
00:02:13,798 --> 00:02:15,397
That is called a dark pattern.

48
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:18,867
The idea being this is something that its sole

49
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:23,197
-- purpose is to deceive for some reason to
-- deceive,

50
00:02:23,207 --> 00:02:25,438
to trick, to manipulate,

51
00:02:25,567 --> 00:02:26,867
to make it more difficult. So

52
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:30,037
like a classic dark pattern is gym memberships easy to

53
00:02:30,048 --> 00:02:33,438
-- sign up for trying to unsubscribe is good
-- luck.

54
00:02:33,447 --> 00:02:37,188
It's usually easier to just get a new credit card than it is to cancel the

55
00:02:37,292 --> 00:02:39,162
gym membership. Right. Exactly.

56
00:02:39,322 --> 00:02:42,671
And the reason we're talking about this is in the United States,

57
00:02:42,682 --> 00:02:46,222
the Federal Trade Commission, the FTC put out a,

58
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:49,052
like a request for comment on dark patterns and they're going

59
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:52,251
to have kind of like a mini conference about dark patterns.

60
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:54,121
I fear that this is going to become a how to,

61
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,932
for the industry as opposed to let's try and make things better.

62
00:02:56,962 --> 00:03:00,552
-- I don't
-- think they need a, how to, I think they're pretty good at what they're doing.

63
00:03:00,561 --> 00:03:01,832
I mean, but anyway,

64
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:05,852
this kind of piqued our interest because obviously this is one of those

65
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:08,585
things that just feels like it's more and more annoying than ever.

66
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:11,936
And I'm pleased that regulators are looking at it.

67
00:03:11,945 --> 00:03:16,035
There's like a real cost like these are essentially attacks that are, are,

68
00:03:16,156 --> 00:03:19,686
it's an attempt to monetize people in almost all cases. Yeah, and,

69
00:03:19,796 --> 00:03:22,945
-- or manipulate them to do something that can be monetized. I mean,
-- right.

70
00:03:22,955 --> 00:03:24,425
That's, that's basically the idea.

71
00:03:24,436 --> 00:03:30,505
I mean, like a great example is right now when you go to purchase a Humble bundle,

72
00:03:30,516 --> 00:03:32,416
which I love humble bundles and they just had a

73
00:03:32,425 --> 00:03:35,386
Lego humble bundle I bought about a week ago.

74
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,009
And the idea is you pay some reasonable amount of money,

75
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,080
you get this big bundle of games, some money goes to charity.

76
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:45,539
But now what they're doing is they're automatically trying to get you

77
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:49,500
to buy their monthly subscription by when you click buy bundle.

78
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:54,139
It's also automatically adding that to my cart and then I have to take that out.

79
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:58,160
Didn't that happen to, to the donations for Trump where you made a donation to Trump?

80
00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:00,679
-- And it signed you up for a monthly?
-- Yes,

81
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,990
-- I remember that.
-- You know, and these people are going bankrupt or something.

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,479
I don't know.

83
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:07,619
-- I'll cry river
-- over that one. Yeah.

84
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,919
No, I've, I've seen even businesses that I respect doing that.

85
00:04:10,929 --> 00:04:12,580
So there's a local science museum.

86
00:04:12,589 --> 00:04:14,119
I'm not going to name because I actually do like them. But

87
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:19,000
they have, when you buy something from them now they have this like donation screen

88
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,798
and there's no option for zero,

89
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:24,040
there's an option to write in an amount and if you write in zero,

90
00:04:24,049 --> 00:04:25,529
it says invalid amount.

91
00:04:26,209 --> 00:04:26,850
So

92
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:31,220
you, if you buy something from them, you literally have to donate like a dollar.

93
00:04:31,799 --> 00:04:32,540
That's low.

94
00:04:32,549 --> 00:04:36,589
You know, it's, and it's just like I love this science museum and I love this place.

95
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,019
My kids love it. But man, whoever made that decision that, uh,

96
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,529
like shame on you?

97
00:04:42,005 --> 00:04:45,445
Ok. Ok. So anyway, anyway, let's, let's get ourselves back on track for a minute.

98
00:04:45,454 --> 00:04:48,424
Now is I like this topic because

99
00:04:48,654 --> 00:04:51,785
there's the specific instances of dark patterns

100
00:04:51,795 --> 00:04:54,325
which I'm sure everyone has a million examples

101
00:04:54,334 --> 00:04:57,964
of because we've all been hosed by this more than once in the past,

102
00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:02,000
but then there's just kind of this idea of and, and you're going to laugh at me.

103
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,279
But before reading what the F DC wrote about this,

104
00:05:05,299 --> 00:05:09,950
I never really put it into my head that this sort of deception

105
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:13,799
is something that regulators should really look at and do something about it.

106
00:05:13,809 --> 00:05:17,250
II, I guess just coming from the, like the, the internet universe,

107
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,369
I just assumed this is how it works and like that's wrong.

108
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,000
Well, I mean, we, we have long standing ideas and

109
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:27,657
laws in most countries around advertising a product

110
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,877
and that you can only say truthful things about

111
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:30,117
it,

112
00:05:30,256 --> 00:05:30,897
right? Because

113
00:05:31,027 --> 00:05:34,596
the problem is otherwise you end up with literal snake oil salesmen.

114
00:05:35,096 --> 00:05:39,416
No, literally, I mean, that's all this came to be like, and please don't do this.

115
00:05:39,427 --> 00:05:39,997
But you know,

116
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,647
the people that have made money telling other people

117
00:05:42,657 --> 00:05:45,217
to drink bleach to avoid or cure their COVID.

118
00:05:46,157 --> 00:05:50,497
And so this isn't like, oh, you know, ha ha ha funny or even, oh, you know, damn it,

119
00:05:50,506 --> 00:05:51,707
somebody lost a bunch of money.

120
00:05:51,963 --> 00:05:52,903
Like we're talking,

121
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:53,704
people

122
00:05:53,984 --> 00:05:56,044
have historically been willing to do things that

123
00:05:56,053 --> 00:05:58,063
will kill other people for a few dollars.

124
00:05:58,334 --> 00:05:58,433
That's

125
00:05:58,584 --> 00:05:58,614
right.

126
00:05:58,813 --> 00:06:00,384
And so, well,

127
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:04,894
the reality is we clearly do need laws and regulation around this because,

128
00:06:05,194 --> 00:06:09,313
-- well, it's a problem.
-- Well, look, this is, I mean, this is a great example of

129
00:06:09,414 --> 00:06:10,063
the,

130
00:06:10,093 --> 00:06:13,973
the virtual world lagging behind the physical world because this

131
00:06:13,984 --> 00:06:16,234
was a huge problem for a long time in,

132
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:17,223
in meet space.

133
00:06:17,394 --> 00:06:18,841
-- And so one of the, one of the,
-- in

134
00:06:19,321 --> 00:06:19,990
the meat space.

135
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:20,821
Yeah.

136
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,411
No, literally, I mean, we can get to, no,

137
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,821
I'm not talking about meat packing plants at the turn of the century because it's no,

138
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,811
it's just read, read Slaughterhouse Five.

139
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,860
-- It's horrible. Yeah.
-- Or you know what my favorite is.

140
00:06:30,871 --> 00:06:34,930
So the book The Jungle, which Upton Sinclair wrote is like his socialist manifesto.

141
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:36,700
Sorry, that was the one I was thinking of. Yeah,

142
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:40,710
-- that one.
-- So I did not know this until I happened to accidentally read it.

143
00:06:40,721 --> 00:06:44,941
And then I verified this. The Jungle is like a 250 page book. Ish 300 pages.

144
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,571
Give or take.

145
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,269
13 pages are dedicated to the slaughterhouses and

146
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,279
that's all anyone talks about from that book.

147
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,160
So think about that.

148
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:57,359
I, I remember I read it once and I'm like, this is horrifying.

149
00:06:57,529 --> 00:07:00,329
But anyway, OK, the, the thing I always think of in, in,

150
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:04,470
in regards to this and the reason it's top of mind is because

151
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,950
is anyone who listens to the podcast knows about a year ago?

152
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:07,679
Give or take?

153
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:11,820
I acquired an iphone because I was furious with Google for only

154
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:15,040
giving three years of support on their Android wasn't a nexus.

155
00:07:15,049 --> 00:07:18,290
I forget what the model was. Anyway. Right. Switched to iphone.

156
00:07:18,299 --> 00:07:20,489
I ordered a bunch of stuff from Apple and they

157
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,089
sent me two of everything none of the iphones unfortunately.

158
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,049
But like the cases and chargers and stuff. Right. So

159
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:30,329
I ordered two, I got four of them. So I've got all these extra charges and cases

160
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,170
and I'm like,

161
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,040
I don't legally have to send these back because what happened was companies

162
00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:38,010
used to send people stuff and then send them bills for the stuff.

163
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:38,420
Right.

164
00:07:38,429 --> 00:07:41,769
And the government was like, no, if you send someone something they didn't ask for,

165
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:42,640
-- they get to keep
-- it.

166
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:45,600
-- It was unsolicited stuff.
-- Right. Right. Exactly.

167
00:07:45,609 --> 00:07:49,320
I contact Apple because I'm like, I'm going to do the right thing and I basically,

168
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:50,239
I get a hold of someone.

169
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,440
I'm like, this is what you did.

170
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,190
They're like, oh, we'll check into that and get back to you in a couple of days,

171
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,109
a couple of days.

172
00:07:55,119 --> 00:07:55,359
I'm,

173
00:07:55,545 --> 00:07:57,845
hey, what's up? Nothing. I'm like, you know what? It's mine.

174
00:07:57,855 --> 00:08:01,345
Now, I give up like you've lost your right to claim any and honestly,

175
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:04,204
it would probably cost them more to get that stuff back than it was worth.

176
00:08:04,214 --> 00:08:08,464
-- But,
-- like, I once had a similar experience, I, I bought a really nice, uh,

177
00:08:08,475 --> 00:08:10,174
saw Blade at Home Depot.

178
00:08:10,244 --> 00:08:11,855
It was like an $80 saw blade.

179
00:08:12,065 --> 00:08:15,015
I get home and I, I start, you know, to cut it open and there's actually,

180
00:08:15,024 --> 00:08:18,125
it's two saw blades in two packages, like, kind of

181
00:08:18,255 --> 00:08:19,285
long together

182
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:22,739
because it's like one of those plastic clamshell packs that kind of snap together.

183
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:27,209
For ship, I guess because they, like, you can fit a dozen of these in like,

184
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,140
two inches anyway.

185
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:32,119
And I'm like, well cool, you know, but I don't need two saw blades. I only paid for one.

186
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:35,539
And so, yeah, I took the one saw blade back and the lady at the returns desk was

187
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:37,885
just so confused and I ended up basically just

188
00:08:37,895 --> 00:08:39,484
leaving it on the desk and walking away.

189
00:08:39,515 --> 00:08:41,664
I've done that more than once and I've never,

190
00:08:41,674 --> 00:08:44,265
I don't know if I've done it at Home Depot, but I brought stuff back to like, oh,

191
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:46,594
I kind of accidentally stole this, you know, here you go.

192
00:08:46,604 --> 00:08:48,734
And they're like, oh, well, thank you. And they just go put it back.

193
00:08:48,755 --> 00:08:51,465
What's fascinating to me about Doug Patters is part of the challenges

194
00:08:52,174 --> 00:08:52,695
is

195
00:08:53,289 --> 00:08:56,039
if you do dark patterns, you know,

196
00:08:56,049 --> 00:09:00,539
you can increase your revenue rate by like 0.1 of a percent by being a real dirt bag.

197
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:03,799
I assume it has a positive effect on revenue because I

198
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:06,309
have a suspicion you wouldn't see so many people doing it.

199
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,890
A perfect example. Here Dell selling pre built systems has a 10

200
00:09:10,994 --> 00:09:13,695
dollar a month hidden warranty on their systems.

201
00:09:13,924 --> 00:09:16,635
Essentially the way it works is you get the first

202
00:09:16,645 --> 00:09:19,015
month of warranty free and then you pay for it.

203
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,414
And that is the default selection.

204
00:09:20,424 --> 00:09:23,974
You have to find this hidden thing and like uncheck it and,

205
00:09:23,984 --> 00:09:25,895
and turn it off to get rid of it.

206
00:09:26,104 --> 00:09:28,614
But you, like, you have to know that this exists and go looking for it

207
00:09:28,994 --> 00:09:31,804
and, you know, and there's, I think it's on Linus Tech tips and uh, oh man,

208
00:09:31,815 --> 00:09:33,515
what's the guy with the long hair, his name?

209
00:09:33,525 --> 00:09:35,655
Um, he, he does, hw. News.

210
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:39,260
I have no idea. They, they, they showed the web page for this and it's,

211
00:09:39,869 --> 00:09:41,119
I probably would have missed it.

212
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,739
Like, if I was buying a prebuilt from Dell,

213
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,140
not that I ever would because that's the thing, right, that $10 a month for one year,

214
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,539
that's 100 like when I bought my used car,

215
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,780
they tried to sell me on a warranty package and

216
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:53,179
additional theft insurance and I'm like the warranty package.

217
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,200
No, like, because I know you're going to screw me on the warranty

218
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:58,690
and the theft package, I'm like, hang on. Like I have car insurance.

219
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,476
Like, I'm, I'm legally obligated to have car insurance.

220
00:10:01,995 --> 00:10:04,726
So like what he's like, oh, well, you know,

221
00:10:04,736 --> 00:10:09,315
normal car insurance only pays you the value of your car, not what you paid for it.

222
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:13,606
And I'm like, yeah, cars depreciate. I, I know that they suck.

223
00:10:13,835 --> 00:10:17,346
And he's like, yeah, so this car theft insurance will, you know, if your car,

224
00:10:17,356 --> 00:10:20,825
you pay $10,000 for it and it's worth $5000 when it gets stolen,

225
00:10:20,835 --> 00:10:23,265
it'll top you off the other $5000.

226
00:10:23,276 --> 00:10:24,515
And I'm like, no, like

227
00:10:24,651 --> 00:10:28,382
cars, do you know how often cars get stolen and not recovered here.

228
00:10:28,392 --> 00:10:30,271
-- I bet
-- it's pretty low these days.

229
00:10:30,281 --> 00:10:33,892
It's pretty damn rare. Like cars get stolen.

230
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:34,632
Absolutely.

231
00:10:34,642 --> 00:10:38,682
But they get recovered because most car thefts here are honestly,

232
00:10:38,692 --> 00:10:40,851
they steal trucks to then go steal trailers

233
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:42,911
and other equipment that they can actually resell

234
00:10:43,062 --> 00:10:45,791
because the problem with stealing a car

235
00:10:46,221 --> 00:10:48,942
is it's got like a VIN number and stuff. You can't just

236
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,299
sell it to somebody for, you know,

237
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,710
um, there's a great vice news thing where they show these, uh,

238
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:57,070
chop shops in California where they basically rebuild the car

239
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,320
using, uh, a chassis from, you know, like a,

240
00:11:00,469 --> 00:11:04,859
like a, a junked car with a clean, like legal chassis

241
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:08,690
and they basically strip the chassis and put all of the stolen car in the chassis

242
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:11,919
and they do this like overnight. It was insane.

243
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:15,375
But you also need a car worth something like my car is

244
00:11:15,565 --> 00:11:16,375
worthless.

245
00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:17,645
No

246
00:11:17,755 --> 00:11:22,625
one's going to steal. In fact, I don't lock the doors just so no one breaks the window.

247
00:11:22,635 --> 00:11:26,104
Like, if you want to root around in my car, great. Like go for it.

248
00:11:26,114 --> 00:11:27,304
Don't break my window.

249
00:11:27,424 --> 00:11:31,174
-- The window would cost more than the car
-- by definition of buying a used car.

250
00:11:31,184 --> 00:11:32,565
It's probably not worth stealing.

251
00:11:32,684 --> 00:11:34,565
-- Yeah,
-- exactly. Exactly.

252
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:35,065
So,

253
00:11:35,184 --> 00:11:38,284
but I mean, this is an example where they pushed it really hard and I was just like,

254
00:11:39,169 --> 00:11:40,150
no man.

255
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,979
And I, I wish I actually, in hindsight,

256
00:11:41,989 --> 00:11:44,979
I wish I'd walked out of there because it turned out the car needed new brakes.

257
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:49,380
-- Oh, right. I remember you told this
-- story. 1500 bucks, Canadian and new brakes.

258
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,020
So, yeah, that's

259
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:50,169
right.

260
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:51,210
Honestly, go auto

261
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,669
shame on them. Like they, they're just,

262
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,210
they're no, they're scam artists.

263
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:58,750
-- That's just
-- used cars, man. It's, it's rough buying used cars.

264
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,539
Well, and that's the thing. Right. It's becoming.

265
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,349
So I checked Google a bit and it's funny because

266
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:05,169
basically everybody agrees and even when I went to,

267
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:06,479
uh, get my brakes done,

268
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:07,830
the lady's like, oh, yeah.

269
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,049
You know, like you just got this car and I'm like, yeah, and she's like, oh,

270
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:10,640
where did you get it from?

271
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:11,450
She's, I'm like the goal

272
00:12:11,684 --> 00:12:13,344
in the west and she's like, oh, yeah, that one's terrible.

273
00:12:13,354 --> 00:12:14,645
Like, we've had a lot of complaints about it.

274
00:12:14,655 --> 00:12:16,965
I mean, used cars have,

275
00:12:16,974 --> 00:12:22,104
I should say used car salesmen have a long history of ripping people off.

276
00:12:22,114 --> 00:12:22,344
Right.

277
00:12:22,424 --> 00:12:25,335
So, anyway, let's, I don't want, I don't want to start complaining about cards.

278
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:26,705
-- Well,
-- and now, unfortunately though

279
00:12:27,015 --> 00:12:29,224
the software industry and the, and the worst,

280
00:12:29,234 --> 00:12:31,265
the services industry is learning about this

281
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:32,390
and,

282
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:34,789
and they're executing on it because you know what it works,

283
00:12:35,099 --> 00:12:35,989
it makes money.

284
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,140
Exactly.

285
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:37,349
I mean,

286
00:12:37,359 --> 00:12:39,859
you know what I was reminded of when I started reading

287
00:12:39,869 --> 00:12:43,510
about all this is in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

288
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,489
I forget which book it is.

289
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,070
It's the Cricket Wars book,

290
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,690
but they're in the Hall of Illusion Hall of Information Illusions.

291
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,070
I think they call it in the book.

292
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,340
And one of the things is they, the,

293
00:12:54,369 --> 00:12:57,030
the like announcer keeps trying to get you to accidentally

294
00:12:57,135 --> 00:13:00,474
agree to buy merchandise from them as part of their like,

295
00:13:00,484 --> 00:13:03,585
infomercial thing that you're, you're paying attention to,

296
00:13:03,594 --> 00:13:04,955
to learn about the cricket wars.

297
00:13:04,965 --> 00:13:05,275
And

298
00:13:05,455 --> 00:13:08,135
that was written what in like the seventies or eighties?

299
00:13:08,145 --> 00:13:10,614
Probably like this is so not new.

300
00:13:10,684 --> 00:13:12,784
I mean, I love how technology, you know,

301
00:13:12,794 --> 00:13:15,375
now cruise ships and Disneyland you get that RF

302
00:13:15,385 --> 00:13:17,565
ID bracelet that can just auto pay for everything,

303
00:13:17,575 --> 00:13:19,114
hooked up your credit card, bing bing

304
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,969
and you end up spending a couple 100 bucks a day that you didn't mean to.

305
00:13:22,979 --> 00:13:25,080
-- I mean, I,
-- ok, look, I,

306
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:28,070
that is potentially a dark pattern but that one I feel

307
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,239
less bad for because you should know what you're doing.

308
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,710
At least this isn't like they're not tricking you.

309
00:13:33,719 --> 00:13:36,919
But that argument can be made with virtually every dark patter.

310
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:40,570
I was buying a used car. I should know I was going to get ripped off.

311
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:45,130
No, we, no, we should have openness and honesty and transparency.

312
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,869
I, I feel like that's different. I'm talking about

313
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:53,099
the context of like you go to buy a computer from Dell and

314
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:56,549
you don't click the opt me out of your crappy monthly insurance.

315
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:57,119
You know what I mean?

316
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:01,590
Like that feels different than here's a bracelet that has magic money on it.

317
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:02,440
Good luck.

318
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,906
We know for a fact that people spend more money when they're not, like,

319
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:09,216
spending physical cash and it's electronic and they're not aware of it.

320
00:14:09,406 --> 00:14:11,255
I mean, let me put it this way. I,

321
00:14:11,426 --> 00:14:15,075
my, my current credit card, every time I spend money on my credit card I get an email.

322
00:14:15,085 --> 00:14:16,056
That's interesting.

323
00:14:16,346 --> 00:14:20,056
Like, and usually within a few seconds which, and then when I pay my credit card bill,

324
00:14:20,065 --> 00:14:21,276
it takes like 3 to 4 days.

325
00:14:21,286 --> 00:14:22,966
But, hey, whatever, that's like, of course

326
00:14:23,085 --> 00:14:25,526
it does. That's another example of, kind of not a dark

327
00:14:25,812 --> 00:14:28,281
but of an abuse of like, why does it anyways?

328
00:14:28,312 --> 00:14:31,262
And so I'm a lot more aware of the money I'm

329
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:34,521
spending because I get this email instantly to my phone saying,

330
00:14:34,671 --> 00:14:34,911
and it's

331
00:14:35,372 --> 00:14:35,581
pretty well.

332
00:14:35,591 --> 00:14:36,471
And part of it too is like,

333
00:14:36,481 --> 00:14:39,742
I'll order stuff online and sometimes it'll clear immediately.

334
00:14:39,752 --> 00:14:41,892
Sometimes it'll clear when it ships. Sometimes,

335
00:14:42,101 --> 00:14:46,552
you know, with a, with a service, it'll clear a day or two before the service occurs.

336
00:14:46,562 --> 00:14:47,802
Whatever, it's interesting to see,

337
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,190
kind of how these companies do it. Right.

338
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:51,179
Right. Right.

339
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,690
I, I think part of the challenge with dark patterns is, is they've,

340
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,809
they've gone to that

341
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,809
space of, well, it's not illegal. Maybe you should have known about it.

342
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:02,580
Like you should have known to inspect source and go and look for this hidden option.

343
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,700
Speaking of hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy, you know,

344
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:08,479
we we did file plans for the uh the bypass

345
00:15:08,489 --> 00:15:09,780
that we were going to build through your house,

346
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:10,820
you know, and it's like they were at the,

347
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:11,330
you know,

348
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:12,375
filing cabinet at

349
00:15:12,765 --> 00:15:15,546
the bottom of the stairs with a wine saying beware of the leopard

350
00:15:15,986 --> 00:15:17,265
in the dark, you know,

351
00:15:17,486 --> 00:15:19,666
in 3 ft of water or whatever. Right?

352
00:15:19,676 --> 00:15:22,546
-- And it's a
-- little tangent is I was talking

353
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:24,935
to someone the other day about this exact thing

354
00:15:25,075 --> 00:15:29,705
and I looked at, I looked it up. You can buy beware of leopard signs,

355
00:15:30,075 --> 00:15:30,565
which

356
00:15:30,765 --> 00:15:34,426
-- amuses me to no end.
-- You can legally own a leopard in the US,

357
00:15:34,572 --> 00:15:36,632
right? In the US. You can legally own wild animals.

358
00:15:36,642 --> 00:15:40,952
-- You can't do that in Canada,
-- in certain places. I believe where I live, I could own one

359
00:15:41,122 --> 00:15:42,081
but I don't want to,

360
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:45,952
-- it would take care of your squirrel problem
-- maybe. Or

361
00:15:46,101 --> 00:15:49,192
it could take care of my being a live problem too

362
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:51,961
that solves both problems.

363
00:15:51,971 --> 00:15:53,791
-- Then I guess
-- then I don't have to worry

364
00:15:53,802 --> 00:15:56,271
about squirrels anymore because a leopard ate me.

365
00:15:56,401 --> 00:15:57,742
-- Yeah,
-- a leopard ate your face.

366
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:01,940
Yeah. So, I mean, that's, you know, at what point?

367
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:05,080
Like I buy stuff on Amazon now and especially electronics.

368
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:09,219
-- It tries to offer me extended warranties.
-- Yeah. They're getting kind of weaselly.

369
00:16:09,229 --> 00:16:10,260
I agree with that.

370
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,109
I was buying something that costs like $9 and

371
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:14,780
it tried to offer me an extended warranty.

372
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,440
That's so embarrassing

373
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,820
whenever somebody tries to Upsell me on an electronics warranty,

374
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:20,969
especially for something like a laptop.

375
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:21,520
I'm like,

376
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:21,880
oh,

377
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:25,179
so you're saying this thing tends to fail after the 90 day manufacturer warranty.

378
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:29,140
And they're like, I'm like, so you're saying that this thing is so unreliable,

379
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,539
I need to buy an extended warranty.

380
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:33,346
And they're like, I'm like, wow, it really sounds, I shouldn't buy this.

381
00:16:33,356 --> 00:16:34,616
Well, like, which is it?

382
00:16:34,976 --> 00:16:37,796
-- Right. Either I need the warranty or I don't,
-- we know you don't.

383
00:16:37,806 --> 00:16:40,245
And I think even like consumer reports in the United

384
00:16:40,255 --> 00:16:43,765
-- States has said multiple times don't buy those terrible
-- warranties.

385
00:16:43,776 --> 00:16:46,676
That is something like 90% of profit in

386
00:16:46,685 --> 00:16:49,955
electronic stores now is their extended warranty sales.

387
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,705
And, you know, again, as much as I hate on large companies,

388
00:16:52,716 --> 00:16:54,635
sometimes Costco one year we don't care.

389
00:16:54,645 --> 00:16:56,825
Just give us most of the thing back and here's your money.

390
00:16:57,005 --> 00:16:59,026
-- Yeah, they're
-- really solid and, well, in fact,

391
00:16:59,132 --> 00:17:01,781
just bought, I don't, I don't remember if I said this on the podcast yet.

392
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:05,171
I bought an Apple TV because Amazon Fire TV

393
00:17:05,281 --> 00:17:08,751
has updated their interface and they added like a bunch of ads and I

394
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,832
was just super angry and I thought I'm going to buy an Apple TV.

395
00:17:11,881 --> 00:17:15,712
And I bought it at Costco for the simple reason, I knew if it didn't work,

396
00:17:15,722 --> 00:17:19,592
I could just bring back like the pile of stuff in a paper bag and they'd take it

397
00:17:19,832 --> 00:17:23,551
and it did work and I absolutely love it because there's no ads anywhere.

398
00:17:23,561 --> 00:17:25,811
-- And
-- then a week later they announced the new one.

399
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,689
Uh, it was about a month. I don't care.

400
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:32,020
Well, no, here's, here's what's wild about that actually. And this is again

401
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:35,060
where, like, as much as I love to hate on Apple sometimes,

402
00:17:35,069 --> 00:17:36,060
like they get some of this stuff.

403
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:38,900
Right. So they announce a new Apple TV.

404
00:17:38,989 --> 00:17:42,060
The new one has obviously big, slightly better chip more.

405
00:17:42,069 --> 00:17:44,540
You can buy a bigger one with more storage, which I don't care, like,

406
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,939
never going to use the storage anyway.

407
00:17:45,949 --> 00:17:49,349
But here's the thing is the remote on the Apple TV. Kind of sucks.

408
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,449
So they have a new remote,

409
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:53,489
but I can buy a, I can buy a new remote, which I,

410
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,459
I ordered one to just to see if I like it because I have two of them now.

411
00:17:56,469 --> 00:17:59,819
So I'll buy the second one if I want, but they upgraded the

412
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,859
I OS or whatever runs on Apple TV.

413
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:07,439
And all of the features they talked about in the new one are working on the old one.

414
00:18:07,449 --> 00:18:10,109
Like what? Who does that

415
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,810
well? And that's the thing, right. Apple, apple, apple, apple does that.

416
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:15,229
Right. Right.

417
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:19,824
But here's the thing is I feel like I'm so trapped in this ecosystem

418
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:23,155
of customer hostility when I find a company that doesn't treat me like,

419
00:18:23,194 --> 00:18:27,064
like a freaking piece of cattle, you know, traveling down the conveyor belt.

420
00:18:27,364 --> 00:18:30,635
-- I don't know what to do
-- I think. And this is one thing I like about Apple.

421
00:18:30,645 --> 00:18:34,425
Apple is very upfront and honest about, we're going to charge you a lot of money

422
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,430
upfront and

423
00:18:37,109 --> 00:18:40,630
you're probably gonna pay us a lot of money on a monthly basis for things like,

424
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,560
you know, maybe a bit of extra icloud storage,

425
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,099
uh apps.

426
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,640
Um You, you know, you,

427
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,239
you want some nice headphones,

428
00:18:48,369 --> 00:18:51,900
like I went through a couple of sets of Bluetooth headphones and then it was just like

429
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,050
I give up and I bought the Apple

430
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:57,650
ones and they're so much better the experience, right? They just work,

431
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,810
buy a new ipad, got to buy a new Apple pencil because why not?

432
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:02,609
That's because the,

433
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:06,890
the old one is incompatible with the new ipad and vice versa because screw you.

434
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,160
Ok. Uh I, I don't, I don't care for that but,

435
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:12,000
but I mean, overall,

436
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,280
you know, yeah,

437
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:17,640
my phone will work and get security and software updates for 5 to 7 years.

438
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,199
And so ironically, I'll,

439
00:19:19,209 --> 00:19:22,810
I'll spend a lot less because I'll use these ipads and iphones for

440
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,189
-- probably a good five years
-- probably.

441
00:19:25,199 --> 00:19:26,680
And you know what I just realized too,

442
00:19:26,689 --> 00:19:30,640
like both of my Apple purchases have been like rage fueled

443
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:31,560
anti

444
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,670
customers

445
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,189
reasons where it was first.

446
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:39,150
Google murdered my Nexus phone, which I was out of, out of hate. I ordered an iphone

447
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:42,599
and now Amazon ruined the fire TV. And so out of hate. I,

448
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,869
-- yeah, the interface.
-- It's so bad.

449
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:45,979
The

450
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:50,390
look on my kid's face when they saw the new interface. I'm like, yeah, that's the,

451
00:19:50,849 --> 00:19:51,199
yeah.

452
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,329
And the best part is you can only have, what is it,

453
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:56,579
five or six things on there and then you have to, like, go to the more items, menu.

454
00:19:56,609 --> 00:19:58,160
-- They,
-- they're apps. Yeah.

455
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,819
Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's super,

456
00:19:59,969 --> 00:20:00,810
it's horrible. Anyway,

457
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,020
doesn't matter. Don't care. Not my problem.

458
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:03,339
Yeah.

459
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:04,439
So,

460
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:07,849
no, these dark patterns, I feel like it's, it's like loot boxes, you know,

461
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:09,479
loot boxes were well.

462
00:20:09,489 --> 00:20:11,869
-- Oh, hey, you know, definitely
-- not gambling.

463
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,209
Yeah, definitely not gambling.

464
00:20:13,219 --> 00:20:16,910
But man, rats love pulling that lever for, you know, nondeterministic rewards.

465
00:20:17,859 --> 00:20:18,339
Right?

466
00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:19,300
And

467
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,260
yeah,

468
00:20:20,479 --> 00:20:20,819
my,

469
00:20:20,829 --> 00:20:24,780
my kids have spent hundreds of dollars on loot boxes and

470
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,260
I kind of have the opinion of it's your money.

471
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:30,219
I'm not going to tell you how to spend it, but you're definitely wasting it.

472
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:32,699
Well, I mean, the same could be said about a lot of things like candy

473
00:20:32,829 --> 00:20:35,420
anyway anyway. Ok. Ok. So we,

474
00:20:35,724 --> 00:20:39,785
-- we've rambled on for the better part of 20 minutes now.
-- So here's a question.

475
00:20:39,795 --> 00:20:41,405
How do we solve dark patterns?

476
00:20:41,415 --> 00:20:45,744
Cause so there is an actual dark patterns website with sort of a name and shame.

477
00:20:45,755 --> 00:20:49,584
So here's something really interesting is I will put a link in the show notes.

478
00:20:49,594 --> 00:20:53,785
So one of the things the FTC did that's really wild is they have a comment system

479
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,400
where people can submit comments.

480
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:55,510
Now,

481
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,670
the vast majority of comments are exactly what you

482
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,270
would expect in comments to a government website.

483
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,719
Also, their interface is beyond terrible, but

484
00:21:02,849 --> 00:21:03,550
they're trying,

485
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:05,869
I found one that was really interesting that I

486
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,430
will link to in the show notes where this

487
00:21:07,439 --> 00:21:09,739
person pointed out the fact that kind of the

488
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:13,430
the web and app ecosystem we exist in today

489
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:15,829
would could be compared to like

490
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:19,189
building stuff before building codes existed

491
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:21,630
where it's just like whatever random garbage

492
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,910
people decide to do they do

493
00:21:24,069 --> 00:21:27,500
and it could be unsafe, it could be dangerous. It could be stupid.

494
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,170
-- And I mean, some is good,
-- sorry side topic.

495
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,109
This guy made an early app for the early iphone because

496
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:37,540
it had like the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors and stuff.

497
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:41,270
And the app was essentially you got scored for, if you threw your air,

498
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:44,859
you threw your iphone up in the air and it, like, recorded how long it was in the air for

499
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:45,699
and,

500
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:46,619
and,

501
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:49,760
and you get like the high score for that and then Apple ended up banning it because,

502
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:50,349
you know, people of course,

503
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:52,349
are throwing their iphones up in the air and they're getting smashed.

504
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:55,380
And then there was another iphone app that I thought was brilliant.

505
00:21:55,589 --> 00:21:57,689
-- It was the $999 iphone.
-- Oh,

506
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,810
-- I remember that one.
-- Yeah,

507
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:03,609
-- that was brilliant.
-- Right. And that guy made a good chunk of money off that.

508
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:07,020
I don't know how much he made I would be surprised

509
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:07,449
that a

510
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,839
good chunk of money.

511
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:12,839
-- It's not like that app took a long time to develop.
-- It was just a picture.

512
00:22:12,849 --> 00:22:14,880
It probably took 10 minutes to make.

513
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:18,579
-- But, but anyway,
-- now should stuff like that be illegal or should it be like, oh,

514
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:20,900
you know, you should know what you're doing when you throw your phone up in the air.

515
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:21,560
No, I mean,

516
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:24,569
we probably shouldn't encourage people to throw their phone up in the air.

517
00:22:24,979 --> 00:22:30,119
I agree with that. I, I feel like there are definite lines you could draw

518
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,260
and encouraging people to throw their phone in the air.

519
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:34,109
It's kind of like one of those. Oh, I'm special.

520
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,959
I'll catch it until you don't and then it's broke and,

521
00:22:36,969 --> 00:22:40,510
and it's just a bad user experience because then people are going to blame Apple.

522
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,040
Well, why'd you let this app in your store if you knew it would break my phone?

523
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:47,520
There's a definite element of, yeah, Apple had their hand in this,

524
00:22:48,209 --> 00:22:48,239
I

525
00:22:48,349 --> 00:22:48,959
mean, right.

526
00:22:48,969 --> 00:22:52,339
So anyway, anyway, back to your question about kind of what do we do about this?

527
00:22:52,349 --> 00:22:56,760
And I'm always hesitant to say that like regulation is the answer.

528
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:57,949
We'll just engineer around it.

529
00:22:57,969 --> 00:22:59,599
-- But
-- I think there's certain,

530
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,229
there's certain places where regulation is appropriate.

531
00:23:02,619 --> 00:23:04,189
I'm not saying we don't regulate.

532
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:07,420
-- I'm just saying if we do regulate, they'll engineer around it
-- and they will,

533
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,390
and it's a constant game of cat and mouse.

534
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,234
Right. Where there's always going to be people who try to abuse the regulations.

535
00:23:13,244 --> 00:23:18,395
But I think the thing is the legitimate real companies are going to

536
00:23:18,844 --> 00:23:23,935
make enough of an effort. We'll say to not engineer around this in weaselly ways.

537
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:24,314
Right.

538
00:23:24,525 --> 00:23:25,255
I don't know.

539
00:23:25,265 --> 00:23:28,255
In past I would have sort of agreed but seeing like what Dell did, it's like, man,

540
00:23:28,265 --> 00:23:29,494
that is super.

541
00:23:29,564 --> 00:23:30,175
Oh, right.

542
00:23:30,185 --> 00:23:30,334
I'll,

543
00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:32,135
I'll tell my story that Kurt wouldn't let me tell

544
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:33,935
him earlier because he insisted it was show content.

545
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:38,689
So I, I ordered a new laptop for work. It, it's time for the new one.

546
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:39,170
Right?

547
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:42,939
And I ordered a thinkpad because think pads can run Linux and I, I get like whatever,

548
00:23:42,949 --> 00:23:44,040
a bunch of ra M and all that, you know.

549
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:47,500
So it's a little customized. It's not just like the off the rack think pad

550
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:48,410
and

551
00:23:48,849 --> 00:23:55,430
I get the email and the ship date is June 1st of 2024. Now we are recording this in

552
00:23:55,829 --> 00:23:57,250
May of 2021

553
00:23:57,849 --> 00:24:01,310
that well, and I'm like, ok, this is clearly a placeholder. They don't know right

554
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:06,319
after about a week they update it to October 31st 2021 which is what,

555
00:24:06,329 --> 00:24:08,640
like five months away from now, I think

556
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,349
so. It's the video card. Hey,

557
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:11,989
I don't know.

558
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:12,829
I don't know.

559
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:17,780
But the point is like, obviously it's hilarious because when it was ordered,

560
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:21,550
there was no like, oh, by the way, this isn't shipping for four years.

561
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,060
Well, and even if they don't take your money, that's just ridiculous because,

562
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:27,420
I mean, if you're ordering a nuclear reactor, you know,

563
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,900
Westinghouse or G is going to be like, yeah, that's, that's,

564
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:32,589
you know, it's not going out the door on Monday, it's gonna take a while,

565
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:34,180
but this is not a nuclear reactor.

566
00:24:34,189 --> 00:24:38,510
-- This is a consumer laptop and,
-- and now at the same time,

567
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,000
I don't know if they charge the, the corporate credit card.

568
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:43,630
I don't care either, obviously. But like

569
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:47,290
this is, I mean, this is another great example of, we don't know.

570
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,050
And this is shipping. Good luck.

571
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,530
You know what I wonder because we had that

572
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,569
experience where I was on the show before where we

573
00:24:52,579 --> 00:24:54,660
bought a couch and they didn't ship it and because

574
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,369
we had the ship date that they blew through,

575
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,709
we, I was very easily able to do a charge back.

576
00:24:58,719 --> 00:25:03,280
So I'm wondering what if I open up an online store and sell stuff

577
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,530
and give a

578
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,520
future ship date years out in advance.

579
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:08,489
And then my business becomes,

580
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,569
I buy the thing used in three years on ebay for

581
00:25:10,579 --> 00:25:12,250
like pennies on the dollar and ship it to you.

582
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:14,800
I'm pretty sure that's fraud.

583
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:18,750
No, because what if I sell it to you? And I say, look, it's not shipping till 2024.

584
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:20,119
I mean,

585
00:25:20,609 --> 00:25:22,869
I don't know. I feel like that's wrong.

586
00:25:23,069 --> 00:25:24,400
I, I would agree because,

587
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:28,130
but then the question becomes, how do you, how do you cancel it or do a charge back?

588
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:28,489
Because

589
00:25:28,979 --> 00:25:31,719
you know, is the, is the credit card company going to be sane and be like, yeah,

590
00:25:31,729 --> 00:25:33,910
that a ship date of 2024 is stupid.

591
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:34,880
So no,

592
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,449
I mean, because in my minor defense but October of this year,

593
00:25:39,479 --> 00:25:40,119
that's

594
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:45,630
no like this is not some custom gaming rig with massive amounts of, you know,

595
00:25:45,709 --> 00:25:48,489
you're not asking for a custom milled water block or something.

596
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,969
It's like, I want a laptop that you had on your website that

597
00:25:52,459 --> 00:25:55,349
-- you're supposed to be selling thousands of these
-- maybe

598
00:25:55,439 --> 00:25:56,260
and more to the point,

599
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:59,160
-- it's clearly not in stock and they should have said
-- so maybe.

600
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:02,510
I mean, I'm also getting a bunch of ram shoved in it so I don't know which it is.

601
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:06,319
It's clearly not in stock if it's going to take a minimum of six months to get to you.

602
00:26:06,329 --> 00:26:08,239
And, you know, here's so, here's the other thing though,

603
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,359
Kurt is when this was ordered.

604
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:10,839
Like,

605
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,520
maybe it said that, I don't know.

606
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:15,199
You know what I mean? Like, I don't care, there's so

607
00:26:15,329 --> 00:26:15,359
much

608
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:19,910
on these things. Right. I mean, every time I buy something there's tons of

609
00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:22,489
stuff and it's like, I'm not going to read all this.

610
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,089
Right. Right. Exactly.

611
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:25,900
And again, like, I don't really care if it was,

612
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:29,589
if it was a personal purchase I would have obviously been like, no,

613
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,449
this is not acceptable and I would have probably just canceled the order.

614
00:26:32,459 --> 00:26:32,729
But,

615
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:35,790
like, in my case, I'm like, yeah, whatever it's for work. It doesn't matter.

616
00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:37,939
One of my frustrations too is this is one reason I'm

617
00:26:37,949 --> 00:26:40,780
more likely to buy stuff with Amazon because of Amazon Prime.

618
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,000
But what I've noticed again, speaking of dark patterns,

619
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:47,209
there's Amazon Prime. Amazon prime one day and Amazon Prime shipping,

620
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:50,520
which means I get the free shipping from some schmuck.

621
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,010
Lord knows where

622
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,260
and it's going to take weeks or months to arrive.

623
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,239
Now in Fairness,

624
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,829
Amazon will show me the expected ship date before

625
00:26:57,839 --> 00:26:59,859
I actually like commit to paying for it,

626
00:27:00,189 --> 00:27:04,219
but they don't show the expected ship date early in the process. So quite often,

627
00:27:04,699 --> 00:27:07,010
what I find happens now is, you know, I try to buy something online.

628
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,229
I look at the ship date and I'm like

629
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:11,859
that is how many weeks from now or how many months from now? No.

630
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,349
So you know what I've done more than once and I mean,

631
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:16,359
you could blame myself for this maybe,

632
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:19,560
but I've ordered things from Amazon and then I'm like, where did my thing?

633
00:27:19,569 --> 00:27:20,920
Where's my thing? It hasn't come yet.

634
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,640
And then I look and it's like, oh crap, the ship date is like in two months

635
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,890
and then usually I cancel it, everything's fine.

636
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,160
And I order one that can actually ship, you know, tomorrow,

637
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,579
but we exist in this world where we

638
00:27:31,589 --> 00:27:34,589
are bombarded by information from every possible direction.

639
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:37,270
There is no way you can expect humans

640
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,709
to reasonably deal with kind of just everything.

641
00:27:40,719 --> 00:27:41,430
You know what I mean?

642
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,760
There's so many easy ways to either omit something or slip something in, like, oh,

643
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:46,829
by the way there's, you know.

644
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:51,949
Yeah, on page 27 of the EU L A you didn't read.

645
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:54,310
Yeah, it explicitly states

646
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,609
in three point font,

647
00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:01,459
-- you know. Yeah,
-- it's, I mean, I don't know, I feel like I am glad

648
00:28:01,609 --> 00:28:04,250
the government is at least starting to talk about this.

649
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:08,420
I don't expect anything drastic to change for the foreseeable future, maybe ever.

650
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,109
But I think just the fact that

651
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:13,089
this now that I've read about this more,

652
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:17,209
I'm seeing it in my brain and I feel like this is how it starts.

653
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,819
-- Here's
-- a thought. So we have ad blockers for your web browser.

654
00:28:19,829 --> 00:28:21,640
Should we have something?

655
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:24,920
Because a lot of these dark patterns are pretty like they

656
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:27,270
don't change a lot like they hide the subscribe button or?

657
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,160
Oh, perfect example.

658
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:28,709
We, we're,

659
00:28:28,719 --> 00:28:31,650
we're shopping for a new password manager at the CS A and we're trying one out

660
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,569
and

661
00:28:33,449 --> 00:28:36,500
you can only export your data through the desktop app.

662
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,670
You can't export your data from through the

663
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,290
website interface or from the browser plug in.

664
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,750
-- I mean,
-- that doesn't surprise me.

665
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,709
The desktop app is basically useless.

666
00:28:46,719 --> 00:28:50,060
It for example, cannot import data unless it's in one specific format.

667
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:52,729
Whereas if you want to import data, you have to go through the web interface

668
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:55,680
and we actually made the decision that if we do go with this vendor,

669
00:28:55,689 --> 00:28:58,920
we absolutely will be actively avoiding the desktop app

670
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,609
for all our users because it's so bad.

671
00:29:00,709 --> 00:29:02,140
I mean, every desktop app

672
00:29:02,244 --> 00:29:05,584
-- sucks, like look at slack. But
-- this is an example, you know, like what is it?

673
00:29:05,594 --> 00:29:07,145
I'm just looking at the types of dark pants here.

674
00:29:07,155 --> 00:29:09,785
This is, I believe it's the roach motel. Right.

675
00:29:09,795 --> 00:29:13,104
-- Like you can get your data in but you can't get your data out.
-- I mean, that,

676
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:15,994
-- that's a lot of SASS vendors.
-- Right. Right.

677
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:19,165
And like, they want you to come in but if you want to leave, no way.

678
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:20,984
That's not hotel California.

679
00:29:21,314 --> 00:29:22,165
Yeah. So

680
00:29:22,334 --> 00:29:24,255
this has become,

681
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:26,890
it's sort of like spam, it's become so normal.

682
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,089
We don't really think of it as that much of a problem. But

683
00:29:29,239 --> 00:29:32,060
what I'm noticing is now that I'm paying attention to,

684
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,469
where's the unsubscribe button? Where is the thing to kind of find out?

685
00:29:35,479 --> 00:29:39,150
How much does this actually cost with shipping? And well, simple question.

686
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,489
When I buy something online, I want to know two things. Really.

687
00:29:41,709 --> 00:29:46,010
How much in total, not how much is it, but how much with tax and shipping

688
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:46,829
and

689
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:50,130
when's it going to get here? Right. And I don't need like, minutes or hours.

690
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,810
But I mean, like, I need a rough estimate or days or at least weeks

691
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:53,579
because,

692
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,969
like, I've ordered stuff that will take 2 to 3 months to get here and that's ok.

693
00:29:56,979 --> 00:30:01,439
-- Sometimes
-- as long as you understand it and you're expecting it, I think that's fine.

694
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,989
Well, and they're upfront about it. Right.

695
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:06,229
Because I get some things have a long lead time.

696
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:09,800
I had this with, I ordered some appliances and there was a certain,

697
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:12,869
there was a certain, I don't know what you call, like the coating on the outside.

698
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,670
It was like the

699
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:19,510
the it's not the color whatever, but like my wife wanted a certain look to the,

700
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,069
the appliances and it was basically we have to build these for you.

701
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:25,270
-- So it's going to take a month. We're like,
-- ok,

702
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:29,540
the first ever couch I bought went to sofa land or sofa world or something like that

703
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,680
sat like late I sat on this, you know,

704
00:30:31,689 --> 00:30:34,770
found this really nice couch and it was just long enough for me to lie down and nap on,

705
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:34,959
right.

706
00:30:34,969 --> 00:30:36,439
So like, I'm like, I love this couch.

707
00:30:36,449 --> 00:30:38,939
I'm like, ok, how much to get one of these, you know, the price is reasonable.

708
00:30:38,949 --> 00:30:39,270
I'm like, cool.

709
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,640
Like how does it order when you know how, how do you guys drop it off at my house?

710
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:43,500
She's like, well, you know,

711
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:47,989
first we have to order it from the factory in Italy and I'm like, whoa stop time out.

712
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:50,709
I'm like, how long is this gonna take?

713
00:30:50,719 --> 00:30:52,709
And she's like 4 to 6 months and I'm like,

714
00:30:52,719 --> 00:30:55,949
is this floor model for sale right now about the floor model?

715
00:30:55,959 --> 00:30:57,000
Because I'm like, I'm not,

716
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,150
I am not waiting 4 to 6 months for a couch.

717
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,540
-- I mean, that does it, it would like
-- I needed something to sit on now.

718
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,229
Exactly. Exactly.

719
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:05,459
Ok. Ok.

720
00:31:05,469 --> 00:31:10,869
We're, we're out of time, I guess here's, here's the, the bit I would end this on.

721
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,489
It's just,

722
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,380
I'm glad the conversation is starting.

723
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:18,510
Go to the show notes. Look at this stuff, leave comments,

724
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,859
get educated.

725
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:21,479
And I think this is,

726
00:31:21,849 --> 00:31:24,589
I it makes me sad that I hadn't

727
00:31:24,729 --> 00:31:28,239
-- realized any of this before now.
-- It's insidious.

728
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:33,209
It is like seeing the thing Facebook is doing with the new privacy controls on I OS,

729
00:31:33,219 --> 00:31:33,359
right?

730
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:36,920
How Facebook is like this will kill freedom so you should accept it.

731
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:37,339
Yeah.

732
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,660
No, it's, this is the new normal and it's I,

733
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:42,359
I think part of it is people have to be aware so that,

734
00:31:42,739 --> 00:31:43,199
you know,

735
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:45,609
it just reminds me of all the people the first

736
00:31:45,619 --> 00:31:47,689
time they see the internet running without ads and like,

737
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:48,680
what the heck is that?

738
00:31:48,689 --> 00:31:51,719
And I'm like, this is the adblock. You want it on your browser.

739
00:31:51,729 --> 00:31:53,520
They're like, yes, I do. Exactly.

740
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,640
Hey, browser plug in authors, you know,

741
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,410
if you could maybe write a browser plug in that

742
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,310
warns people of dark patterns on a web page.

743
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,319
That would be pretty awesome.

744
00:32:00,454 --> 00:32:03,114
It, it would be, it sounds hard. So good luck.

745
00:32:04,135 --> 00:32:06,844
