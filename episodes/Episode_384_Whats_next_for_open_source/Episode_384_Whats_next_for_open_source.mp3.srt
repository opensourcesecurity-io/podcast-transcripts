Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast

1
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:10,029
with myself, Kurt Siefried

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,569
and I'm legally obliged to disclose that I'm a Canadian citizen

3
00:00:14,229 --> 00:00:18,250
and my not Canadian citizen partner, Josh Bresser.

4
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,909
It concerns me when you open a show like this because I know

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,930
you and you had this smile on your face when I hit record.

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,680
So they're like, I know you're up to something and I don't know what it is.

7
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,250
Well, just I'm going to remind people that under 12 fam,

8
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,805
273 point or this is not a contact.

9
00:00:32,814 --> 00:00:33,904
So you don't need to report

10
00:00:34,205 --> 00:00:36,525
listening to this podcast as a foreign contact.

11
00:00:36,534 --> 00:00:42,174
But if you, if you contact us or you give us feedback on the show and we reply to you,

12
00:00:42,185 --> 00:00:45,564
then you will probably need to report this as a casual contact.

13
00:00:45,575 --> 00:00:45,625
I

14
00:00:45,775 --> 00:00:46,474
see, I see

15
00:00:46,595 --> 00:00:48,014
unofficial foreign contact.

16
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:51,939
So I get that sometimes when I have meetings with Americans when they find out.

17
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,650
Yeah, over the last 25 years,

18
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:56,750
I've intentionally developed a pretty neutral mid Atlantic

19
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,860
accent when they find out I'm Canadian.

20
00:00:58,869 --> 00:01:02,720
-- Well, we had this on product security all the time. Product
-- security at Red Hat

21
00:01:03,069 --> 00:01:03,450
was

22
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,220
not all Americans, there was a bunch of Americans,

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,459
-- it was
-- mostly not Americans.

24
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:09,989
Well,

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,029
because it's a global company and that's kind of how the

26
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,089
-- math works out
-- before we delve into some rat hole.

27
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:17,209
I want to

28
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:21,059
explain like, so we talked about Red Hat

29
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,930
and then we talked about like is open source dying,

30
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,849
which was one of the conclusions of Red Hat's actions.

31
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,690
And I want to tie up this bow

32
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:34,489
with some observations and understandings of just open source in general.

33
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,930
And one of those things is

34
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,169
there are now organizations gene mostly us based

35
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:44,680
that are asking questions about what countries

36
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,559
are the developers from working on this software.

37
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:50,629
And sometimes they're legally required to do so under the Foreign Sanctions Act.

38
00:01:50,809 --> 00:01:50,980
That's

39
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:51,459
right. That's

40
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:51,750
right.

41
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,000
And it's, and this is what I love is when people are like, oh,

42
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,699
these companies are being jerks and it's like,

43
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:56,980
it's like trademark law,

44
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,989
I'm required to protect my trademark. I don't want to be a jerk.

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,430
But if I don't do this, I lose my trademark. That's right. That's

46
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:07,589
right. And same thing with like, you can't just violate foreign sanctions. And

47
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,490
hopefully Uncle Sam

48
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,179
-- would be like, oh, we understand it's fine not
-- just sanctions,

49
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,449
the country of China comes up consistently in these conversations of,

50
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,779
are there any Chinese developers

51
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:22,059
that are contributing to this software?

52
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:25,220
-- Yeah,
-- I mean, we've banned their telecoms equipment from Canada

53
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,070
so much so, but Now,

54
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,550
the cell phone companies are saying that the deployment of high

55
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:32,380
speed internet and cell phones in rural areas is delayed because,

56
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,179
well, I guess we have to go buy the more expensive stuff from Europe.

57
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:39,750
Well, and I'm sure those companies ramping up production isn't a

58
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,929
two month effort. It probably takes 2 to 4 for years is my case.

59
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,460
Right. Exactly.

60
00:02:46,779 --> 00:02:52,050
So, anyway, ok, there's a lot for us to cover in this one. And I want to start with

61
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:55,029
measuring open source because I think everything is,

62
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:57,080
-- is rooted there
-- by lines of code.

63
00:02:57,089 --> 00:02:57,970
That's how you measure it.

64
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,059
That's how you measure source code by lines of code. Everybody knows this.

65
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,970
OK? So there is a project

66
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,029
that is at the open SSF

67
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,770
that is called

68
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:08,809
scorecard.

69
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:09,470
OK?

70
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:12,550
And scorecard is trying to put together

71
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,479
a an automated list of things you can look

72
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,110
at an open source project is doing or not doing

73
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,649
and then basically give a score

74
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,899
like zero bad 100 good type thing, right? That's not exactly how it works.

75
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,550
You get the idea.

76
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:27,029
Yeah.

77
00:03:27,529 --> 00:03:30,830
And this feels like a good idea,

78
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:31,369
right?

79
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,050
Where I want to be able to look at an open source project and say how good or bad is this?

80
00:03:36,059 --> 00:03:38,669
Well, like I can get blamed to find out who wrote the code.

81
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:42,270
-- Why can't I get blamed to find out what country it's from
-- the the country to my

82
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,320
knowledge at this moment is not taken into account. But there are questions like,

83
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,389
how many developers does it have,

84
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:52,339
do they have Binaries checked into their G

85
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,070
repo that aren't for tests?

86
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,889
Because obviously, like you can run tests on Binaries, things like that.

87
00:03:57,899 --> 00:04:00,320
But there's questions like, are, are they using C I?

88
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,500
Do they have a repo?

89
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,110
-- That,
-- that is one of the questions. Yes.

90
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,869
And if you don't, I don't think you can score very much,

91
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,270
but you get the idea right?

92
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:10,429
There's all of these things they look at and then

93
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,279
they try to make it decision based on that.

94
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:14,619
This also then lends itself to a question.

95
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,079
You asked me a couple of weeks ago, which is,

96
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:24,440
is A I generated code any different than a single project maintainer.

97
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:27,200
-- Mhm.
-- And I think it's not,

98
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,959
but

99
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,790
-- that's kind of a different story and,
-- and just to be clear,

100
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:33,540
let's completely ignore the copyright issue around A

101
00:04:33,549 --> 00:04:35,410
I code because obviously that just makes things

102
00:04:35,619 --> 00:04:38,089
so much complicated. Let's just magically pretend

103
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:42,730
-- that A I code is somehow acceptable from a copyright perspective.
-- It probably is.

104
00:04:42,739 --> 00:04:44,579
But that's another, it's complicated.

105
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,890
Well, it also depends on knowing that it came from an A I and II.

106
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,109
I have a suspicion,

107
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:52,410
small suspicion that some developers may have used

108
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,029
A I to generate code and checked it in

109
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:55,839
and not disclose that they did that.

110
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,410
I

111
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:57,809
think this might have happened.

112
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:00,399
-- It, it almost certainly has, of
-- course,

113
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,950
at some point somebody's gonna do

114
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:08,109
an analysis of get commits of the period from November 2022 to now.

115
00:05:08,589 --> 00:05:10,829
And they're going to look at all the developers that went from like

116
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:14,070
a normal amount of work to suddenly checking in twice as much code

117
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:16,769
right around chat GP T four being released.

118
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:17,480
Ok?

119
00:05:17,489 --> 00:05:22,570
I'm going to give you like a 32nd licensing kind of overview here in the,

120
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:26,850
the way it's currently viewed a project will be say licensed Apache two.

121
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:29,269
Ok. Now, mind you as well, I'm not a lawyer.

122
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,290
So like, please don't get your legal advice from me or Kurt or

123
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:33,640
ever.

124
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,170
-- But
-- I think we're qualified to give recommendations on sandwiches.

125
00:05:37,179 --> 00:05:42,279
-- Maybe
-- I do like sandwiches. But anyway, so a project might be like Apache two, right?

126
00:05:42,489 --> 00:05:46,260
And so if you include say a bit of software

127
00:05:46,269 --> 00:05:48,470
that is public domain and this happens all the time,

128
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,570
that bit of software is still technically public domain,

129
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:55,920
but it is part part of an Apache two license project, let's say.

130
00:05:55,929 --> 00:05:59,600
And so it's generally understood that the project as a whole is Apache two.

131
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:04,320
If you know, for certain a piece of software is covered by say public domain,

132
00:06:04,549 --> 00:06:06,600
you could extract that code

133
00:06:07,109 --> 00:06:08,140
and use it

134
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:12,299
because you don't have to give credit for public for un copyrighted stuff,

135
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:13,170
-- basically,
-- right?

136
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:16,290
An example might be there's like so many implementations

137
00:06:16,299 --> 00:06:18,279
-- of GS that floating around or XML
-- parsers,

138
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,690
some of which are public domain like Z

139
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:25,579
Lib is functionally unlicensed if I remember correctly. But anyway,

140
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:28,500
now when you have A I generated stuff

141
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,570
to date.

142
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:34,190
The copyright office in the United States has said A I generated content is not co

143
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:38,467
-- writeable, meaning it is functionally public domain work. Yeah,
-- that may

144
00:06:38,627 --> 00:06:39,136
change.

145
00:06:39,326 --> 00:06:41,247
And that's another thing is we're just assuming

146
00:06:41,256 --> 00:06:43,937
an implicit us centric view of this problem.

147
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:45,536
I have that because I live here

148
00:06:45,717 --> 00:06:45,976
but

149
00:06:46,256 --> 00:06:47,367
I have that because I live

150
00:06:47,486 --> 00:06:47,516
in

151
00:06:47,837 --> 00:06:47,937
Canada

152
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,557
-- of our foreign trade with
-- you.

153
00:06:50,867 --> 00:06:53,416
You're changed to us whether you like it or not.

154
00:06:53,986 --> 00:06:54,106
That's

155
00:06:54,337 --> 00:06:54,397
right.

156
00:06:55,027 --> 00:06:56,856
But here's the thing, here's where it gets weird.

157
00:06:56,867 --> 00:06:59,967
Let's say you generate a bunch of A I art,

158
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:01,777
right? Let's say you make 100 images.

159
00:07:01,914 --> 00:07:01,944
The

160
00:07:02,303 --> 00:07:04,614
the pictures themselves

161
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:06,553
are not covered by copyright,

162
00:07:06,563 --> 00:07:08,414
but now you put them into a collection of

163
00:07:08,424 --> 00:07:10,933
works you're calling Kurt's awesome A I pictures,

164
00:07:10,944 --> 00:07:11,484
right?

165
00:07:11,854 --> 00:07:17,414
The collection of work, the book you just made is copyrightable,

166
00:07:17,424 --> 00:07:19,164
but the individual pictures are not.

167
00:07:19,174 --> 00:07:23,023
So for example, if I reproduced your book in the same order,

168
00:07:23,144 --> 00:07:27,014
you could make a plausible argument that I am violating your copyright

169
00:07:27,234 --> 00:07:28,334
even though

170
00:07:28,563 --> 00:07:30,571
it is all copyright free images.

171
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,851
Now, if I put them in a different order, I'm probably fine.

172
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,781
And so this is where it gets really weird and complicated and the

173
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:39,561
law has not fully weighed in on all of this stuff yet.

174
00:07:39,781 --> 00:07:41,960
Well, I mean, it goes back to the phone book argument, right?

175
00:07:41,971 --> 00:07:43,661
Where the phone book is copyrighted,

176
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,140
but the phone numbers and names and addresses are simple facts.

177
00:07:47,151 --> 00:07:47,770
-- That,
-- that's right.

178
00:07:47,911 --> 00:07:50,121
You can't exactly copyright.

179
00:07:50,281 --> 00:07:52,270
That's right. That's right. Facts can't be copyrighted.

180
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:56,071
But if you put the facts in a certain order now you can copyright that. Exactly. Ok.

181
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:56,651
Ok.

182
00:07:56,989 --> 00:08:00,109
So now the, the other piece of that though I want to touch on is

183
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,790
the question becomes, I'm using A I generated code,

184
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:08,450
how is A I generated code better than an open source project with one maintainer?

185
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:10,089
And I think it's not.

186
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,640
And here's my explanation behind that.

187
00:08:12,929 --> 00:08:16,589
When we think of open source, we generally think of the

188
00:08:16,809 --> 00:08:19,769
kind of larger commons

189
00:08:20,109 --> 00:08:22,929
community universe where you have like

190
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:23,730
herd immunity.

191
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:24,140
I

192
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,350
call it, well, let's just call it herd immunity, right?

193
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:28,970
You have multiple developers, lots of users.

194
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:32,700
So you end up in a situation where let's say there is a security issue,

195
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:33,969
there is a backdoor,

196
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:35,052
there is something

197
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,351
some of the people will get hit by it.

198
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,780
But then we will, it's kind of like the immune system, right?

199
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:44,062
Like the virus kills some of your cells before your body realizes. Oh, holy crap.

200
00:08:44,072 --> 00:08:46,481
We gotta go take care of this thing, right? In, in,

201
00:08:46,642 --> 00:08:48,291
in a pandemic type situation,

202
00:08:48,302 --> 00:08:50,942
a bunch of people get sick and die first and then we're like, oh crap,

203
00:08:50,952 --> 00:08:52,221
we have to figure this out.

204
00:08:52,512 --> 00:08:54,981
So anyway, if you have one open source developer, you could,

205
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,622
you could make the plausible argument

206
00:08:56,781 --> 00:08:59,331
that people aren't looking at this. Right. There's not

207
00:08:59,494 --> 00:09:01,484
-- eyeballs
-- and it's actually more subtle than that.

208
00:09:01,494 --> 00:09:03,994
Not only are people not looking at this and there's not enough eyeballs

209
00:09:04,004 --> 00:09:07,314
for the sake of argument if that developer is away on vacation.

210
00:09:07,504 --> 00:09:09,994
How do you update the source code? Right. Right. Well, that's just it.

211
00:09:10,004 --> 00:09:12,903
So, even if somebody is willing to write a patch and submit it now, what?

212
00:09:12,914 --> 00:09:14,674
And, and for example, we've seen this happen,

213
00:09:14,684 --> 00:09:17,754
like youtube DL is going through this right now where they've refused to

214
00:09:17,763 --> 00:09:21,124
ship an update for months because apparently their C I CD system is broken

215
00:09:21,283 --> 00:09:22,473
and it's also,

216
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:24,633
there's been a change in youtube's back end that

217
00:09:24,825 --> 00:09:28,495
breaks the software. And so there's a one line patch you need to do to make it all work.

218
00:09:28,505 --> 00:09:30,606
-- Oh, that's
-- right. You, you talked about this a couple of weeks ago

219
00:09:30,866 --> 00:09:34,616
and so like, do we? Well, OK, if I fork it now, how do I tell the community? Right.

220
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,075
We, we talked about this on a previous show.

221
00:09:36,106 --> 00:09:37,825
So I'm just going to point out that it's not,

222
00:09:37,835 --> 00:09:40,375
it's not just about getting the one developer who

223
00:09:40,385 --> 00:09:42,245
understands the code base to write a code patch.

224
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,685
You could have the code patch,

225
00:09:43,926 --> 00:09:46,515
but you still need to get it checked in, you need to get a release cut,

226
00:09:46,526 --> 00:09:50,125
you need to get a change log and notification to people and all that stuff done.

227
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:50,770
And

228
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:51,520
that's

229
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:53,469
where having more than one developer.

230
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:56,010
Well, that's just, that's just one developer, multiple users, right?

231
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,330
When you have A I generated code, you probably have one developer,

232
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:03,890
the A I and one user you and so there's going to be bugs and you're not

233
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:10,049
going to find many of them because you're not going to do the crazy herd immunity,

234
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:14,719
flexing of this code. You're going to exercise kind of the one thing you need to do.

235
00:10:14,729 --> 00:10:16,039
And so that's where I,

236
00:10:16,132 --> 00:10:19,442
I think anyone claiming that one developer open source is somehow

237
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,593
dangerous but then is willing to use A I generated code.

238
00:10:22,603 --> 00:10:27,302
-- You are a hypocrite is my comment
-- there. I would extend that to also then

239
00:10:27,403 --> 00:10:31,122
anybody that writes their own code is by definition a one developer code shop,

240
00:10:31,153 --> 00:10:32,973
you totally are 100%.

241
00:10:33,013 --> 00:10:34,882
And the thing is that's fine for internal stuff.

242
00:10:34,893 --> 00:10:39,232
Like I have a bunch of shell scripts that an attacker can attack

243
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,273
like technically speaking youtube,

244
00:10:41,283 --> 00:10:44,695
I guess could have hack me because I'm interfacing with youtube to download stuff,

245
00:10:45,015 --> 00:10:46,135
but that's not gonna happen.

246
00:10:46,306 --> 00:10:47,515
Right. Right. And, and

247
00:10:47,616 --> 00:10:47,906
that's just

248
00:10:48,205 --> 00:10:53,935
-- not a concern.
-- I, I think the other part of this is when you are developing software,

249
00:10:54,185 --> 00:10:57,426
a software team of one while it exists

250
00:10:57,676 --> 00:10:58,926
often is

251
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:03,166
not common where you're going to have someone else

252
00:11:03,176 --> 00:11:07,156
using or testing your product which changes the dynamic.

253
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:07,416
Right,

254
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:13,020
-- hopefully is key.
-- But this is I think where A I takes off is it's the same

255
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:14,080
paradigm

256
00:11:14,229 --> 00:11:15,340
of spreadsheets

257
00:11:15,489 --> 00:11:17,940
in the sense of I have a bunch of data

258
00:11:18,359 --> 00:11:19,669
that I need to manipulate to,

259
00:11:19,989 --> 00:11:20,940
to create a chart

260
00:11:21,489 --> 00:11:22,890
uh once a month for a report.

261
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,609
Now, I can go talk to my devs and they're a bunch of surly weirdos

262
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,299
and it'll never get done.

263
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:31,340
Or I can kind of jam the data up in a spreadsheet and kind of make it work myself.

264
00:11:31,349 --> 00:11:33,179
And that's what people ended up doing by and large

265
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:34,859
and to the point now where

266
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,619
to put it bluntly,

267
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,059
the world's economy runs on a bunch of Janky spreadsheets

268
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,820
that the numbers may or may not be right?

269
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,330
-- It
-- always has, it always has.

270
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,760
I don't think this is an apt comparison in this context. I'm not saying A I is bad.

271
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:49,679
I'm just saying it has to be viewed in the proper context.

272
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,580
-- But
-- what I'm trying to point out is some people forget as much as they want to disown

273
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,099
the quality of A I

274
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,460
and users given a choice between getting something Janky and done

275
00:11:58,979 --> 00:12:00,179
and scratching their itch

276
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,539
versus having to wait or talk to the devs or get a budget.

277
00:12:03,549 --> 00:12:06,820
This is the topic that we were going to get to eventually,

278
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,169
right? Where

279
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:12,739
I'm going to throw the scorecard project under the bus a little bit here in

280
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,179
this context

281
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,049
and

282
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:19,380
when you are a developer or you're an organization doing something,

283
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,169
building a product, building a service, providing a service, whatever, right?

284
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:26,179
There's every, every company has their, their thing they do.

285
00:12:26,229 --> 00:12:30,140
If you look at something like open source open SSF scorecard,

286
00:12:30,429 --> 00:12:34,380
and you might say, oh, this open source project has a score of, of negative 12.

287
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,049
And it's obviously terrible.

288
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:40,549
You can't use it if it's the only library that does what you need it to do.

289
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,969
Your developers literally don't care,

290
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:46,880
they're going to use it and here's the thing and here's how this works out.

291
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,530
If you're a security person and you tell your developers,

292
00:12:49,539 --> 00:12:52,210
you can't use any project that has a score less than this,

293
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:52,650
right?

294
00:12:52,659 --> 00:12:56,359
And now this, this used to happen back in the days when open source was brand new

295
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,679
companies would say no

296
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:58,770
open source in the product

297
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,229
developers don't say,

298
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:03,609
oh I just won't use this thing that exactly solves the problem I have

299
00:13:03,739 --> 00:13:05,159
-- just cut and paste. That's
-- right.

300
00:13:05,229 --> 00:13:09,289
They find a way like life finds a way is exactly what happens here.

301
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:14,409
And so this is where I find the whole concept of what country is someone from?

302
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:18,929
Did A I generate this code? Is this project scoring? Well, on open source,

303
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:24,450
those are secondary questions to the question of does this solve the problem?

304
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,330
I have?

305
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,510
Well, it it, I mean, this is exactly like public health.

306
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:32,200
There are some things that we should all be doing like washing

307
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:35,419
our hands with soap once in a while brushing our teeth,

308
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:36,710
at least once a day.

309
00:13:36,739 --> 00:13:38,409
Flossing. No, I'm serious.

310
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:41,940
-- Like
-- this is just brush your teeth twice a day, twice a day and floss, floss, once,

311
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:42,539
brush twice.

312
00:13:42,599 --> 00:13:47,250
But I mean, I think if we could get everybody to brush their teeth once a day,

313
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,525
well, that would be a lot or brushing them that's currently going on. Probably

314
00:13:51,844 --> 00:13:53,405
same thing with hand washing with soap.

315
00:13:53,414 --> 00:13:56,684
We don't live in that perfect world and we can't make people do things. So then

316
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,364
I think the difference is now what do

317
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:03,234
harm reduction strategies look like where we accept?

318
00:14:03,244 --> 00:14:04,804
Because the other thing that always drove me nuts about

319
00:14:04,815 --> 00:14:08,645
this is I use a thing that has a dependency chain

320
00:14:08,835 --> 00:14:12,585
and I can't tweak that dependency chain without horrifically breaking it.

321
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,284
Yeah, 100%. That's right.

322
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:18,325
My question I'm always wondering about is what does harm reduction look like. And so

323
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,159
uh a great example is,

324
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,090
well,

325
00:14:21,369 --> 00:14:24,090
what if you get your devs to ship the product once or

326
00:14:24,099 --> 00:14:28,150
twice a week as part of the normal just getting features out?

327
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,169
And now that means you have the capability of getting a security fix

328
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:33,630
out a lot quicker than if you only ship once a quarter.

329
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,390
Not necessarily, that's not true at all. OK? So I've got a great example of this.

330
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:42,070
I have a project I created that uses React. OK?

331
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,570
And I did the end,

332
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,770
there's a tool called NPX which I don't even know what that stands for.

333
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,000
But it, it will like

334
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,299
I could type like I think it's NPX something.

335
00:14:51,309 --> 00:14:55,570
React something and it creates the initial skeleton project for me. OK?

336
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,440
I create a React project.

337
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:02,010
This is using the, we'll say current latest accepted versions of

338
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,369
React stuff and

339
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,409
I build my project

340
00:15:06,859 --> 00:15:07,520
and

341
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:10,520
it installs 1500 dependencies.

342
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:14,960
And there are warnings from some of the dependencies that say things like this

343
00:15:14,969 --> 00:15:18,159
dependency is deprecated and it is going to stop working in the future.

344
00:15:18,349 --> 00:15:21,809
Like those are literally warnings when I do this. Now.

345
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,119
If you are a project, it doesn't matter if you're deploying multiple times a day,

346
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,299
you need to be upgrading everything constantly,

347
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:30,880
but you can't upgrade everything because everything is hidden behind

348
00:15:30,969 --> 00:15:34,650
the 12 react packages that and turn into 1500 reactions.

349
00:15:34,695 --> 00:15:36,715
Think well, yeah, react to stuff.

350
00:15:36,724 --> 00:15:40,784
And so even if you say we're going to deploy once a day that guarantees nothing.

351
00:15:40,794 --> 00:15:41,955
No, no, that's

352
00:15:42,085 --> 00:15:43,244
not the point I was trying to make

353
00:15:43,354 --> 00:15:45,645
the point I'm trying to make is I'm trying to get

354
00:15:45,655 --> 00:15:49,825
my devs to build capabilities that actually benefit us beyond security

355
00:15:49,974 --> 00:15:50,515
so that

356
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:53,544
it potentially has a security benefit.

357
00:15:53,645 --> 00:15:57,955
It could selling people. I want to spend a million dollars a year

358
00:15:58,085 --> 00:16:00,025
to go from a quarterly deployment of the software

359
00:16:00,034 --> 00:16:02,455
to a monthly deployment of the software for security.

360
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,315
You will not get that million dollars.

361
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:09,140
I want to spend a million dollars to get our quarterly deployments down

362
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:13,599
to monthly deployments so we can get features out to paying customers faster.

363
00:16:13,609 --> 00:16:15,739
-- Oh, now we're having a discussion
-- maybe.

364
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,559
-- I mean, a million dollars is still a lot
-- but,

365
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,640
but they're not going to say no right off the bat.

366
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,280
Right. That's fair. That's fair. They might say no later on.

367
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:22,840
But

368
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:25,179
there's now the potential for a discussion and,

369
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,130
and that's the kind of thing I'm talking about is like, I, I think about

370
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:31,419
natural disasters and stuff and for example, the electrical system,

371
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:34,559
we no longer have all these extra repair crews

372
00:16:34,859 --> 00:16:37,479
where when you have hurricanes down in the US,

373
00:16:37,489 --> 00:16:39,739
you have repair crews from Canada going down,

374
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,570
right? You kind of have these mutual aid agreements.

375
00:16:42,859 --> 00:16:44,849
And so the theory is, well, hopefully,

376
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:45,599
you know, in the,

377
00:16:45,609 --> 00:16:48,969
in the summer we have hurricanes in the US and in winter we have ice storms in Canada.

378
00:16:48,979 --> 00:16:50,650
So in winter when there's ice storms in Canada,

379
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:53,080
we literally had repair crews from like Texas.

380
00:16:53,349 --> 00:16:55,729
But thank you. It's, it's a heck of a drive

381
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,500
and it's chilly. So bring some warm clothes and, you know, we got you some sandwiches

382
00:17:01,099 --> 00:17:01,630
and, uh,

383
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,599
that's a more efficient way of doing it and

384
00:17:03,609 --> 00:17:05,810
trying to get an electrical company to be like,

385
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,069
oh, we'll just have 10% more repair crews, you know,

386
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,410
just in case for hurricane season,

387
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:12,749
-- that's not gonna happen. No,
-- no, for sure.

388
00:17:12,828 --> 00:17:12,868
But

389
00:17:13,428 --> 00:17:15,739
you know what, let's build a mutual aid

390
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:18,779
pact society across North America

391
00:17:18,979 --> 00:17:22,659
-- that has worked.
-- I want you to tie this to Open SSF scorecard.

392
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:27,259
-- It goes
-- back to harm reduction. Open SSF is that historical of this project? Score

393
00:17:27,654 --> 00:17:29,043
seven or Flipper

394
00:17:29,384 --> 00:17:32,433
Gibbet or green or blue? Like, I don't even know what these numbers mean.

395
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:35,313
Right. That's, yeah, that's, that's part of it. No one knows.

396
00:17:35,323 --> 00:17:38,443
There are also some projects where it's like, oh, they don't have a test framework.

397
00:17:38,553 --> 00:17:38,933
Well,

398
00:17:39,244 --> 00:17:41,053
does that really matter if it's like a

399
00:17:41,213 --> 00:17:44,354
thing called American date that converts a date to an American date format?

400
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:50,199
No, I right. Like it matters for G zip and Tar Absolutely.

401
00:17:50,209 --> 00:17:53,140
You need to have a horrific set of tests to make

402
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:56,079
sure you don't get all these weird bypasses in theory.

403
00:17:56,089 --> 00:17:56,560
I mean,

404
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:57,359
that's the thing.

405
00:17:57,369 --> 00:18:00,869
What does the scorecard even mean the thing I've never seen with the Os SF

406
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,420
is they don't actually do they give concrete advice on if the score is this,

407
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,579
then you need to do this?

408
00:18:06,589 --> 00:18:07,040
Yes.

409
00:18:07,569 --> 00:18:08,339
Oh, they do.

410
00:18:08,349 --> 00:18:11,780
No, not, not in the sense of what the project needs to do, but the user needs to,

411
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,469
-- there's nothing for users, there's nothing users can do.
-- That's what I'm saying.

412
00:18:15,479 --> 00:18:15,729
Like,

413
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:19,420
like they don't say if it scores below 20 never use the software.

414
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,939
No, they just say this is a 20

415
00:18:21,189 --> 00:18:22,739
here's what you can do to increase the score.

416
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,239
-- But, and that's the thing, you can't give that advice.
-- Here's the other part of it.

417
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,199
That's really funny is most of the major

418
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:32,300
security events of the last probably 20 years

419
00:18:32,489 --> 00:18:33,280
were in

420
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:36,449
projects that would have scored relatively high at

421
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,780
scorecard because the reality is they're well used

422
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:42,400
project like Log for J was in everything.

423
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:46,900
-- Log for J didn't have an amazing score, but they did a lot of stuff.
-- Right.

424
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,469
Well, it's just a part of a basic maturity.

425
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:50,290
It's, and see that thing,

426
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:54,939
it's not even security so much as just basic maturity of using C I CD pipelines.

427
00:18:54,949 --> 00:18:59,060
-- Having tests, having a bug reporter.
-- Here's what I really want to know and no one's

428
00:18:59,165 --> 00:19:01,954
on this yet that I'm aware of, take all these scores

429
00:19:02,155 --> 00:19:08,185
and then look at like how much effort have these projects created

430
00:19:08,204 --> 00:19:12,165
or how many problems have these projects created based upon the score.

431
00:19:12,175 --> 00:19:14,795
My suspicion is the higher scoring a project is

432
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:19,425
the more impactful security vulnerabilities in an RT organization.

433
00:19:19,435 --> 00:19:22,084
And so I think it's the inverse of it's easy to

434
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,704
say projects with low scores are bad for me to run

435
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,640
when

436
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:28,989
they're probably not good for a variety of reasons.

437
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:32,699
But I have a suspicion the score is completely irrelevant

438
00:19:32,979 --> 00:19:36,689
-- in the context we think it matters in.
-- Let's take it to its logical extreme.

439
00:19:36,699 --> 00:19:39,599
How would Microsoft and their software development

440
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:41,459
practices generally score with an OS F

441
00:19:41,709 --> 00:19:44,319
scorecard? Well, basically 100% because

442
00:19:44,569 --> 00:19:46,770
do they have a security team? Oh, yeah,

443
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,079
they have blue team, red team. They, they have a,

444
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:51,569
they have their own conference.

445
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:52,650
Right. Like,

446
00:19:52,939 --> 00:19:55,339
they have a leader board of all the people finding bugs in

447
00:19:55,349 --> 00:19:58,709
their products and yet Windows is still cranking out Microsoft Tuesday.

448
00:19:58,890 --> 00:19:59,189
Yeah.

449
00:19:59,430 --> 00:19:59,709
Right.

450
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:03,630
And is it, you know, are, windows, are some of these windows bugs impactful? Yeah.

451
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,459
A little bit.

452
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,660
That's just it.

453
00:20:07,829 --> 00:20:10,839
That's what, that's what amuses me over things like this is

454
00:20:10,979 --> 00:20:13,280
what value do these scores bring?

455
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:16,119
Now, I see this all the time though, where you talk to a company,

456
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,800
you talk to someone that's

457
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:19,760
looking to use open source.

458
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:23,630
They want like source composition analysis and they've heard that

459
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,439
we should be rating our open source or we'll,

460
00:20:27,449 --> 00:20:30,630
we'll tie this into, we should know what countries

461
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,739
the developers are from that that are writing this open source, right?

462
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,150
Like these are things we want to know

463
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,229
and

464
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,839
-- the question
-- kind of,

465
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,819
I want a pony that's house stream, but we don't get what you want.

466
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:45,540
No. Look, you can kind of OK,

467
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:51,050
-- we'll, we'll get to that in a second. Let's just
-- ignore the gross GDPR violation.

468
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,619
That would be knowing where your source code comes from.

469
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,829
Well, not exactly, it's complicated. OK.

470
00:20:57,569 --> 00:20:58,569
Here's what they want,

471
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,920
here's what they actually want. OK?

472
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:02,989
OK. First of all, let's touch on the idea of like

473
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,586
there are these scores, do they matter?

474
00:21:05,706 --> 00:21:07,576
We don't know, we think they might,

475
00:21:07,745 --> 00:21:11,816
this is where we get into the issue of an enormous amount

476
00:21:11,826 --> 00:21:15,855
of what we're calling security today is what I call crap,

477
00:21:15,865 --> 00:21:17,855
a smart person thought was a good idea.

478
00:21:17,865 --> 00:21:23,816
There is no foundational research or proof into an enormous

479
00:21:23,826 --> 00:21:25,686
amount of what we do is scoring open source.

480
00:21:25,696 --> 00:21:29,215
A good idea. I, I can't say it is or isn't, does it seem like a good idea?

481
00:21:29,352 --> 00:21:31,102
It absolutely does. Is it?

482
00:21:31,232 --> 00:21:32,102
I don't know.

483
00:21:32,202 --> 00:21:37,371
So one comment you don't need foundational research to, to say if this is good or bad.

484
00:21:37,531 --> 00:21:39,531
But what we should be doing is like you said,

485
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,671
taking all these scores and all these projects

486
00:21:42,121 --> 00:21:45,651
lining them up against all the vulnerabilities and saying like, well,

487
00:21:45,661 --> 00:21:46,771
did this help or not?

488
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:49,822
So some things I would argue are

489
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:54,612
like having a source code repo that is public is probably very good for security.

490
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:58,000
Can I prove it? Well, I would have to do a bunch of research

491
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:58,339
and

492
00:21:58,479 --> 00:21:59,229
I can't be bothered

493
00:21:59,959 --> 00:21:59,989
and,

494
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:03,780
but the thing is you don't need foundational research to figure out like, oh,

495
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,979
we're gonna, you know, here's the medicine we need to use.

496
00:22:05,989 --> 00:22:08,819
What you can do is OK. Well, here's a population.

497
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,400
Half of them wash their hands with soap,

498
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,979
half of them don't who gets more sick on average.

499
00:22:12,989 --> 00:22:15,060
Oh, the people who don't wash their hands with soap. Ok.

500
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:16,900
So washing hands with soap appears to

501
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:19,689
and there's the problem though, there's correlation.

502
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,209
-- You don't know that it's causative though.
-- That's right.

503
00:22:22,219 --> 00:22:25,969
Like, oh the people who wash their hands live near the pump full of cholera,

504
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:30,189
washing your hands makes you more sick. Everyone,

505
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,819
the people washing their hands with soap, live in a

506
00:22:32,939 --> 00:22:34,979
big enough city to have a soap store.

507
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:35,569
Right.

508
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,650
-- Exactly. Exactly.
-- And thus public sanitation.

509
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:39,849
Right. And that's the thing. Like

510
00:22:40,329 --> 00:22:44,790
it's, I, I feel like it would be really tough to find correlation

511
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,670
between some of these things. And

512
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,630
I think so again, this is why I go back to the well, are there reasons I can sell this

513
00:22:51,949 --> 00:22:52,859
that are not security?

514
00:22:52,869 --> 00:22:56,660
So for example, having a testing framework so that not for security,

515
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,709
but just so we break stuff less often and more importantly.

516
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:03,180
So you can confidently make changes to the software

517
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,369
and and

518
00:23:04,699 --> 00:23:05,859
not break stuff

519
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,239
because that thing, once you have a really good testing framework,

520
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,550
you can add features like a

521
00:23:09,949 --> 00:23:11,979
chimpanzee on drugs

522
00:23:12,229 --> 00:23:14,560
and know if it's gonna make it worse or better.

523
00:23:15,109 --> 00:23:18,420
That's our new name for A I now, right? Chimpanzee on drugs.

524
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:18,849
Basically,

525
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:19,859
it's what it is

526
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:21,310
hard,

527
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:22,420
it just doesn't,

528
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:23,319
you

529
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,339
-- know.
-- OK. OK.

530
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:24,920
Hold on.

531
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,989
Yes, I think you are correct. And I think

532
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:33,069
the challenge you see with something like scorecard is today,

533
00:23:33,489 --> 00:23:38,209
the value in it is viewed almost exclusively as security.

534
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:41,500
This harkens itself back to the I think I talked about this a

535
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:45,219
couple episodes ago when I went to the open source summit in Vancouver,

536
00:23:45,229 --> 00:23:49,829
I went to a salsa talk where where people will make claims,

537
00:23:50,045 --> 00:23:54,275
extraordinary claims about some of these frameworks and some of these projects

538
00:23:54,415 --> 00:23:59,395
and the reality is you can't back that up at all. And I think these claims are

539
00:23:59,545 --> 00:24:01,224
probably dangerous.

540
00:24:01,425 --> 00:24:02,064
All right. All right.

541
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:04,454
I want to move us on to the last bit, which is the,

542
00:24:04,464 --> 00:24:06,625
who is writing the software you're using?

543
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:09,770
-- And there's two pieces
-- to this. They're all signed off, commits. It's fine.

544
00:24:09,969 --> 00:24:11,459
They declared that they wrote it. It's all

545
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:11,699
good.

546
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:12,060
Yeah.

547
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,699
No, for real. Ok.

548
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,319
So from the legal perspective, basically,

549
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:21,189
what's being asked is does anyone with a.cn email address

550
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,410
-- committed to this?
-- They all have qq.com email addresses.

551
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:28,579
This this actually comes up a lot on the certificate authority mailing list,

552
00:24:28,589 --> 00:24:31,660
for example, basically, apparently nobody from China can email Google

553
00:24:32,479 --> 00:24:33,640
Bliss and vice versa.

554
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,079
Yeah. So they all use like

555
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,250
Wonky gmail.com accounts. Oh,

556
00:24:37,469 --> 00:24:39,800
so they're literally using Gmail.

557
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:45,280
So you basically have no good way to determine if this person is from.

558
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,969
That's the thing I keep bringing up and they're like, oh, ok, shut up. It's fine.

559
00:24:47,979 --> 00:24:48,400
And I'm like,

560
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,400
this is some random like literally there are

561
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,614
gmail addresses on the certificate authority mailing list

562
00:24:52,885 --> 00:24:55,655
that have zero occurrences in Google search.

563
00:24:55,905 --> 00:24:57,364
So I didn't know this.

564
00:24:57,385 --> 00:25:01,895
So this is why those cas aren't mailing that list with their email

565
00:25:01,905 --> 00:25:05,074
address because their email address can't get to where it needs to go.

566
00:25:05,084 --> 00:25:05,655
You're saying,

567
00:25:05,854 --> 00:25:07,665
I guess the great firewall of China or something

568
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:11,175
interesting. So, so ironically,

569
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:16,780
-- there's probably a low
-- now they're not spoofing it because every time it comes up,

570
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:19,530
they've managed to prove like by either putting in their Bugzilla entry or

571
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,969
one of them even said a DNS record saying like straight up this gmail.com account.

572
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,270
If you dig txt the C A, it's like this Gmail address is allowed to speak for us. OK?

573
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,089
But, but

574
00:25:30,339 --> 00:25:33,760
when we're talking about identifying country

575
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,939
of origin of open source contributions,

576
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:37,609
if many of the

577
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:41,719
contributors are using a gmail.com address,

578
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:46,420
it becomes significantly harder to I I mean, I had the assumption

579
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:48,910
that many of the Chinese

580
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:51,430
contributors were using.cn email.

581
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:53,910
The biggest, honestly, the biggest

582
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,670
Chinese email address provider you will generally see is the qq.com thing,

583
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:00,199
right? Where it's and it's their mobile number.

584
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,000
Ok,

585
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,560
qq.com, right?

586
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,439
Because when I first started seeing those I was

587
00:26:04,449 --> 00:26:06,250
like these are clearly spam sign up and then I

588
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:10,300
it's like no, this is like a legit Chinese mobile provider,

589
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,229
-- email address thing of a jigger, blah,
-- blah, blah.

590
00:26:12,619 --> 00:26:14,689
But no like that's an example where it

591
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:17,959
would be very easy to identify that contributor as

592
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:20,280
having China as their country of origin, right?

593
00:26:20,589 --> 00:26:21,680
If they have a random gmail,

594
00:26:22,145 --> 00:26:23,185
I can't do that right?

595
00:26:24,005 --> 00:26:24,344
You can

596
00:26:24,744 --> 00:26:25,665
you can maybe make,

597
00:26:25,675 --> 00:26:29,974
I mean they might say I'm from China in their their email signature or something.

598
00:26:30,224 --> 00:26:32,925
And then the question becomes like, ok, are we talking citizenship,

599
00:26:32,935 --> 00:26:36,175
country of origin, country of residence?

600
00:26:36,385 --> 00:26:37,734
Like these are all different things like,

601
00:26:37,744 --> 00:26:40,555
one thing I remember asking at the beginning of GDPR was like, ok,

602
00:26:40,564 --> 00:26:43,694
so GDPR applies to European citizens and they're like, correct.

603
00:26:43,704 --> 00:26:45,645
I'm like, ok, what about European citizens

604
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,689
going on vacation overseas?

605
00:26:47,849 --> 00:26:49,719
-- No,
-- it covers that stuff. It covers

606
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,079
anyone in Europe or European citizens.

607
00:26:52,089 --> 00:26:55,890
-- Does it cover me as a tourist in Europe for a week?
-- Yes. Yes. You're covered by that

608
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:59,709
-- the week I'm there or afterwards as
-- well. I don't know the answer to that.

609
00:26:59,959 --> 00:27:01,790
And that's where people like Kurt shut up. It's fine.

610
00:27:01,869 --> 00:27:04,650
-- I
-- mean, I bet the lawyers in Europe know the answer to this.

611
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,589
My suspicion is it still covers you.

612
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,770
-- But the
-- point is that's a relatively clean and clear example. Whereas

613
00:27:10,969 --> 00:27:15,140
what you actually want and this goes back to the show intro, 12 M 270

614
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,180
is

615
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:18,130
foreign agents

616
00:27:19,109 --> 00:27:21,369
because you could be a foreign agent for China

617
00:27:21,589 --> 00:27:23,479
and be born and bred in America

618
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:26,469
-- and
-- that happens all the time. And, and that's the point, right?

619
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:28,410
So here's the point of all of that.

620
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,170
If I am

621
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:36,939
a malicious actor and the intent fun functionally on all of this is

622
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:40,329
you have organizations wanting to identify,

623
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,880
where should we maybe look for malicious intent.

624
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,930
If I have malicious intent,

625
00:27:46,469 --> 00:27:49,900
I am not going to make any

626
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:51,500
contribution

627
00:27:51,739 --> 00:27:54,459
that makes it obvious. I am not like

628
00:27:54,619 --> 00:27:56,930
an American in the middle of America

629
00:27:57,099 --> 00:28:02,939
and I own a grill and I eat meat like I'm going to go out of my way to look like that.

630
00:28:02,969 --> 00:28:06,260
-- You're saying malicious actors might lie.
-- Exactly.

631
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,640
I don't think that's allowed because all the

632
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:08,109
signed off thing,

633
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:11,449
-- you have to set the evil bit in TCP.
-- If

634
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:11,579
you,

635
00:28:11,729 --> 00:28:14,760
this is the other thing that drives me nuts is essentially what they're saying is,

636
00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:18,260
or what they're trying to say is this pool of contributors from,

637
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:22,239
for the sake of argument, Canada is statistically safe

638
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:24,709
and this pool of contributors from China is

639
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:28,219
somehow not safe because of government influence,

640
00:28:28,229 --> 00:28:29,099
CCP whatever

641
00:28:29,229 --> 00:28:29,719
and

642
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,099
more to the point,

643
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:32,819
the potential contribute.

644
00:28:32,829 --> 00:28:36,680
The the potential value of the contributions from this pool of Chinese developers

645
00:28:36,989 --> 00:28:37,530
is

646
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:41,369
not worth running the risk of having an evil contribution.

647
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,660
Whereas implicitly this Canadian pool,

648
00:28:43,729 --> 00:28:47,969
the the value of contributions will be more than the potential of an evil actor.

649
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:48,969
And

650
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:53,250
this is just wrong on so many levels. I don't even know where to begin.

651
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:56,650
-- No, like I seriously don't know where to begin. We,
-- we can't begin.

652
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,599
I mean, we're, we're, we're running ourselves out of time.

653
00:28:58,609 --> 00:29:01,319
And so I don't want to dwell on it too long. I just want to point out the

654
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:03,630
utter absurdity and nonsense

655
00:29:03,819 --> 00:29:06,119
of this particular question.

656
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:08,479
-- The problem
-- is to somebody who says, well,

657
00:29:08,489 --> 00:29:10,579
but this works for like military technologies where

658
00:29:10,589 --> 00:29:13,239
we restrict crypto exports to these countries.

659
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,319
So they can't get a hold of this crypto, right?

660
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,959
That actually kind of did work for a few decades.

661
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:19,199
-- That
-- never worked.

662
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:21,400
-- No,
-- no, in the fifties and sixties I'm talking

663
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:21,760
about,

664
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,069
uh, when everything was hardware to a degree. Sure.

665
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:27,349
That's actually a really good statement when everything was hardware

666
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,609
and now it's software so I can just

667
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,989
make a copy of it and fire it off to China and they can run it on their own computer.

668
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,469
Yeah. I mean, I loved back in the,

669
00:29:35,689 --> 00:29:39,459
in the early two thousands, in the late nineties

670
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:40,680
when

671
00:29:40,939 --> 00:29:45,150
using Open SSL in the United States was illegal because of the RS A patent.

672
00:29:45,729 --> 00:29:49,260
And so me downloading and compiling the Apache web

673
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:53,140
server using Open SSL was technically against patent law.

674
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:57,369
OK. This is old timey story. This is 25 years ago, but I got hired as a contract

675
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:02,319
to assemble a portfolio of open source software for a CD the one in the back of a book.

676
00:30:02,329 --> 00:30:05,000
Yeah. Awesome. And I very explicitly

677
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:09,390
did not include anything with the RS, a patented algorithm. Yeah. And

678
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:12,510
oh my God, we spent two months arguing about that where I was like, no,

679
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:16,550
I look here's the list of stuff I, I can basically show you and it's all open.

680
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,619
And this is one of the few times where it's all open source.

681
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:21,599
I can actually prove to you that RS A algorithm is not in there.

682
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:21,800
And

683
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,069
the publisher,

684
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:24,750
it took a while for them to get over this

685
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,270
because II I included a couple of things that had crypto

686
00:30:28,589 --> 00:30:31,349
but did not have the RS, a patented algorithm in there.

687
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:32,930
And so

688
00:30:33,239 --> 00:30:36,050
the publisher was like, well crypto RS A obviously it,

689
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:40,339
-- I'm like, no, it's not in there again. Open source
-- here.

690
00:30:40,459 --> 00:30:42,949
It was probably covered by some other patent. It's fine.

691
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,790
Yeah. But anyway, it's,

692
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,989
that's a, that's a good comment is like,

693
00:30:47,209 --> 00:30:48,550
because with hardware,

694
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,329
I can't just make a copy of it by typing CP space blah, blah

695
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:55,260
work.

696
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,229
Yeah.

697
00:30:56,369 --> 00:30:58,900
I mean, here's the thing though. It never stopped.

698
00:30:59,229 --> 00:31:02,020
The other countries like Russia would get a

699
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,819
hold of everything and they would clone it,

700
00:31:03,869 --> 00:31:04,939
I mean, guaranteed

701
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:06,989
and, and shave it down and like,

702
00:31:07,489 --> 00:31:10,660
but the thing is you'd have to physically acquire one and you can do it harder,

703
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,680
you can do inventory management because some of the

704
00:31:12,689 --> 00:31:15,140
stuff is just again going away from security,

705
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:16,930
some of this stuff is just really expensive,

706
00:31:17,989 --> 00:31:18,439
you know. So,

707
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:23,239
like we might want to do inventory control in these $100 items and not be losing them.

708
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:23,709
Yeah.

709
00:31:23,979 --> 00:31:25,510
But going back to this. Yeah. And

710
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:26,219
it's

711
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,219
with respect to the bad actor problem.

712
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,310
The bad actors are going to do things like

713
00:31:32,729 --> 00:31:34,560
set up a Canadian persona.

714
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:39,489
Right. Oh, yeah, for sure. And setting up on a fake online persona is

715
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,660
easy

716
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,819
hijacking someone else's persona

717
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,619
is easy.

718
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,739
A perfect example on threads that Kurt

719
00:31:47,859 --> 00:31:49,260
Siefried is not me. It's,

720
00:31:49,369 --> 00:31:50,780
I'm pretty sure it's west coast Kurt

721
00:31:50,939 --> 00:31:53,420
-- siefried. Yeah,
-- you were complained about this in the last episode.

722
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:54,250
And so,

723
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,579
-- you know, like
-- you're not better.

724
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:00,530
-- Ok. So I wanna, I wanna, I wanna finish this one up.
-- I am the true Kurt

725
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:02,119
siefried. That is my position.

726
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:02,449
Well,

727
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:05,170
the real Kurt siefried, please stand up.

728
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:09,599
Anyway. Anyway. Oh, my goodness.

729
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:13,839
-- So I want to tie this one all up.
-- I hope he doesn't listen to the podcast. No.

730
00:32:13,939 --> 00:32:16,099
Yeah. Anyway, I want to tie this one all up. Ok.

731
00:32:16,339 --> 00:32:20,119
So first we have Red Hat then is open source dying.

732
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,599
And now kind of, I wanna, I wanna tie this up with the,

733
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:25,619
the measuring and scoring and use of open source.

734
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,920
And I think at the end of the day,

735
00:32:27,199 --> 00:32:30,290
none of this is going to matter for the foreseeable future because

736
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:34,890
the reality is open source is used by developers to solve problems

737
00:32:35,349 --> 00:32:37,719
and they don't give two craps what the open

738
00:32:37,729 --> 00:32:40,569
-- SSF scorecard is
-- because there's no alternative

739
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:40,689
in,

740
00:32:40,699 --> 00:32:42,130
in many cases there isn't.

741
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,270
And so what's going to happen is if I'm running a

742
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,010
tool that's going to score the open source in my product,

743
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:51,560
I might run the tool and I might say you're using a package that scored very low

744
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,449
and the developers, here's what, here's what,

745
00:32:53,459 --> 00:32:54,959
here's what the question is going to be.

746
00:32:54,969 --> 00:32:55,569
Ok?

747
00:32:55,579 --> 00:32:59,390
We can spend $250,000 to replace that with this

748
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,719
other package or we can ship the product tomorrow.

749
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,530
Guess what's going to win.

750
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,479
I mean, we did this a red hat,

751
00:33:05,709 --> 00:33:08,260
right? They acquired a company for over $100 million

752
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,689
and I'm like, ok,

753
00:33:09,699 --> 00:33:11,069
so we're shipping that software on the

754
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:12,790
date that you said we're shipping that software

755
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:15,810
and that's what happened regardless of any security concerns,

756
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:19,750
for sure, because I'm not stupid enough to say, like we're going to block this

757
00:33:20,849 --> 00:33:21,739
and, and that's the thing.

758
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,670
And so here's my suggestion to all of this is,

759
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:29,829
I think the scorecard has value but not in the way we think of it today.

760
00:33:29,979 --> 00:33:30,339
Yeah,

761
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:32,189
I think the value is in,

762
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:35,859
I I think of it as like observ ability where

763
00:33:35,869 --> 00:33:37,640
you can look at like your infrastructure and say,

764
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,209
oh why is this machine running hot?

765
00:33:39,219 --> 00:33:40,619
Is something wrong with that machine?

766
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:43,540
And I think it's the same thing with some of these scores is it's not

767
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:47,959
about like looking at an individual package and saying this package has a low score.

768
00:33:48,099 --> 00:33:52,780
It's about connecting all the dots and saying this area of our application

769
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:55,859
doesn't look real good. Why is that?

770
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:58,770
And then you can ask more fundamental questions about, oh,

771
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,300
this particular

772
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,979
piece of our application

773
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:03,709
isn't well maintained.

774
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:06,890
No one's looking at it like are, are do we need these features?

775
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,610
Can we just yank all this stuff and be rid of it?

776
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,909
Like are we, are we cutting off a rotten branch?

777
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,830
And I think those are the questions and that's the stuff we need to

778
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:18,360
start using these tools for instead of saying like one of my favorites,

779
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:23,120
someone will scan an application and be like, I'm a, I like this CV E needs to be fixed.

780
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:23,520
I'm like,

781
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:27,659
what does that CBE mean in the big picture? Like what do you mean? I'm like,

782
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:32,168
how can I get to that code to exploit it? Like what does that look like?

783
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:33,969
And they're like, I don't, I don't know.

784
00:34:33,978 --> 00:34:37,649
I'm like, maybe we should start asking bigger picture questions.

785
00:34:37,668 --> 00:34:40,728
I had this constantly with Jackson Data bind and satellite

786
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:44,280
where they did not use those binary de serialization things.

787
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:45,850
And I literally had

788
00:34:46,388 --> 00:34:47,967
a higher up at red hat say,

789
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:51,809
but you're saying the customer could modify the product to use that.

790
00:34:51,819 --> 00:34:52,638
And I'm like, well,

791
00:34:52,928 --> 00:34:53,188
they,

792
00:34:53,998 --> 00:34:54,368
I mean,

793
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:57,769
the source goes there, they could do that. And he's like, then we have to fix that.

794
00:34:57,779 --> 00:34:58,269
And I'm like,

795
00:34:58,909 --> 00:35:03,520
-- I cried,
-- look, I have a product that ships out to customers

796
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:08,489
and I look at the open. So I look at the vulnerability scans every day

797
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:12,020
-- and I just tell the developers just fix this crap because it's easier than
-- argument.

798
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,169
And that's sometimes what I ended up with.

799
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:16,469
Let's let's fix this cross site scripting because

800
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:18,889
-- it's cheaper.
-- Well, that's just it. My art

801
00:35:19,012 --> 00:35:21,072
isn't, this will make us more secure.

802
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:24,113
My argument is this will keep customers from bugging us.

803
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:27,883
-- It's cheaper than handling all the support requests.
-- Right. Exactly. Exactly.

804
00:35:27,893 --> 00:35:28,272
That.

805
00:35:28,562 --> 00:35:30,992
And so it's amusing to me that

806
00:35:31,193 --> 00:35:33,833
the vulnerabilities we fix in the product.

807
00:35:33,843 --> 00:35:36,762
I, I never make an argument about the security of it.

808
00:35:36,772 --> 00:35:39,193
I make the argument of this will keep people.

809
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:40,676
Ironically,

810
00:35:40,686 --> 00:35:44,176
it's one of the few times you can actually show a return on investment for that

811
00:35:44,406 --> 00:35:44,736
effect.

812
00:35:45,295 --> 00:35:45,335
But

813
00:35:45,466 --> 00:35:45,506
no,

814
00:35:45,706 --> 00:35:47,355
seriously, if it reduces support

815
00:35:47,656 --> 00:35:48,406
by 20

816
00:35:49,016 --> 00:35:49,055
that's

817
00:35:49,206 --> 00:35:49,345
real

818
00:35:50,176 --> 00:35:50,256
money.

819
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:51,805
100% 100%

820
00:35:52,486 --> 00:35:52,656
anyway.

821
00:35:53,035 --> 00:35:55,565
Well, and just to go sideways from it, this is one of the things

822
00:35:55,875 --> 00:35:59,486
where I'm focusing on our A I usage policy working group is not,

823
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:03,070
what is it that you want to do to kind of be quote unquote, more secure.

824
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,000
It's what do you want to do from an A I usage policy

825
00:36:06,169 --> 00:36:11,149
to sort of extract the maximum benefit from A I with sort of the least

826
00:36:11,739 --> 00:36:15,139
number of problems and risks and, and gross

827
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:18,620
and potential issues that come from that

828
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:23,439
and also keep things in line with like your, your organization's core values,

829
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:23,620
right?

830
00:36:23,629 --> 00:36:25,199
Because I straight up saying in the paper, like,

831
00:36:25,209 --> 00:36:29,689
we're not going to talk about the ethics and moral of, of A I replacing jobs.

832
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:32,199
But for some things,

833
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:37,425
having a human do, the work is part of the value like a Rolex watch.

834
00:36:37,784 --> 00:36:41,495
But Rolex watches are not mass produced because part

835
00:36:41,504 --> 00:36:43,995
of their whole thing is these are Rolex watches.

836
00:36:44,004 --> 00:36:46,905
They are made by craftsmen or craftswomen or people,

837
00:36:46,915 --> 00:36:49,925
basically people with a high degree of skill

838
00:36:50,354 --> 00:36:50,995
and they are,

839
00:36:51,324 --> 00:36:51,405
yeah,

840
00:36:52,024 --> 00:36:52,125
exactly.

841
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:53,850
And

842
00:36:53,959 --> 00:36:55,159
it's funny because

843
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:58,469
people are like, ok, yeah, we, we want to have an A I usage policy now to, like,

844
00:36:58,479 --> 00:37:02,199
extract the maximum benefit with and have as few problems as possible.

845
00:37:02,209 --> 00:37:02,989
Culturally

846
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:06,969
-- and as a side effect, they'll have slightly better security and less risk.
-- Cool.

847
00:37:06,979 --> 00:37:07,320
Maybe.

848
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:09,310
I mean, you know, well, you know, what's funny is,

849
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,729
I think if you have an open source

850
00:37:10,739 --> 00:37:13,270
usage policy it'll probably accomplish the same thing.

851
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:14,030
Yep.

852
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:14,879
You know.

853
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:17,850
Well, and see, and then, and that actually goes to the second thing I said,

854
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,590
which is you have three policy choices.

855
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,429
Basically no policy or anything is allowed run.

856
00:37:22,709 --> 00:37:25,580
And that's basically the open source policy at the CS A is like,

857
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,399
I just accept it like open sources here.

858
00:37:27,429 --> 00:37:30,439
-- And I think most people have that
-- second major

859
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:32,929
-- choice is just ban it out of
-- the question.

860
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,899
You can't do that even A I or open source. I don't think that's going to happen.

861
00:37:36,909 --> 00:37:38,340
You can do it.

862
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,020
But

863
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:40,810
unless you're in like some sort of regulated

864
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,389
industry or the government with no competition,

865
00:37:42,399 --> 00:37:43,570
it's probably not going to end well for

866
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,489
you because your competitors are probably going to

867
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,860
-- use these tools even that
-- your employees are going to do it and hide it.

868
00:37:47,879 --> 00:37:49,639
-- That's what's going to happen.
-- Exactly.

869
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:50,419
Yes.

870
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:53,820
And then of course, the third option is, is somewhere in that middle area

871
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:55,080
with nuance. And,

872
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:55,959
-- well,
-- you have to,

873
00:37:56,449 --> 00:37:59,239
that becomes a risk management discussion then where you have to say,

874
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,489
what do I consider an acceptable amount of risk?

875
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,969
And I think this is true of A I, this is true of open source.

876
00:38:03,979 --> 00:38:07,550
-- This is true of anything you do. This is true.
-- It's true of buying widgets,

877
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:11,610
-- Fred.
-- This is true of, of the food you stock in your cafeteria. Like

878
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:14,159
apparently the who is gonna declare Aspar

879
00:38:14,409 --> 00:38:18,399
-- as a cancer causing chemical
-- as Kurt holds up a diet Pepsi.

880
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,110
Yeah, it was very tasty

881
00:38:20,669 --> 00:38:21,629
as pertain.

882
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,310
I drink like five sodas a year.

883
00:38:24,949 --> 00:38:25,270
Yeah.

884
00:38:25,479 --> 00:38:27,489
-- So
-- I might have to just go strictly to coffee.

885
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,810
-- I don't
-- know that that's there you go, man.

886
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,149
So it's funny, you know why I switched to coffee when I was young

887
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:33,500
because

888
00:38:33,699 --> 00:38:35,500
Mountain Dew was expensive.

889
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:39,919
Coffee was cheaper and that, no, that left me with more beer money to go to the pub.

890
00:38:39,929 --> 00:38:44,429
Like my switch to coffee was strictly a cost

891
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,639
-- saving measure so I could buy more beer.
-- And that's,

892
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,479
that is literally what I'm talking about when I say make a harm reduction argument.

893
00:38:51,489 --> 00:38:51,770
A,

894
00:38:52,064 --> 00:38:54,004
an argument that your life will be better

895
00:38:54,425 --> 00:38:55,425
because no,

896
00:38:55,435 --> 00:38:59,175
seriously getting somebody telling somebody spend less money

897
00:38:59,185 --> 00:39:02,185
on aspartame laced pops because you'll get cancer.

898
00:39:02,294 --> 00:39:05,604
Nobody's going to care but spend less money on those pops. So you have more beer money

899
00:39:05,854 --> 00:39:07,084
that's gonna work with a lot of

900
00:39:07,314 --> 00:39:08,254
harm reduction.

901
00:39:08,925 --> 00:39:09,125
Yeah.

902
00:39:10,774 --> 00:39:11,165
Yeah.

903
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:14,199
-- Well, beer doesn't cause cancer cars. You
-- know,

904
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:18,439
cancer was the least of our concerns when, when you're 22 years old,

905
00:39:18,449 --> 00:39:20,020
spending your evenings in the

906
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:20,719
pub.

907
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,030
Yeah, exactly. So,

908
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,919
and I think maybe that's part of what security, see,

909
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:26,090
here's the thing that always drives me nuts is

910
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,540
security exists in the world and we always,

911
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,719
a lot of security people pretend like we're somehow

912
00:39:30,729 --> 00:39:33,469
so special and so unique that we exist separately

913
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,080
as we've learned from COVID.

914
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:38,959
Even the public health people are like, yeah, no, we can't make people back

915
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:39,629
like

916
00:39:40,139 --> 00:39:40,409
we,

917
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:41,770
we tried

918
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,489
and the harder you push, the more push back you get,

919
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,139
-- sometimes we
-- can't even get people to cough into their, you know,

920
00:39:48,149 --> 00:39:49,699
vampire cough into their arm.

921
00:39:49,949 --> 00:39:50,310
Right?

922
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,080
The vampire

923
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:52,000
cough. That's a good name. You

924
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,590
cover your face, look, you're a vampire

925
00:39:55,989 --> 00:39:59,189
-- and cough into your, the crook of your elbow
-- anyway. All right. All right.

926
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:01,149
I'm gonna call this one because we're dragging on. But,

927
00:40:01,489 --> 00:40:04,229
yep, yep. OK. I think we're in a good place. Thank you, Kurt.

928
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:05,379
Thank you very much for listening. Go to

929
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,010
social security podcast.com. Head of our show.

930
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:07,550
It's Easy Podos

931
00:40:07,919 --> 00:40:11,219
Podcast. Hashtag on Mastodon. I don't, I don't know how to end it now,

932
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,090
-- I
-- guess, you know what, for bonus points?

933
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,949
Can somebody tell us what NPX means because I

934
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:16,959
was googling it while the show was going on.

935
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,709
And as far as I can tell NPX doesn't

936
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:23,000
stand for anything other than NP executable,

937
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:25,409
but I'm not finding the acronym anywhere

938
00:40:26,399 --> 00:40:30,600
N PM. Is N PM package manager. So I'm assuming NPX is the execution.

939
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:31,530
Ok.

940
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,330
Um

941
00:40:32,979 --> 00:40:38,449
package named NPX. It says NPX execute N PM package binaries.

942
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:42,250
But what does does that? Is that all NPX means is N PM package execution?

943
00:40:42,459 --> 00:40:45,320
So anyways for bonus points, tell us what the heck it means, please. Thank you

944
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:46,560
unmasked

945
00:40:46,709 --> 00:40:46,929
on

946
00:40:47,209 --> 00:40:49,080
-- and
-- then you'll have to report your foreign contact.

947
00:40:51,969 --> 00:40:54,020
Kurt have a marvelous rest of your day.

948
00:40:54,129 --> 00:40:57,060
-- You too. Thanks everybody. Thanks
-- everyone. Bye bye.

949
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,560
Oh, my goodness.
