00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:05,739
Hello.

1
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,630
And welcome to episode 43 of the open source security podcast with myself,

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,180
Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime.

3
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:11,960
Josh Bresser.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,119
What's new Kurt?

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,030
-- Well, shadow brokers is at it again. Oh, my
-- goodness. That's,

6
00:00:17,229 --> 00:00:20,909
this is madness. That was. What day was that? Was that Friday or Thursday?

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:26,510
They released a whole bunch of stuff and it's, it's crazy town now because

8
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:32,279
it's not just that they found a bunch of security issues, it's that this is, well,

9
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,909
they didn't find them, we say they acquired them

10
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,310
but it's all weaponized stuff.

11
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:40,319
So, pretty much anyone with an internet connection can put these to use,

12
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,830
which is terrifying to pretty much anyone

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,799
who does any sort of operational security.

14
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:48,330
Well, and I mean, some of these vulnerabilities go back.

15
00:00:48,669 --> 00:00:52,459
Uh, I think, what was it? Windows? What version of it was?

16
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,509
It was, it's a version of Windows. It's like more than 10 years old at this point.

17
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,290
-- Yeah, they go back quite a long ways.
-- Yeah.

18
00:00:58,419 --> 00:01:00,090
And, and what gets me is it wasn't always,

19
00:01:00,099 --> 00:01:02,849
it's not just the sort of technical phones which let's face it.

20
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,919
You know, people can do technical phones all day long. Great.

21
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,080
But there's like the operational sort of side of stuff that's apparently in there,

22
00:01:09,089 --> 00:01:11,290
like, um, apparently there's a whole bunch of stuff

23
00:01:11,589 --> 00:01:14,360
about the banking system. And so the,

24
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:17,150
the thinking is essentially that the NSA has been, you know,

25
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,620
knee deep in the various parts of the world banking system, I guess.

26
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,169
-- Nothing, keeping tabs
-- on

27
00:01:22,779 --> 00:01:23,139
me,

28
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,779
literally nothing.

29
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:28,239
Well, see, that's what always guts me about crime is like,

30
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,389
and this even goes back to Al Capone, like, follow the money,

31
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,139
right? Because

32
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:34,599
no fundamentally, you know,

33
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:38,449
criminals either at some point they have to interact with money,

34
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:41,519
they need money to buy stuff or to bribe people or to whatever.

35
00:01:41,529 --> 00:01:41,870
Right.

36
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:43,800
And, you know,

37
00:01:43,809 --> 00:01:47,360
we're not going to be shipping large duffel bags of cash around internationally.

38
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,500
You would be surprised.

39
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,279
True. But, I mean, it's, you know, but these people use the banking system,

40
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,000
you know.

41
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:55,650
Yes.

42
00:01:55,889 --> 00:01:59,690
And uh, it's at some point they also maybe have to interface with legitimate,

43
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:01,449
you know, companies and people, you know,

44
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:04,959
who aren't going to take a duffel bag full of cash for that truck

45
00:02:05,669 --> 00:02:07,540
-- or
-- whatever, you know, for what it's worth.

46
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:11,169
I'm not even going to speculate on what purpose

47
00:02:11,619 --> 00:02:12,770
it could possibly need

48
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:13,970
and, and that's ok.

49
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:14,509
It, it

50
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,899
is what it is,

51
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:17,369
right? We'll just say that.

52
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:19,649
-- So
-- what gets me about this though is that there's,

53
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,929
there's no real easy silver bullet good way to deal with, you know,

54
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:26,669
the the disclosure of these vulnerabilities, right?

55
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:30,119
Like, and you know, obviously the NSA isn't the only people with this kind of stuff.

56
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,460
Ok. Ok. There,

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,839
that's part of the story.

58
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:34,720
There's,

59
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,740
I can see a couple of things here is, first of all,

60
00:02:38,179 --> 00:02:40,320
every organization on the planet

61
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:41,350
is

62
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:42,800
compromised.

63
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:43,479
Ok.

64
00:02:43,619 --> 00:02:44,309
Let's start there.

65
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,619
Anyone who thinks that,

66
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,800
that the US hasn't infiltrated every other country and every

67
00:02:48,809 --> 00:02:51,520
other country hasn't infiltrated the US is fooling themselves.

68
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:56,479
And historically speaking, these organizations acquire

69
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:01,389
stuff, we'll say be it, um, intelligence of some manner and they don't release it

70
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,559
because you don't want to.

71
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,380
And so the shadow brokers obviously are, they're, they're part of some game.

72
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:09,570
It's not that they're just like some guys who

73
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,490
found some stuff and now they're releasing it.

74
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,070
And so that part is terrifying

75
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,490
in, in many ways.

76
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,369
But then there's also the,

77
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,809
the idea of the exploit and here's the thing that always gets good exploits and,

78
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,610
and you're familiar with this concept as well is

79
00:03:23,089 --> 00:03:28,289
it is very common for an exploit to be found by two people at the same time,

80
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,500
which means

81
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,429
a and these organizations know this, right?

82
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,050
These guys aren't dumb, they know what's up.

83
00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:38,369
So they know their adversaries probably have the same stuff they do.

84
00:03:39,779 --> 00:03:40,070
Well.

85
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,570
And the other thing too is, is I'm,

86
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,020
I'm hesitant to read in like these grand global

87
00:03:44,029 --> 00:03:46,589
conspiracies when it could just be like simple,

88
00:03:46,619 --> 00:03:47,889
you know, somebody screwed up.

89
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,669
Oh, somebody screwed up. They, somebody certainly screwed up.

90
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:53,270
But there's also a certain amount of

91
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:56,070
global conspiracy involved here without question.

92
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,520
But, and I mean, here's what really gets me is, is the real

93
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,949
brutal truth of this is, is, this is not hard stuff.

94
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,110
This is not like building a nuclear bomb in 1945.

95
00:04:08,369 --> 00:04:10,429
You know, this is literally one,

96
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,750
you know, one

97
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,619
smart guy who knows how to use the internet and maybe has a couple of $1000 for,

98
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,040
you know,

99
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:17,260
a, a

100
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:19,809
reasonably decent laptop. And, um,

101
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:22,010
honestly, I can only think of like,

102
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,519
there's only maybe one or two software packages that you actually have

103
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:26,700
to pay money for the rest of it's all open source,

104
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,130
you know, and there's online tutorials, there's, I mean, heck,

105
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:32,809
there's even books on this for, you know, developing these exploits.

106
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,720
-- I want you to
-- clarify this.

107
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,589
Are you saying exploit development is easy or are you saying

108
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,950
-- I'm
-- saying it's easy in the context of like,

109
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,829
compared to developing a nuclear weapon or, you know, putting a man on the moon,

110
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:48,070
you know what I mean? Like it's, it's not easy like making a loaf of bread,

111
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,269
right? It's actually, it's harder. Ok. So

112
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,790
you

113
00:04:53,109 --> 00:04:54,190
in your basement

114
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,549
can develop exploits very cheaply,

115
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,649
but a clandestine organization cannot, because they need infrastructure,

116
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,709
they need things in place.

117
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,630
It's actually very, very expensive.

118
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:06,269
Well, yeah, and at that level, that sort of industrial level.

119
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,140
Yeah, they would have a lot of controls, they'd have, you know,

120
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:11,040
security to make sure it doesn't walk out the door, stuff like that.

121
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,390
But fundamentally it's still, you know, it's

122
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:15,959
millions of dollars,

123
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,260
-- maybe tens of millions. It's a
-- lot,

124
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:19,359
it's a lot of

125
00:05:19,489 --> 00:05:19,720
money.

126
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,970
And in the grand scheme of a major government though, that's not a lot of money.

127
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,070
That's fair.

128
00:05:24,429 --> 00:05:24,869
You know.

129
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,989
Anyway. Anyway, let's

130
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:32,290
let, let's, let's back this one up because I'd rather not get too deep in the weeds on,

131
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:33,470
on how all this works.

132
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,010
But I, I think what I would like to talk about are some of the,

133
00:05:37,329 --> 00:05:39,670
the themes that have come out of this.

134
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:43,290
And my favorite so far has been the people on Twitter saying, oh,

135
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,170
the shadow brokers exploits were patched in,

136
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,190
in one of the previous Microsoft patch.

137
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,559
Tuesdays just upgrade Windows.

138
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:55,019
And I laugh hysterically at that because that's like saying

139
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,839
just stop being poor, you know, it's easy.

140
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,750
This is one of the reasons I, I actually, I, I am,

141
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,489
I have an M CS E A Microsoft Certified Systems

142
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,119
Engineer uh thing from back in the NT four days

143
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,739
and I did all those exams and I actually almost got my M CS E plus internet,

144
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,279
but I didn't.

145
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:12,760
And,

146
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:17,920
and I quickly realized that being on the operational end of windows was a nightmare

147
00:06:19,269 --> 00:06:19,369
back

148
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:19,589
-- in
-- the

149
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:22,000
end of anything is a nightmare.

150
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:22,799
Linux

151
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:23,350
Linux,

152
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,750
like I, this is one of the reasons I chose. Linux is.

153
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,160
Linux is slightly less nightmarish in the sense

154
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,079
of like getting it up and running and,

155
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,000
you know, so on is kind of a pain in the butt.

156
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,040
But once you get it up and running, it tends to stay

157
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,040
up and running.

158
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,649
That's fair.

159
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,179
That's fair.

160
00:06:36,369 --> 00:06:37,350
You know, whereas windows,

161
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:41,109
you can actually get it up and running pretty quick and then just something happens

162
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,510
and then you have to,

163
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:46,170
-- you have to click the mouse 10 million times to solve your problem.
-- Yeah.

164
00:06:46,179 --> 00:06:49,429
And, and it's just totally random stuff like DLL S just

165
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:51,309
like, literally, I remember like,

166
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,000
like just an important DLL on the server just went missing

167
00:06:54,299 --> 00:06:55,040
just gone. Of course,

168
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:55,380
it did.

169
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:56,339
Nobody knows,

170
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,750
you know. And you know, so,

171
00:06:58,864 --> 00:06:59,325
I mean,

172
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:02,295
yeah, then we enable, you know, auditing and logging and it's, yeah,

173
00:07:02,304 --> 00:07:04,225
we still have no idea why stuff breaks or

174
00:07:04,345 --> 00:07:06,404
we know why it breaks it because this, you know,

175
00:07:06,415 --> 00:07:08,355
third party app that's garbage does it.

176
00:07:08,364 --> 00:07:10,054
But we have to have that third party app

177
00:07:10,065 --> 00:07:11,924
because the accountants need it or whatever anyways.

178
00:07:11,934 --> 00:07:13,595
So I quickly, no, out of that.

179
00:07:13,744 --> 00:07:14,304
Um,

180
00:07:14,404 --> 00:07:16,274
because it was just so so painful.

181
00:07:16,524 --> 00:07:19,105
But, um, yeah, that's the thing like, so you're basically trading.

182
00:07:19,614 --> 00:07:22,934
It's, it's a nonzero chance that you'll get hacked by these bad guys.

183
00:07:23,214 --> 00:07:26,135
But there's also a nonzero chance that in the update you're gonna like,

184
00:07:26,144 --> 00:07:27,665
horribly wreck something.

185
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,619
And quite honestly that non zero chance for the wrecking

186
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,510
stuff is a lot higher than the being hacked.

187
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:37,660
-- One. Typically,
-- it very well might be. And not just that

188
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,519
a lot of organizations have clearly defined

189
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:43,119
policies on doing things like updates and doing

190
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:47,320
an out of band update is nontrivial to say the least not counting the fact

191
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:50,399
that you could be talking about thousands or tens

192
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,010
of thousands of machines that need to be updated,

193
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:56,670
which even if you said let's update them all right now,

194
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:00,890
you can't update them all at the same time because things have to reboot.

195
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:04,750
Things need passwords typed in it. It's insane how this all works.

196
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,670
And then it,

197
00:08:05,864 --> 00:08:08,184
that's even worse because you might not have a big fleet of machines,

198
00:08:08,195 --> 00:08:13,524
but that fleet of machines might be controlling an oil refinery or a train system.

199
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:14,424
You know, I mean,

200
00:08:14,434 --> 00:08:17,785
I know for a fact that there are companies out there running railroads

201
00:08:18,024 --> 00:08:21,845
and their policy is we have a yearly update cycle and then we do non,

202
00:08:21,855 --> 00:08:24,045
or we do criticals as needed.

203
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:27,750
But otherwise we have like a yearly patch cycle and it's like

204
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:31,649
that it's, it's running a major North American railroad. Like, you can't just

205
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,049
not have that working for four hours.

206
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,010
-- Yeah, mi minor
-- detail. You know,

207
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,869
like, like those airports that, you know,

208
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,650
every time the computers glitch out at the

209
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:42,840
airport and like the entire airport shut down,

210
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:44,770
not only does that airport lose a ton of money,

211
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,849
but the airlines and then there's that ripple effect, right?

212
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,770
Like all the, all the incoming and outgoing flights that are, like,

213
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,559
totally messed up.

214
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,010
And I remember somebody, I don't know if you saw it.

215
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,969
They did a really beautiful animated gif

216
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:58,099
of an incident at Heathrow and like the shock waves as it rippled around the world,

217
00:08:58,109 --> 00:09:00,330
kind of like to all the other airports and stuff and it was,

218
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,539
it was kind of horrifying but also quite pretty

219
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:06,419
your inability to pronounce GIF correctly has put me,

220
00:09:07,869 --> 00:09:09,169
it's not a GIF, it's AJ,

221
00:09:09,989 --> 00:09:13,460
-- sorry, I'm Canadian. We tend to pronounce it with a hard
-- g, you're wrong.

222
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,510
I accept that just

223
00:09:15,869 --> 00:09:16,010
like

224
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,750
ZNZ.

225
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:22,289
So, anyway, yes, I, I've seen, actually, I've been affected by this more than once.

226
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:23,109
Is

227
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:27,880
o'hare one time had their, I guess their server room lit on fire,

228
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:28,289
I was

229
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:28,679
told

230
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:30,599
and whatever that means, ok.

231
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,429
And

232
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:34,645
I have visions of actual flames, which I'm sure it was.

233
00:09:34,955 --> 00:09:38,515
Well, the problem is even a small fire but if the water suppression system kicks in

234
00:09:38,655 --> 00:09:40,695
and, right, and that's kind of what I think.

235
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:41,994
Right is a fire suppression,

236
00:09:42,005 --> 00:09:44,955
fire suppression system probably messed everything up.

237
00:09:44,965 --> 00:09:45,414
But anyway,

238
00:09:45,424 --> 00:09:49,755
this is a place that I think was landing a plane every 30 seconds or something.

239
00:09:49,765 --> 00:09:50,905
Maybe even more than that.

240
00:09:51,335 --> 00:09:51,955
And

241
00:09:52,315 --> 00:09:53,195
the, the

242
00:09:53,364 --> 00:09:56,104
airline people I was talking to because I was talking to the gate agent kind

243
00:09:56,114 --> 00:10:00,474
of about what's going on here because I was waiting for a plane coming from Chicago

244
00:10:00,859 --> 00:10:03,400
and they said that right now

245
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:07,039
they were doing, I think one plane every three minutes

246
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,000
and you think that's an amazing difference

247
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:11,409
in terms of takeoff.

248
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:12,229
It,

249
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,250
it was, it was crazy and in fact,

250
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,270
it screwed up air travel for like three days and I was just

251
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,000
glad that I got out and I got to where I was going

252
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:23,479
and then I was there for the week and even by the time I was done

253
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,500
it was still like,

254
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:28,099
the airports were still rough where there were lots of people hanging out and,

255
00:10:28,109 --> 00:10:29,380
and it was just, it was madness.

256
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,340
It was such a pain in the neck. But yeah, I mean, I totally get it and,

257
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,869
and, and these people, they can't update their systems in, at a moment's notice.

258
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,900
I mean, they probably need to plan for months. I don't know how they're going to do it.

259
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,469
So what gets me though about like modern airports is even like my local airport,

260
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:45,710
you know, Edmonton International,

261
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:49,789
which is not by any means like a super large airport or even super busy.

262
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:50,840
Um,

263
00:10:51,219 --> 00:10:53,840
when I was a kid, you know, we'd fly through it and it was like

264
00:10:53,969 --> 00:10:54,760
dead at night.

265
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:55,539
Like there were, you know,

266
00:10:55,549 --> 00:10:57,960
there were basically there were flights from like eight or nine in the morning until

267
00:10:57,969 --> 00:11:00,679
like five or six in the afternoon or maybe a little bit in the evening,

268
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:03,669
you know, but even in Edmonton International.

269
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:07,419
Now that sort of, that dead time is like, maybe four or six hours,

270
00:11:07,729 --> 00:11:12,289
you know, and, and major airports, like, say, Heathrow or, you know, uh, well, yeah,

271
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:13,200
like those, uh,

272
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,869
like Atlanta or, uh, what is it?

273
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,299
Saint Paul Minneapolis, you know, those, like, hub airport or Denver.

274
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:21,770
Denver is a great example, you know, those things never have downtime now,

275
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,340
basically.

276
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,289
Or if they do it's like an hour maybe.

277
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,559
And that's what gets me is,

278
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:30,340
you know, it's, it's like these just in time delivery networks, you know, is, yeah,

279
00:11:30,349 --> 00:11:32,250
they're hyper efficient and it's, you know,

280
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,250
it's great that Chicago is using their runways to maximum capacity, you know,

281
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,530
a plane coming off and on every 30 seconds.

282
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:39,809
That's great, you know, economically speaking.

283
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,520
But yeah, if anything breaks, you are so up the creek, you know,

284
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,760
and a great example of this is like Atlanta right now,

285
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,159
you know.

286
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,729
Um, they've now had, uh so, uh

287
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:55,380
they had a fire under the, uh what was it? The I

288
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,969
-- I blank I 20 or I 85 I
-- think it's 85.

289
00:11:59,130 --> 00:11:59,369
So

290
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:05,010
they had like a lay down yard below the I 85 where they kept like a whole bunch of cable

291
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,450
spools with PV C Conduit or something that caught on

292
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,450
fire and it got hot enough that the concrete,

293
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:10,929
you know,

294
00:12:11,369 --> 00:12:14,739
uh stressed and cracked and a whole section of the I 85 fell down

295
00:12:15,549 --> 00:12:16,729
and there's actually a really nice, uh,

296
00:12:16,739 --> 00:12:19,359
live cam on it now that you can watch them rebuilding it.

297
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,270
Um, very high quality camera. Very enu anyway,

298
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:22,400
uh,

299
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,489
then they had

300
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:27,130
a railroad fire under a bridge and they're

301
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,760
inspecting the bridge to make sure it's ok.

302
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:29,099
And,

303
00:12:29,219 --> 00:12:32,450
well, I hope it's ok because if not, like, that's another bridge to rebuild.

304
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,780
Uh, then, and this one's shorter.

305
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:38,010
So they just had a chemical spill on like one of the on ramps or off ramps or something.

306
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,510
So it was shut down for like a day or two.

307
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:42,030
But then what was it yesterday?

308
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,849
There's like all they would confirm is that like

309
00:12:44,859 --> 00:12:46,849
a contractor was working on a gas line,

310
00:12:46,859 --> 00:12:49,280
like retiring some casing or whatever that means.

311
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:51,080
So I assume they were just replacing the pipe

312
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:54,549
and something went wrong and there's like a 2 m

313
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:57,500
bulge in the road closing two lanes of it,

314
00:12:58,469 --> 00:13:02,320
you know, and this, and this pavement is like a foot thick and it's like just

315
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:04,090
like tossed up, you know,

316
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:05,489
and

317
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:05,690
a

318
00:13:06,409 --> 00:13:10,469
I Yeah, what got me was when they were asking the guy, like, you know,

319
00:13:10,479 --> 00:13:13,900
how bad should we expect traffic to be on Monday or on

320
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:18,390
Monday or whatever? And he's like, you can expect it to be super, super, super bad.

321
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,690
-- Like the guy used the word super three times.
-- That's

322
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:21,760
awesome,

323
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:23,989
you know, and

324
00:13:24,229 --> 00:13:28,469
like, that's the thing, right? Like we can't afford to build an extra set of ropes

325
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,150
just in case,

326
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:31,669
you know, some of them break.

327
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,549
That's,

328
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,219
that's a good,

329
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:34,859
well,

330
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,200
that's true because any time you build an extra

331
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:41,669
highway through an area it's to alleviate congestion,

332
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:43,849
it's not like a redundant backup.

333
00:13:43,859 --> 00:13:44,679
Exactly.

334
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,590
You know,

335
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:50,309
I mean, we just kind of have to live with this whole, you know, well, if it breaks,

336
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,010
it breaks and, I mean, in the extreme case of like that

337
00:13:53,219 --> 00:13:56,969
piece that collapsed, it's going to take a few at a minimum, a few weeks,

338
00:13:56,979 --> 00:13:58,429
if not months to replace it.

339
00:13:58,979 --> 00:13:59,460
Um,

340
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,270
I don't know if you remember in California after the big earthquake, uh,

341
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,330
many years ago

342
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:06,070
they basically went to 24 7 construction

343
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:08,909
and they had, uh, what I thought was really clever.

344
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:13,070
They had, the Department of Transport had inspectors on site 24 hours a day

345
00:14:13,349 --> 00:14:15,640
so that there were no delays waiting for inspections.

346
00:14:16,469 --> 00:14:17,000
Right. They just,

347
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,789
they basically what they did is they looked at every single latency loop

348
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:23,479
and closed, every single one they could,

349
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,719
that makes a lot of sense to me,

350
00:14:26,219 --> 00:14:26,630
you know,

351
00:14:26,789 --> 00:14:28,599
and the thing is, but here's the problem,

352
00:14:28,609 --> 00:14:31,739
the upfront cost is much higher than building it slowly.

353
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:32,919
But of course,

354
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:36,239
you know, by building it quickly and getting the economy back up and running,

355
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,400
sort of, you know, like,

356
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,719
I can't even imagine how much time truckers are wasting in Atlanta right now.

357
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:46,760
You know, it, it, it makes the quality of life terrible and I'm sure it does increase

358
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:51,460
-- the cost on the city, but I bet the benefits are substantial.
-- Oh, of course.

359
00:14:51,469 --> 00:14:53,570
But the problem is these are all externalized costs, you know,

360
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,039
they don't show up on the, on the

361
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,820
balance sheet directly of the city. You know?

362
00:14:58,299 --> 00:14:58,309
I

363
00:14:58,669 --> 00:14:59,909
mean, and that's always the problem with these.

364
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:03,219
It's like the pollution problem or, well, again the upgrade problem. Right.

365
00:15:03,229 --> 00:15:07,739
The upgrade cost is upfront and immediate, like, oh, I upgraded it and it broke.

366
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:09,820
Now I have to spend the weekend fixing it

367
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,659
versus I don't upgrade it and I take a nonzero chance that, you know,

368
00:15:14,669 --> 00:15:15,609
maybe we get hacked,

369
00:15:15,909 --> 00:15:18,789
maybe we don't get hacked fingers crossed. Right.

370
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:19,690
Right.

371
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,250
And this is in,

372
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,010
this is a discussion that I think is always

373
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:28,010
very interesting and this is one that I have spent

374
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,119
a fair bit of time

375
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,619
investigating and, and trying to understand is

376
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,469
what is our return on investment for security

377
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:38,260
and in a lot of instances

378
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,169
it's bad

379
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:42,450
and, well, ok, generally we don't know. All right. Number one,

380
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,690
but when we, the things we do understand

381
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:45,200
a

382
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,010
lot of security investment is wasted money

383
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,469
because sometimes it is easier to clean up the mess

384
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,059
on the other side.

385
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,299
That's something that always, you know,

386
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,809
realistically, that's something that people forget is when it comes to risk,

387
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,500
you basically have three major strategies,

388
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,380
you can just avoid the risk entirely. Like we're just not going to do that.

389
00:16:04,619 --> 00:16:05,059
You know,

390
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:06,109
um,

391
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,809
secondly, you can choose to try and mitigate the risk.

392
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,210
You know, we'll,

393
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,380
we'll put on like antivirus software and we'll install a firewall and we'll hire,

394
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,500
you know, hire a guy with a dog to guard the server room.

395
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:18,700
And then the third thing you can do is you can like,

396
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,289
uh, essentially accept the risk

397
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,900
and, and optionally do something to offset it, like buy insurance

398
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,330
and say, you know, perfect example, my house is not fireproof.

399
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:32,299
Uh I could in theory build a fireproof house.

400
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:36,080
It would be very expensive if it was cheaper just to get a normal house and buy,

401
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,419
you know, standard insurance.

402
00:16:38,489 --> 00:16:39,070
Well, and,

403
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,169
and part of it as well is the odds

404
00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:44,190
of your house burning down are realistically very low

405
00:16:45,049 --> 00:16:47,880
-- and
-- it's low enough that it makes the paper when it happens locally.

406
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:48,510
Right.

407
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,599
-- Right.
-- That's always my rule of thumb. Right.

408
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:53,909
If it's, if it's, if it's rare enough to actually end up in the papers,

409
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:55,130
I don't have to worry about it.

410
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,640
It's the stuff that you don't hear about in the papers that, you know,

411
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,250
that's the stuff that's actually killing people on a regular basis.

412
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,070
Right?

413
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,969
But so you actually have a really good point

414
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:08,368
when you talk about the house analogy in this context is

415
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,650
sometimes

416
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:13,729
we plan for things that are ridiculous

417
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,650
and

418
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,880
fire insurance is basically the extent of your

419
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,270
planning for your house burning down or,

420
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,000
or backing up your

421
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,959
it's another one. Yeah. Well, smoke alarms aren't really,

422
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,000
those are about making sure you don't die.

423
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:25,560
Right.

424
00:17:25,739 --> 00:17:28,270
It's risk alleviation because I'm accepting that it will burn down.

425
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,359
So, what can I do to, you know,

426
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:30,890
that even less terrible,

427
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,400
it probably won't even,

428
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:33,469
it's just,

429
00:17:33,609 --> 00:17:36,729
you don't want to not have them because the,

430
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:40,550
the potential payoff from having them is incredibly high and let's face it.

431
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,229
The upfront investment cost is very, very low.

432
00:17:44,069 --> 00:17:46,739
And, and this is kind of where we fail in security a lot is

433
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,430
we don't understand you, you kind of have to have

434
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,479
a couple of ways to look at it. You can do nothing

435
00:17:51,619 --> 00:17:54,300
and then you're basically backloading all the cost where there

436
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,000
will be an event and then you pay for it,

437
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:56,410
right?

438
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:57,300
But that's

439
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,589
the thing, there may not be an event,

440
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:00,729
-- that's just
-- it right? There might not be,

441
00:18:01,089 --> 00:18:02,160
there might not be,

442
00:18:02,219 --> 00:18:06,150
but you should assume there will be when you're doing this kind of planning, right?

443
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,969
There's you front load all your cost where you build your fireproof house,

444
00:18:09,979 --> 00:18:12,030
which is generally insanely expensive.

445
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:14,910
But that's also what we try to do in security more often than not is

446
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,140
we try to front load all the costs to prevent the bad thing from happening

447
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:18,939
and is, well,

448
00:18:18,949 --> 00:18:22,400
you can still build a fireproof house and your house can still burn down, right?

449
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,329
There's gonna be,

450
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:27,900
there's gonna be things that can burn in the house and if they light on fire,

451
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,729
yes, the structure may be standing,

452
00:18:29,739 --> 00:18:31,550
but all the stuff inside is either gone or it

453
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,180
smells like smoke and you're gonna throw it away.

454
00:18:33,189 --> 00:18:33,800
Ok.

455
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:38,300
And then there's basically trying to figure out what can I do up front

456
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,619
that will significantly alleviate

457
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:43,910
the cost after the event.

458
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,510
And like smoke alarms are a great example of that is human life is we'll say, I,

459
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,739
I know it has a value from the insurance companies but, but we'll say it's

460
00:18:52,349 --> 00:18:52,839
yes,

461
00:18:52,949 --> 00:18:54,790
we'll say it's extremely valuable.

462
00:18:55,180 --> 00:19:00,069
And so in our case, like literally spending a couple 100 bucks on smoke detectors can

463
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:03,150
save that incredibly valuable asset

464
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,420
when there is an event.

465
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,150
You know, if we think about this in the context of security,

466
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,150
what do we do that has minimal upfront cost,

467
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,949
but substantial savings later on.

468
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,459
And, and I bet if I, if I asked 10 people this question,

469
00:19:15,829 --> 00:19:20,339
I would be lucky if I got 10 answers even. Right. And none of them would be the same.

470
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,410
Yeah.

471
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,060
Oh, totally. And I mean, and it even varies.

472
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:25,260
I mean, there's, you know,

473
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:28,380
my classic one that I love the most because it's so useless now

474
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:32,369
-- is don't click links from untrusted sources.
-- That's so.

475
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:33,670
No,

476
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,060
-- no, no, no. In the
-- modern world. Ok.

477
00:19:36,069 --> 00:19:37,609
Oh, you're saying the advice is terrible. Yes.

478
00:19:38,189 --> 00:19:39,180
That doesn't make any sense.

479
00:19:39,939 --> 00:19:40,459
Advice.

480
00:19:40,689 --> 00:19:43,459
-- Yeah,
-- because for one thing, well, how am I supposed to browse the web,

481
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:44,979
not only

482
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:45,449
number

483
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:50,910
-- two, I mean,
-- a sophisticated attacker is going to send me spam from Kurt

484
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:51,449
siefried

485
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:52,660
and right,

486
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:56,489
like that is what you do. That is how it works.

487
00:19:56,589 --> 00:19:58,939
You know what I remember is, remember the I love you virus

488
00:19:59,069 --> 00:19:59,729
the

489
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:02,359
20 years

490
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:02,510
in

491
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:02,780
the

492
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:03,660
back.

493
00:20:03,979 --> 00:20:04,319
Well,

494
00:20:04,449 --> 00:20:07,540
I, I remember when it hit because, you know, I, every single,

495
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:10,540
like very technical person was like, oh God, no, don't open that.

496
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,060
Don't open that.

497
00:20:11,069 --> 00:20:13,790
And of course my favorite was reading this article where this journalist is like,

498
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:13,949
well,

499
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:17,589
at first I was suspicious of it but then like 10 more of my acquaintances sent it to me.

500
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:20,040
So I thought it must be legit and I opened it

501
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:21,400
like God damn.

502
00:20:22,349 --> 00:20:24,000
But what I love was my mom.

503
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:28,660
She came home from work and I'm like, oh, please don't tell me you like click the,

504
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,319
I love you thing.

505
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:30,810
She's like, no, no, no, I didn't. I'm like, ha ha.

506
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,569
She's like everybody else did, but I didn't, I'm like,

507
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,589
I'm OK legitimately why she's like, well, the first one I got was from my boss.

508
00:20:37,829 --> 00:20:42,099
So clearly my boss clearly does not love me. Like, so, you know.

509
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:43,209
Right.

510
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:44,160
Right. Obviously.

511
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:47,050
And then when you see like a whole bunch more of them, it's like, OK, clearly,

512
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,260
this isn't quite right.

513
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,219
That's awesome.

514
00:20:49,229 --> 00:20:50,619
You know, and, and she was like,

515
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:53,689
literally the only one in the office that didn't click this thing and you know,

516
00:20:53,699 --> 00:20:55,449
of course they spent, well,

517
00:20:55,459 --> 00:20:58,329
the whole world spent weeks cleaning this piece of garbage off the servers.

518
00:20:58,339 --> 00:20:58,479
And

519
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,979
I mean, what really frustrated me is even after that, you know, there were,

520
00:21:01,989 --> 00:21:04,119
it would still kind of pop up once in a while.

521
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,650
Right. Like, somebody would, you know,

522
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,189
open an old one and, like,

523
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,900
it would bounce around the university or something for a while.

524
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:09,089
But,

525
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,079
yeah, so, I mean, this whole idea of like all this old advice that,

526
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,079
you know, people swear by is like,

527
00:21:15,329 --> 00:21:18,040
-- it doesn't make any sense anymore.
-- It doesn't. And

528
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:21,180
I have come to the realization

529
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:24,270
and, and I'm certainly not the only person to do this, but

530
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:28,430
it, it's obvious that in the way the world has changed with like all this cloud,

531
00:21:28,439 --> 00:21:28,930
all the DEV

532
00:21:29,109 --> 00:21:31,739
ops we've got just the way that everything's distributed.

533
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,209
People are doing work on their telephones, they're using their own tablets,

534
00:21:35,219 --> 00:21:36,219
stuff like that, that

535
00:21:36,699 --> 00:21:40,469
the vast majority of security advice and practices we use today are,

536
00:21:40,479 --> 00:21:42,189
are so comically outdated

537
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:43,369
and, and we,

538
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,729
we basically have nothing to replace them and we don't

539
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:47,540
even know where to start in a lot of cases,

540
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,469
which is nuts.

541
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,410
Yeah, I mean, honestly, for me,

542
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:54,930
one of the biggest things I have encouraged for most people

543
00:21:55,589 --> 00:21:56,410
use

544
00:21:56,579 --> 00:21:58,170
an up to date web browser

545
00:21:58,569 --> 00:21:59,790
as your app, right?

546
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,959
Like, don't, don't use an email app, use a web browser like gmail, you know,

547
00:22:04,069 --> 00:22:05,280
and then right there boom.

548
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,060
That makes life a whole lot more difficult, you know,

549
00:22:07,069 --> 00:22:08,979
because remember we used to laugh about, oh, you know,

550
00:22:08,989 --> 00:22:12,010
it's safe to open up an image because you could never get hacked through an image.

551
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:15,569
And of course, that changed like 1015 years ago, you know,

552
00:22:15,579 --> 00:22:17,180
with all these buffer overflows.

553
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,829
But, um, I mean, that's, that's honestly, that is about the only,

554
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:21,869
well,

555
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,660
and the second piece of real world advice I typically offer to people

556
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,949
who are less computer savvy is get a phone or a tablet.

557
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:27,750
Don't get a computer.

558
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,989
I agree completely.

559
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:29,310
In

560
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:29,949
fact that

561
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:33,630
the neighbor who I helped out, I think it was two episodes ago I talked about,

562
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:34,780
I brought,

563
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:37,359
I brought all this, I got it working right as you'd expect

564
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:39,890
days because there were like millions of updates anyway.

565
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:43,030
I brought it back to him and I'm like, all right, here we go. I've got all this working.

566
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:43,150
You know,

567
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,079
I set it up for me his house and I show it to him and then I just looked at him and said,

568
00:22:46,089 --> 00:22:47,290
go buy an ipad

569
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,010
all,

570
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,000
stop using this computer. You don't need it,

571
00:22:51,219 --> 00:22:54,319
just buy a tablet because you will thank me someday.

572
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,199
Yeah. No, I had the same experience this weekend.

573
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:03,500
I replaced a friend, her parents, you know, they had a wraw RT 54 G

574
00:23:03,869 --> 00:23:07,579
-- router. Like one of those
-- old, oh man, those, those ones could run Linux.

575
00:23:07,729 --> 00:23:12,260
I remember, I bought the, the L model just because it was, it was designed for Linux

576
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:15,540
and they were awesome little wireless routers like

577
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:16,329
10 years ago.

578
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,989
But nowadays they're terrible and their range

579
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,329
is terrible and they're just terrible.

580
00:23:20,709 --> 00:23:23,329
Um And it's, you know, 2.4 gigahertz.

581
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:25,760
So the whole neighborhood is just stomping over each other.

582
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:26,479
So anyways II,

583
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:29,300
I gave them like a more up to date router that does five gigahertz and stuff.

584
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:29,439
And

585
00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:33,329
their desktop computer plugged into the router directly with a cable

586
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:37,349
was getting slower speeds than like my phone.

587
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:41,829
Like their desktop is just, and this is after my friend, you know,

588
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:44,459
she put it through malware bytes and a whole bunch of other stuff

589
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,829
and it's just, this machine is so

590
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,680
I don't, it's just whatever's wrong with it. There's so much wrong with it

591
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:52,989
that it literally,

592
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:57,099
you know, it, it's network speed is slower than my phone going over the wireless.

593
00:23:57,109 --> 00:23:59,449
Is it just really old or is it full of garbage? No,

594
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:01,729
no, it's like a, it's like a, it's like a,

595
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:05,709
a stand up, you know, integrated windows PC running Windows seven

596
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,790
which tried to upgrade itself to Windows 10 and failed.

597
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:12,579
Um And I looked at that and I just, I basically had to like, say to myself like, hurt.

598
00:24:12,589 --> 00:24:14,300
No, it's ok. You know,

599
00:24:14,709 --> 00:24:16,979
these are nice people but you don't have to like, you know,

600
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:19,359
go back into the burning building to save the washer and dryer.

601
00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:21,660
It's just walk away, just walk away,

602
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,339
you know. And luckily, yeah, the, uh, the one,

603
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:30,920
person does have an ipad so they have at least one reasonably working computer. But,

604
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,500
yeah, you know, it's just like, uh, just,

605
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,969
I literally had to force myself to walk away from it because, yeah,

606
00:24:35,979 --> 00:24:39,170
trying to save that computer would take a dozen hours.

607
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:42,540
I know the feeling. Well, this is why I had my, uh,

608
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,369
my, my parents' neighbor bring me his computer because then

609
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,199
I would do things and then walk away for the

610
00:24:48,209 --> 00:24:50,979
six hours it took to install windows update and then

611
00:24:51,459 --> 00:24:52,030
later,

612
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:56,060
well, and this is the thing, right? Like you think this is, you know, this is bad.

613
00:24:56,069 --> 00:25:00,060
Yeah. Try it when you have like a, a corporate network with a 10,000 servers

614
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,250
and three of them are running an accounting app for which we don't have

615
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:06,660
any support because the person who built this died or went out of business.

616
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:10,739
-- So, if it dies we're screwed. But,
-- ok, so, so let's latch on to that thought.

617
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,819
And what we end up with though is

618
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,540
in a case like that, they don't even get to pick which option

619
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:17,699
they want for risk.

620
00:25:17,869 --> 00:25:20,380
Like they have to pick, do nothing

621
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,099
and, and like, prayer,

622
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,660
prayer is their risk management solution.

623
00:25:24,849 --> 00:25:27,040
Yeah, pretty much. I mean, what do you?

624
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:30,839
I'm glad I'm not in that situation right now. All right, let's just say that.

625
00:25:31,199 --> 00:25:31,329
Yeah.

626
00:25:31,339 --> 00:25:31,550
Well,

627
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,020
and this is one of the reasons I think cloud

628
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,060
is so compelling to a lot of these business people.

629
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:35,569
It's like,

630
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,670
well from the outside,

631
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,010
it looks like these cloud providers keep everything up to date and running fine and,

632
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,250
and some do and

633
00:25:42,449 --> 00:25:43,400
-- some don't,
-- whatever, man.

634
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:46,869
You know, it's like a disastrous mess of, like,

635
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,209
on fire sheep running around burning.

636
00:25:49,939 --> 00:25:52,569
What was it, that thing, Amazon was talking about how they don't use,

637
00:25:52,579 --> 00:25:55,609
actually amazon.com, like the, the,

638
00:25:55,619 --> 00:26:00,609
the commerce website stuff apparently doesn't use Aws for their hosting because

639
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,410
it's just not capable enough or something.

640
00:26:03,969 --> 00:26:05,560
There's some articles on this a few weeks ago.

641
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:06,869
I did not read them,

642
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,000
but I actually know this story and I will not

643
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:11,109
tell it because the person who told it to me,

644
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,439
I suspect doesn't want it to get out.

645
00:26:12,449 --> 00:26:13,510
But yes, that is true.

646
00:26:13,699 --> 00:26:15,589
And there are many reasons I'll say.

647
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:16,469
Yeah.

648
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,500
Well, no, I mean, I mean, Amazon, what is it,

649
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:22,250
over 50% of all online dollars spent on the internet now?

650
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:26,849
-- Are with Amazon in North America?
-- I would not doubt that because it's so easy to use.

651
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:27,150
I mean,

652
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,469
whenever I need something that's basically just where I go because it's also,

653
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:31,640
I click twice and it,

654
00:26:32,035 --> 00:26:33,655
at my door often the next day,

655
00:26:34,334 --> 00:26:36,104
you know, that's, that's what I'm really noticing. Right.

656
00:26:36,114 --> 00:26:38,114
Is all these off like these, uh, what is it?

657
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:42,614
The Amazon delivery courier bit work piece work now thing that, you know,

658
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:45,074
where they're delivering packages on the weekend and stuff and it's,

659
00:26:45,244 --> 00:26:47,935
I love it, but again, it scares me where this economy is headed and,

660
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:49,875
you know, it goes back to that redundancy piece.

661
00:26:49,885 --> 00:26:53,864
You know, Amazon's trying to kind of buy extra capacity and redundancy by, you know,

662
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:58,055
farming it out to like, essentially sharecroppers who deliver packages.

663
00:26:58,729 --> 00:27:01,869
You know, because, like, Amazon can't afford to build another

664
00:27:02,089 --> 00:27:05,540
separate logistics network. I mean, they are in the process of doing that already.

665
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,310
They're doing that.

666
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,260
Yeah, they're doing that, but I mean, they can't build it large enough, you know.

667
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:12,550
So they're, they're outsourcing like that last mile as much as possible.

668
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:17,339
There's nothing wrong with outsourcing and in many instances,

669
00:27:17,349 --> 00:27:18,900
I suspect that that could be part of our,

670
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:20,385
with security is

671
00:27:20,576 --> 00:27:24,235
we try to do too much in house and you just can't have

672
00:27:24,406 --> 00:27:26,196
that much talent in one place.

673
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:29,316
And again, that goes back to the whole clown thing of why, you know,

674
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:33,806
a clown provider can easily get a team of five or 10 security people and, you know,

675
00:27:33,816 --> 00:27:35,086
and really do a good job on their

676
00:27:35,345 --> 00:27:36,776
-- end.
-- Not just that man. I mean, so,

677
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:39,176
you know, we are security people. I don't have to say,

678
00:27:39,302 --> 00:27:40,572
imagine you're a security person but

679
00:27:40,781 --> 00:27:45,362
like, where would you rather work on Aws doing security or would you rather be at,

680
00:27:45,371 --> 00:27:47,921
you know, like Joe's accounting service in Hamburger shop,

681
00:27:48,161 --> 00:27:48,771
you know?

682
00:27:49,171 --> 00:27:51,442
Yeah, I want to go over with Aws,

683
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:54,751
you know, I, I know some of the local banks here and they, all the,

684
00:27:54,761 --> 00:27:56,352
when I say small local banks, I mean,

685
00:27:56,472 --> 00:27:59,482
you know, they have less than say, 1000 branches in Canada,

686
00:27:59,942 --> 00:28:02,602
you know, and they generally have one or two captive hackers in house.

687
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:04,260
I believe that.

688
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,099
And that's it, you know, versus like a major cloud provider.

689
00:28:08,439 --> 00:28:09,609
And, uh,

690
00:28:10,479 --> 00:28:11,709
yeah, I mean, I just,

691
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:15,300
there are not enough security professionals to go around.

692
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:18,089
That's part of it too. And it really does frustrate me that we,

693
00:28:18,209 --> 00:28:19,609
you know, think about this.

694
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:23,260
I remember setting up a DH TP server by hand, way back in the day, you know,

695
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,939
like actually editing the DH p.com file

696
00:28:26,189 --> 00:28:27,410
trying to figure out the,

697
00:28:27,699 --> 00:28:28,550
the various

698
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,719
uh uh

699
00:28:29,939 --> 00:28:30,699
not zones.

700
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,880
What's the scopes, the various scopes, you know,

701
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:34,459
and attaching them to the right interface and, oh,

702
00:28:34,589 --> 00:28:36,140
just all the black magic

703
00:28:36,329 --> 00:28:38,199
and now you just like turn on the router

704
00:28:38,829 --> 00:28:40,810
and the defaults are like it's on, it works,

705
00:28:41,369 --> 00:28:41,530
right.

706
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,910
You know what I mean? Same thing with secure Webster, right?

707
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,290
I remember setting one of those up and having to

708
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,930
buy a certificate and all that and now it's just

709
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,239
you turn it on it works

710
00:28:48,469 --> 00:28:51,369
and security hasn't really done that.

711
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,170
No, no, we've not

712
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,609
-- like
-- what good security have we, you know,

713
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:58,680
really the only example I can think of good security by

714
00:28:58,689 --> 00:29:01,890
default that just works is like the fingerprint reader on iphones.

715
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:05,719
That one, that one's pretty good and well, ok. So here's the deal though is,

716
00:29:06,489 --> 00:29:09,949
yes, the fingerprint readers on, we'll say phones in general

717
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:11,199
are,

718
00:29:11,589 --> 00:29:15,180
I would say improving security substantially for most people because now a lot of

719
00:29:15,189 --> 00:29:18,650
people I know who just didn't have phone locks because they couldn't be bothered.

720
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,630
I know. I know. Well, that's the thing. We're not supposed to understand it. Right.

721
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,709
We're not those people,

722
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:25,829
we, we will never understand

723
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:29,430
how they think or, or why they do the things they do. And that's ok.

724
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:30,359
But,

725
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:33,520
but the point is fingerprint readers have these people,

726
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:35,650
you know, using security now, why?

727
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:39,930
Because it's easy, it's super easy and they can understand the benefit of that.

728
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,209
Whereas you go to a person and you say, oh,

729
00:29:42,219 --> 00:29:44,239
you just have to do this and this and this and this and this and

730
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,780
you give them this insane laundry list of things they should do to be.

731
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,569
We'll use the word secure in air quotes

732
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,900
and they say this is dumb. I don't care.

733
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,939
And they're not wrong though. They're not wrong.

734
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,189
Well, a great example,

735
00:29:55,199 --> 00:29:58,479
actually coming back to the show notes is the fishing via Scary unicode.

736
00:29:58,489 --> 00:30:01,520
You know, we've known for a long time. So there's unicode characters that look.

737
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:02,380
Well,

738
00:30:02,849 --> 00:30:04,189
this one's actually special.

739
00:30:04,199 --> 00:30:06,930
If you haven't read this story, I'll, I'll put it in the show notes.

740
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:08,469
And what's essentially happened is

741
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,920
if you have a certain

742
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,439
glyph character sense, you know, things like Chinese and Japanese and whatnot

743
00:30:15,719 --> 00:30:16,650
there is,

744
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:21,000
you can't type those on an English speaking keyboard obviously.

745
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:25,670
And so they, they've set it up in a way so it uses certain, you know,

746
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,380
western character sets

747
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,000
to display

748
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:29,910
the,

749
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,829
I don't even know if I'd say it. Words is the correct term.

750
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:35,109
I, I'm not super familiar with the terminology in this, but

751
00:30:35,489 --> 00:30:37,239
basically, so like you can,

752
00:30:37,949 --> 00:30:40,880
if somebody registered what looks like apple.com,

753
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:44,729
but it's, it's not apple.com, it's a couple of

754
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,930
characters.

755
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:46,550
It's like

756
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:46,660
a

757
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:47,020
Cyrillic.

758
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:47,500
A

759
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,199
no, no, no, no, no, no, not in this instance.

760
00:30:50,209 --> 00:30:53,910
These are, these are asking characters but they're transformed in a certain way.

761
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,560
Just uh

762
00:30:54,739 --> 00:30:56,050
read the news story. It's

763
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,760
I, I don't understand the terminology around that

764
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:00,800
these were back to the, just like the standard. So

765
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,729
those are actually mostly solved because now if you do that,

766
00:31:06,189 --> 00:31:08,310
the web browsers in the address bar

767
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:10,890
color those characters differently in most cases.

768
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,859
So you can understand they are not the same.

769
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:16,010
And this is just another attack which actually what,

770
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,329
what this really comes down to though is the fact that

771
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,280
it, it, it's a game of can't mouse.

772
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:23,579
We can't win the browse and, and the browsers are all gonna fix this, right?

773
00:31:23,589 --> 00:31:25,859
They're gonna fix this. It won't be a problem. And then

774
00:31:26,199 --> 00:31:29,069
in, in a couple of weeks or months or years,

775
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:32,410
someone's gonna find a new way to misrepresent this stuff.

776
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,520
And

777
00:31:33,699 --> 00:31:37,729
that's ok though. Right. I'm not saying we're going to fix it. The trick is fix it fast

778
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,630
because if the scammers only have, you know,

779
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,719
say a two or three week window to work with,

780
00:31:42,989 --> 00:31:44,380
it's not going to be very effective.

781
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:44,969
Yeah.

782
00:31:44,979 --> 00:31:47,959
No, I mean, this cat and mouse game, that's, that's actually a good point is this,

783
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:52,199
you know, there will always be new attacks, full stop end of story, right?

784
00:31:52,699 --> 00:31:55,719
And the trick is like, you know, how fast can we

785
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,030
deal with them?

786
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,050
How fast can we say squish them down to like

787
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,969
only being a 1% problem instead of 100 you know,

788
00:32:00,979 --> 00:32:02,469
it reminds me of email spam,

789
00:32:02,949 --> 00:32:04,270
right? I remember when,

790
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:07,270
like, I remember when I used to have email with no spam filtering

791
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:08,699
right back in

792
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,380
like the late nineties

793
00:32:10,739 --> 00:32:14,339
and, you know, and then we started this cat and mouse game of like, oh keywords, well,

794
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,609
then they would misspell the keywords or whatever and then, you know, bay

795
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,069
and filtering, which is this, you know, magic of like,

796
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:21,469
here's a pile of good stuff, here's a pile of bad stuff,

797
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:23,089
figure out what the differences are and, you know,

798
00:32:23,099 --> 00:32:25,140
classify new stuff and that worked pretty good.

799
00:32:25,369 --> 00:32:27,359
Then they started sending those spams with like,

800
00:32:27,369 --> 00:32:30,959
like randomly written poetry and stuff, you know, kind of whatever,

801
00:32:31,229 --> 00:32:35,060
you know, and, and now I still, what kills me is I still get spam

802
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:37,989
that you really think would be caught because it's almost always these

803
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,369
like buying database lists of users that have been like verified and

804
00:32:41,579 --> 00:32:43,170
they really want to talk to you about

805
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:46,459
various technical subjects. So just buy this list and email them.

806
00:32:47,329 --> 00:32:48,579
I don't understand how that

807
00:32:48,729 --> 00:32:50,410
doesn't get caught by the spam folders.

808
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:53,579
But, you know, the point is basically, I only get like one or two of these a day tops.

809
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:53,949
I,

810
00:32:53,959 --> 00:32:56,949
I get almost no spam anymore and I don't even

811
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:58,910
look at my spam folder because my assumption is if,

812
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,390
if you sent me something and it goes in there,

813
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,630
it probably deserves to be in there anyway.

814
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:09,069
Yeah, I've actually um I've actually had a few false positives, um annoyingly. Um

815
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:13,209
but I mean, fundamentally spam is not a solved problem,

816
00:33:13,219 --> 00:33:16,670
but we've reduced it enough that it's not a problem problem.

817
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,000
It's an annoyance at best or at worst. You know,

818
00:33:20,189 --> 00:33:22,640
the real challenge becomes if you want to run your own mail servers.

819
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:24,229
I mean, then you have to jump through all these hoops

820
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:28,130
to do all the anti spam stuff to be for anybody to listen to you. Right?

821
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:32,199
Like a great example is I was actually um setting up and testing a new mail server

822
00:33:32,859 --> 00:33:36,439
and so I tried telling to port 25 from my workstation.

823
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:41,199
Uh and it actually my ISP no longer blocks port 25 outgoing, which is nice for them

824
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,109
to block that.

825
00:33:42,459 --> 00:33:43,040
But

826
00:33:43,369 --> 00:33:44,239
Uh I'm

827
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:48,000
the IP blocks are registered in the policy blacklist from,

828
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:50,010
I think it's spam house basically saying like these are

829
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,780
machines that should just never be sending mail directly.

830
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:56,160
And, and, and honestly, yeah, they're not wrong.

831
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:59,800
And so the beauty is the remote mail server basically went, you know,

832
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,079
er, something, something you're listed in the policy blacklist, blah, blah, blah,

833
00:34:03,089 --> 00:34:04,260
goodbye, click.

834
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:05,739
And I was like, ok.

835
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:07,439
Yeah. No, that, that's,

836
00:34:08,158 --> 00:34:09,688
you know, and, and I'm kind of um

837
00:34:10,928 --> 00:34:12,029
thinking this, you know,

838
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:13,608
while we were talking about that wordpress

839
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:15,467
wordpress thing where these guys are building,

840
00:34:15,478 --> 00:34:15,608
you know,

841
00:34:15,618 --> 00:34:17,498
they have a plug in that helps secure your wordpress

842
00:34:17,509 --> 00:34:20,018
site and they were basically classifying bad IP S and,

843
00:34:20,029 --> 00:34:20,829
you know, blocking them

844
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:25,750
and I'm kind of wondering long term if this like IP reputation thing is,

845
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,239
is going to have to be a thing because, you know, especially with I PV six,

846
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:31,978
there's just gonna be, you know, these huge blocks of network addresses

847
00:34:32,678 --> 00:34:33,779
with God knows what,

848
00:34:34,178 --> 00:34:36,268
you know, how do we, how do we keep sort of,

849
00:34:36,279 --> 00:34:37,759
how do we stop the bad guys from

850
00:34:37,768 --> 00:34:40,099
constantly hammering on our servers and attacking them?

851
00:34:40,118 --> 00:34:40,289
I

852
00:34:40,518 --> 00:34:41,498
don't know. I mean,

853
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:45,748
I'm not opposed to blacklist but I see two potential issues is number one,

854
00:34:45,759 --> 00:34:48,599
eventually just every IP will be on the blacklist, right.

855
00:34:48,789 --> 00:34:49,539
Someday

856
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:50,618
there won't be any,

857
00:34:51,228 --> 00:34:54,118
they have them, you know, they have them bleed off, right? Like the word for

858
00:34:54,668 --> 00:34:54,819
the

859
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:54,958
word

860
00:34:55,248 --> 00:34:55,539
guys.

861
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,708
So they get booted off after a few hours or a few days or whatever.

862
00:34:59,188 --> 00:34:59,718
Um,

863
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,800
and, you know, and I can see things like, you know, um,

864
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:05,790
a great example of being ecommerce sites that, you know, give preference to,

865
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,340
you know, um, sessions that are logged in

866
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:11,590
or sessions that have bought stuff in the past. Right?

867
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,469
Because, like, chances are, if you've, you know,

868
00:35:13,479 --> 00:35:16,459
if you've been to the website and actually purchased stuff in the past,

869
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:19,939
-- then you're like, chances are you're a legitimate customer and
-- that's,

870
00:35:20,449 --> 00:35:21,330
that's totally fair.

871
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:24,209
But so here's the other problem I can think of with,

872
00:35:24,219 --> 00:35:26,870
with utilizing blacklist heavily is

873
00:35:26,989 --> 00:35:28,320
with something like I PV six,

874
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:30,909
we're going to reach a point where you could conceivably have

875
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:35,459
a significant number of things blacklisted that it could be

876
00:35:35,709 --> 00:35:38,010
a real load on your system in terms of

877
00:35:38,709 --> 00:35:39,300
memory.

878
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:42,530
Well, I mean, there you would just start blacklisting the networks

879
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,219
that could be

880
00:35:44,439 --> 00:35:45,459
-- realistically,
-- right?

881
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,580
But then you enter problems like, you know, the classic one being,

882
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:52,540
um whenever I'm on my cell phone on, you know, not on Wi Fi, but on the, you know,

883
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,840
the cell data thing,

884
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,820
you know, I'm coming through a gateway

885
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:02,060
and there's like a handful of gateway addresses for my cell provider,

886
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,239
you know, so I'll, I'll literally hit sites and like, oh, you're coming from a bad IP.

887
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,540
And I'm like, you know, well,

888
00:36:07,929 --> 00:36:09,449
every single cell phone,

889
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,070
right? So

890
00:36:10,489 --> 00:36:11,780
did something that, you know,

891
00:36:11,989 --> 00:36:13,050
and then that's the other problem.

892
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,199
Right is you can easily, you know,

893
00:36:14,209 --> 00:36:18,169
I could go on the cell network and get that those IP s blacklisted and, you know,

894
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,560
that would be a huge pain in the butt for everybody.

895
00:36:21,629 --> 00:36:22,100
I mean,

896
00:36:22,939 --> 00:36:23,610
probably,

897
00:36:25,489 --> 00:36:26,489
-- yeah,
-- exactly.

898
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:26,649
And,

899
00:36:26,659 --> 00:36:28,439
but what I see is though is that we're

900
00:36:28,449 --> 00:36:30,120
going to have more of these automated systems where,

901
00:36:30,129 --> 00:36:33,889
you know, um, oh, I saw that IP yesterday and it was behaving reasonably well.

902
00:36:33,899 --> 00:36:36,129
Let's, you know, give it the benefit of the doubt for today,

903
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:37,129
you know,

904
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:40,949
versus it's a new IP, I don't know what it's doing. Oh, it's behaving badly. Ok.

905
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:44,179
Let's try blocking it, you know, for half an hour and see what happens, you know,

906
00:36:44,189 --> 00:36:44,229
things

907
00:36:44,399 --> 00:36:44,850
like that.

908
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:47,969
That's fair. I, I won't disagree with that and

909
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,500
the trick obviously becomes just having the tools to do this sort of thing.

910
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:55,050
And I think we're getting really close with a lot of the A I and machine learning

911
00:36:55,189 --> 00:36:57,419
that that's developing and becoming a thing

912
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:01,719
because I know I, I've talked to a handful of A I and machine learning type folks, uh,

913
00:37:01,729 --> 00:37:03,209
a couple of months ago it was,

914
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,179
and

915
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:06,570
they were saying that the,

916
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,129
the things they were doing a year ago

917
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,780
are drastically different from the way it works

918
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:14,639
now because the industry is evolving so quickly.

919
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:15,909
It's just like

920
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:16,040
the

921
00:37:16,179 --> 00:37:16,300
web

922
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:20,600
when you, when you think about where the web went from, like 95 to 2000.

923
00:37:21,649 --> 00:37:22,530
Oh, man. You know,

924
00:37:22,729 --> 00:37:26,120
not, not even just that you got to think the iphone is 10 years old,

925
00:37:26,429 --> 00:37:29,030
11 years ago. We didn't have smartphones. Now.

926
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,110
Can you imagine living your life without a smartphone today? I can't,

927
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:38,389
that, that would like, yeah, I honestly, like when I lost my wallet I was like, oh,

928
00:37:38,399 --> 00:37:40,169
thank God, I lost my wallet and not my phone.

929
00:37:41,729 --> 00:37:42,989
Like, seriously,

930
00:37:43,659 --> 00:37:44,100
-- you
-- know,

931
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:49,959
I agree with you completely. I would rather give someone my wallet than my phone

932
00:37:50,129 --> 00:37:51,379
if I had to choose.

933
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:51,989
Yeah.

934
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:53,040
Yeah, totally.

935
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,790
Um, yeah. No, the, the world has definitely changed. I mean,

936
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:00,189
yeah. No, it's, it's a whole different world now.

937
00:38:01,139 --> 00:38:02,439
Oh, you gotta love it.

938
00:38:03,629 --> 00:38:04,250
So

939
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:07,000
welcome to the future we deserve.

940
00:38:07,889 --> 00:38:09,350
Yeah. Well, and it's

941
00:38:09,479 --> 00:38:11,060
the one thing that really gets me about this

942
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,949
whole machine learning A I stuff is I don't

943
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:16,489
and I kind of hope we never see like general purpose A I or whatever,

944
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,300
but we're gonna see some hopefully,

945
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:20,719
like really domain specific A I and machine

946
00:38:20,729 --> 00:38:23,050
learning that will make life a lot better.

947
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,850
Like the biggest thing I could see is, you know,

948
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,870
a combination of self driving cars being centrally directed

949
00:38:28,149 --> 00:38:30,030
could really make traffic better,

950
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:32,149
you know.

951
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:33,469
You know,

952
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:35,610
things like platooning traffic so that you never have to

953
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,489
stop for a stoplight is just kind of meshed,

954
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:37,870
you know.

955
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:39,040
Right. And

956
00:38:39,149 --> 00:38:40,860
-- things like that
-- would make a huge difference.

957
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:42,639
A possibility we'll say.

958
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,469
Yeah.

959
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:45,540
Anyway, anyway,

960
00:38:45,739 --> 00:38:47,449
or even cars that just know how to merge

961
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:50,429
cars that aren't driven by people, like literally

962
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,250
anything is better than people.

963
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:57,350
Yeah, we just had a snowfall uh, this weekend and of course,

964
00:38:57,479 --> 00:38:59,790
100 plus collisions because, you know,

965
00:38:59,899 --> 00:39:03,610
snow in April, that's totally unexpected and people forgot how to drive in

966
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,879
winter already.

967
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:05,189
Of

968
00:39:05,429 --> 00:39:05,639
course,

969
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,540
the roads have been nice for about a month

970
00:39:07,739 --> 00:39:09,250
and today we've had snow again.

971
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,709
So I'm guessing another whack ton of collisions as people

972
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:13,320
forget how to drive in the snow because again,

973
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:14,379
-- it's been like three days since
-- been

974
00:39:14,489 --> 00:39:14,969
snow.

975
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:15,370
You

976
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:15,530
know,

977
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:17,850
I love it.

978
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:19,419
Well, I'm sure part of it too though.

979
00:39:19,429 --> 00:39:22,639
I bet a lot of people have taken their snow tires off their cars and,

980
00:39:22,979 --> 00:39:25,979
-- and whatnot.
-- A lot of people here run all season because it's just, you know,

981
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:26,909
it's,

982
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:30,639
I run all season but man, snow tires, you can't beat snow tires.

983
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,120
True.

984
00:39:32,129 --> 00:39:37,030
I mean, but, uh, in general, I mean, we almost got sideswiped by a guy who just like,

985
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,959
came up way too fast and kind of forgot that it had snow

986
00:39:42,629 --> 00:39:44,050
-- godless
-- people.

987
00:39:44,419 --> 00:39:48,850
Yeah. So he did wave at us and he did look, you know, contrite and apologetic. But

988
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,540
anyway, anyway, let's, uh, we should talk about this,

989
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:56,300
this siren story from Dallas Texas

990
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,409
because,

991
00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:59,239
well, I can,

992
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:02,770
I can speak firsthand of that having those stupid n smoke alarms that have failed.

993
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:02,860
Now,

994
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:06,500
-- you have been
-- replaced now. Do you still have them or have you given up?

995
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:07,399
They,

996
00:40:07,969 --> 00:40:10,610
they sent me an updated version of them saying that, yeah,

997
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,580
we know this is a problem with the first version.

998
00:40:13,429 --> 00:40:14,850
That's just great.

999
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:15,629
Yeah.

1000
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:19,889
So they send me new ones, like a newer model and I put them back up because, well, yeah,

1001
00:40:19,899 --> 00:40:20,239
I mean,

1002
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:23,449
I also actually bought old timey smoke alarms and the funniest thing is though,

1003
00:40:23,459 --> 00:40:27,290
like, I bought one of the, you know, like the regular 30 $40 ones for the kitchen

1004
00:40:27,629 --> 00:40:30,159
and like, yeah, man, like, humidity, the toaster,

1005
00:40:30,169 --> 00:40:32,290
everything makes that smoke alarm angry.

1006
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:36,120
Ok. So you have two smoke alarms in each room or just?

1007
00:40:36,179 --> 00:40:39,600
-- Well, two in the bedroom, two in the kitchen.
-- Doesn't that seem

1008
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:41,330
unnecessary?

1009
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:44,409
Well, I needed smoke alarms while my other smoke alarms were missing for

1010
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:44,520
a

1011
00:40:46,149 --> 00:40:46,179
week.

1012
00:40:46,969 --> 00:40:48,830
Welcome to iot everybody.

1013
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,429
Yeah, exactly.

1014
00:40:50,439 --> 00:40:54,310
So, they haven't false alarmed yet, but it's only been like a week or two.

1015
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:56,169
So I have to say I'm not very impressed

1016
00:40:56,179 --> 00:40:58,050
with Nest though because there's been apart from like,

1017
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,110
oh, yeah, we know that's a problem.

1018
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,090
Here's some new ones.

1019
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,330
-- Uh,
-- what else are they gonna do?

1020
00:41:03,939 --> 00:41:08,030
Well, just maybe actually offer me some guarantee that these aren't garbage.

1021
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,830
I mean, or

1022
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,530
what, and part of what me wonders is, uh,

1023
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,790
how many other people suffered this,

1024
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,110
you certainly aren't the only one.

1025
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,639
And I also don't expect them to ever guarantee anything because the

1026
00:41:19,649 --> 00:41:22,879
problem being when you start guaranteeing things in the consumer space,

1027
00:41:22,889 --> 00:41:25,100
you then have insane liability issues.

1028
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,860
But what gets me is, I mean, I had 100% failure rate and it's not like I have some

1029
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:31,620
weird situation,

1030
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,060
you know, like I just have a regular house with,

1031
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:35,649
you know, I'm not like,

1032
00:41:36,479 --> 00:41:40,409
I, I don't know, like doing whatever it is that makes smoke alarms, malfunction,

1033
00:41:40,929 --> 00:41:42,500
whatever it is that

1034
00:41:42,659 --> 00:41:42,860
makes

1035
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:46,110
cooking meth in the basement. Maybe, I don't know.

1036
00:41:46,649 --> 00:41:47,659
But, um,

1037
00:41:47,959 --> 00:41:50,189
you know, that's, that's, that's what gets me right is like,

1038
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:52,459
how many other people suffered this? I, I don't know.

1039
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:53,229
And that's what gets me is,

1040
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:56,389
I really wonder what these iot failure rates are like right now my bathroom scale,

1041
00:41:56,399 --> 00:41:58,639
it keeps turning itself on and then runs the battery down.

1042
00:41:59,909 --> 00:42:02,280
So my bathroom scale my stupid area.

1043
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:05,020
-- And so
-- now because the battery is dead, you can't weigh yourself.

1044
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:05,649
Yeah.

1045
00:42:05,949 --> 00:42:07,209
You know, so,

1046
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,580
yeah, I mean, it's just like I, I'm not real impressed with this. Iot

1047
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,649
not super impressed.

1048
00:42:14,129 --> 00:42:18,760
All right. So this is vaguely related.

1049
00:42:19,189 --> 00:42:21,219
So the, the air raid sirens,

1050
00:42:22,419 --> 00:42:22,649
not the air

1051
00:42:24,439 --> 00:42:24,850
sirens.

1052
00:42:24,989 --> 00:42:25,540
And

1053
00:42:25,909 --> 00:42:27,729
so for those of you who haven't heard this story,

1054
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:31,060
uh, essentially some, they're blaming hackers, which maybe it was,

1055
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,209
maybe it wasn't, doesn't matter,

1056
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:35,889
hackers broke into the warning siren system in Dallas,

1057
00:42:35,899 --> 00:42:37,889
Texas apparently and turned them on at like midnight.

1058
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,010
And now generally speaking, if warning sirens go off at midnight,

1059
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,540
it's because something terrible has happened.

1060
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:46,709
And I'm sure a lot of people woke up and, like, took cover, we'll say,

1061
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:48,669
because this is also kind of tornado season,

1062
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:50,250
which is what you'd expect to be going on.

1063
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:54,449
And they managed to get them turned off after it sounds like

1064
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:56,000
a significant amount of time.

1065
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:58,560
-- But then,
-- but they had to, like, turn them off.

1066
00:42:59,149 --> 00:43:01,649
And that's the thing, if you read between the lines,

1067
00:43:01,659 --> 00:43:04,370
it sounds like they disabled the entire system in a

1068
00:43:04,379 --> 00:43:06,479
manner that it could not be re enabled again.

1069
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:07,560
And

1070
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:11,020
that's, I, I mean, this is kind of like you, with your smoke alarms,

1071
00:43:11,189 --> 00:43:13,600
you bought more smoke alarms because

1072
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:14,620
when

1073
00:43:16,129 --> 00:43:16,860
that too, right.

1074
00:43:16,949 --> 00:43:20,100
But the point being you took them away and sent them off,

1075
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:22,530
you now had zero smoke alarms and that's basically

1076
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:24,580
what happened in da if there was a legitimate

1077
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:25,810
emergency,

1078
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,100
what would they have done?

1079
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:28,689
And everybody

1080
00:43:29,379 --> 00:43:33,479
that actually works. I, I've gotten text before

1081
00:43:33,959 --> 00:43:38,040
with, uh, from, from various things and, and whatever

1082
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:41,419
you could argue that it doesn't cover everybody and, and some people,

1083
00:43:41,429 --> 00:43:42,659
-- their phones might be off,
-- whatever it,

1084
00:43:43,949 --> 00:43:46,959
it would probably be acceptable as well.

1085
00:43:46,979 --> 00:43:49,580
-- Yeah, they, they should have that set up anyway.
-- See what's interesting to me about.

1086
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:51,020
This is we used to live in a world without

1087
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:53,679
911 that's only about 30 years old at this point.

1088
00:43:54,209 --> 00:43:56,820
-- That is true, isn't it?
-- I mean,

1089
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:57,500
you think

1090
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:57,879
about it?

1091
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:00,949
The world has become a lot safer things to 911

1092
00:44:01,209 --> 00:44:02,429
as a concept, you know?

1093
00:44:02,949 --> 00:44:04,610
And I mean,

1094
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:07,050
I, I remember watching those old, uh, you know,

1095
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,709
those older films in the fifties and sixties.

1096
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:08,850
Right.

1097
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,320
Where somebody would get hurt and it'd be like, you know,

1098
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:12,780
they just load the guy up in a car and drive him to the hospital.

1099
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:13,370
Right.

1100
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:16,510
Right. Well, I mean, ok, let's face it too in the fifties and sixties.

1101
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,739
If, if you were hurt badly enough.

1102
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:21,219
I mean, medicine was essentially witchcraft at that point. And,

1103
00:44:21,379 --> 00:44:24,949
you know, that's one of the things I love is you look at even 3040 years ago,

1104
00:44:25,419 --> 00:44:26,870
medicine was kind of a mess.

1105
00:44:26,879 --> 00:44:29,889
And so you think in 30 or 40 more years they're going to look at us and say, you know,

1106
00:44:29,899 --> 00:44:30,969
those people were savages.

1107
00:44:30,979 --> 00:44:31,850
How did they survive?

1108
00:44:32,399 --> 00:44:35,030
And it's fascinating how that works and, and, you know,

1109
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,750
hopefully that's how IOT is when in 30 years we look back at IOT and be like,

1110
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,889
oh my goodness, those people are banging rocks together.

1111
00:44:40,899 --> 00:44:41,850
This is madness.

1112
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:42,550
Well,

1113
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,399
and actually this leads to a nice story that Iot bricking

1114
00:44:45,409 --> 00:44:48,699
malware that goes around and uses it logs in by its

1115
00:44:48,949 --> 00:44:50,929
helmet using known passwords and stuff.

1116
00:44:50,939 --> 00:44:53,810
And then like, basically wipes the file system.

1117
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:56,169
Like it basically, I think it was doing like DD,

1118
00:44:56,379 --> 00:45:00,469
you know, input files, DEV, random output file is like DEV slash whatever

1119
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:03,310
and it does a bunch of these to basically break the device.

1120
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:04,469
And

1121
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:08,439
part of me wonders, you know, between refresh rates being what they are.

1122
00:45:08,449 --> 00:45:11,429
Um, you know, smoke alarms are supposed to be replaced every 10 years.

1123
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:12,669
Um,

1124
00:45:13,469 --> 00:45:15,080
you know, things like that bathroom scales,

1125
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:17,479
I don't know what the standard replacement cycle for bathroom scale.

1126
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:18,320
The

1127
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:18,719
standard

1128
00:45:18,889 --> 00:45:21,500
cycle is never if you have a normal bathroom scale.

1129
00:45:21,899 --> 00:45:22,120
Like,

1130
00:45:22,129 --> 00:45:25,219
like my grandmother's bathroom scale who is like

1131
00:45:25,229 --> 00:45:27,250
she was like 95 when she passed away.

1132
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:30,209
Like it was the same one I think she bought in, in 1920.

1133
00:45:30,959 --> 00:45:34,919
But um I can't help but wonder, you know, people write a couple of these. Um

1134
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,300
because by definition,

1135
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:38,090
it's the products with the well known flaws that

1136
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,770
are garbage that are going to be well,

1137
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,689
relatively easy to wipe off the internet,

1138
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:43,949
you know,

1139
00:45:44,629 --> 00:45:44,659
face

1140
00:45:44,879 --> 00:45:46,659
to scan the entire internet. Now,

1141
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:51,189
you know, using things like Z scanner mass scan, you can scan the entire I PV for,

1142
00:45:51,669 --> 00:45:56,469
-- you can scan the entire I PV for address space in about 10 to 15 minutes. Now.
-- I know.

1143
00:45:56,479 --> 00:46:00,350
I know, but it's still, this is, this is vigilante justice and

1144
00:46:00,689 --> 00:46:03,959
vigilante justice isn't justice. But I'm also not.

1145
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,610
-- No,
-- it isn't a manufacturer

1146
00:46:07,129 --> 00:46:08,429
that's got to be illegal.

1147
00:46:09,189 --> 00:46:11,209
-- It's completely illegal,
-- but it's certainly not

1148
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:11,360
a

1149
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:11,760
manufacturer

1150
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:14,459
-- because why would they care? Right. They, they already
-- saw

1151
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:14,739
the

1152
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:15,179
refs

1153
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,000
or other vendors,

1154
00:46:18,469 --> 00:46:19,429
other vendors look bad,

1155
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:20,310
man.

1156
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:22,959
You think somebody wouldn't stoop to that

1157
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,149
somewhere on the globe.

1158
00:46:25,489 --> 00:46:27,159
See, that's the beauty of this kind of attack.

1159
00:46:27,169 --> 00:46:29,760
It only takes one manufacturer to say to one guy, you know, go

1160
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:32,919
get the, go hire somebody to do something deniable.

1161
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:35,919
It's not,

1162
00:46:36,979 --> 00:46:40,729
it's not impossible. But I would think the, the cost

1163
00:46:41,169 --> 00:46:44,360
in terms of risk, the cost of being caught

1164
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:47,360
far outweighs any potential benefit. I think,

1165
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:49,409
I don't know. Look at the Marae

1166
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:49,610
bot

1167
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:49,850
net.

1168
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:50,850
Have we caught that guy

1169
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:51,070
yet?

1170
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:53,360
But that wasn't a manufacturer.

1171
00:46:53,909 --> 00:46:55,120
We don't know,

1172
00:46:56,949 --> 00:47:01,479
-- why don't we just blame Richard Nixon. Then you can't prove it wasn't him.
-- So

1173
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,280
I'm not saying it was a manufacturer but I'm just

1174
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:05,330
saying like there's a lot of this stuff that where,

1175
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:08,370
or even if they do know who it is, they're in a country where the police don't care.

1176
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:11,790
-- There,
-- there is some of that and, oh, my goodness, this is.

1177
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:15,129
Anyway. Anyway, here's, here's the thing

1178
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:16,199
that

1179
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:20,179
I want to come back to these sirens because I think we've gone to a bad place. But

1180
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:21,239
so

1181
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:23,790
as more and more of these kind of industrial

1182
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,409
control systems continue to be attached to the internet.

1183
00:47:26,989 --> 00:47:27,689
We,

1184
00:47:28,459 --> 00:47:31,879
we often don't have in place. Kind of what happens if,

1185
00:47:32,219 --> 00:47:34,610
and, and in this instance it was hackers,

1186
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,530
but like

1187
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:39,120
what happens if you have an interconnected warning system

1188
00:47:39,429 --> 00:47:40,000
and

1189
00:47:40,479 --> 00:47:42,899
somehow something goes wrong and they all go off

1190
00:47:43,149 --> 00:47:44,040
and you don't know. You know,

1191
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:47,689
it, it is, it sounds like there, there's no safeguards built into this stuff.

1192
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:48,500
And I think that's true of,

1193
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:52,510
kind of security in general is we often don't have safeguards in place.

1194
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:55,100
I mean, if something terrible happens, what do you do next?

1195
00:47:55,389 --> 00:47:56,219
We don't know,

1196
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:59,070
by definition if there's a bug or a glitch, it's,

1197
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,280
it's an unanticipated behavior or an UN.

1198
00:48:02,429 --> 00:48:03,889
Ok. Yes. You know, I was waiting,

1199
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:07,350
I was waiting for you to say that actually because I'm going to tie this into,

1200
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:08,229
uh,

1201
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:10,810
airline disasters because you keep bringing them up and

1202
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,070
now it's my turn to bring them up.

1203
00:48:12,149 --> 00:48:12,739
So

1204
00:48:12,879 --> 00:48:14,870
when something goes wrong on an airplane,

1205
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:20,669
they have all these processes in checklists to, first of all identify the issue

1206
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:22,899
and then calmly do something about it in

1207
00:48:22,909 --> 00:48:24,899
a manner that doesn't instantly crash the plane.

1208
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,270
And in computer security,

1209
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,790
we basically have like push the self destruct button

1210
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,629
and everybody run like that's all we have.

1211
00:48:31,639 --> 00:48:32,070
Right.

1212
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:32,870
And,

1213
00:48:33,389 --> 00:48:33,919
and I, I,

1214
00:48:34,209 --> 00:48:36,949
-- so here's, here's what I wonder that
-- concept. Well, the concept of,

1215
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:39,629
you know, fly the plane first and

1216
00:48:40,189 --> 00:48:43,139
troubleshoot the problem second because there's been cases where, yeah,

1217
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:44,050
they literally, uh,

1218
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:47,750
one was a faulty bulb in an instrument and they spent so much time fiddling with it.

1219
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,070
They crashed into a swamp,

1220
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,550
right. So bad cockpit management, bad, you know,

1221
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:53,120
but

1222
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:57,290
the point being, you know, is that in computing terms, what does, you know,

1223
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,780
fly the plane first look like?

1224
00:48:58,790 --> 00:48:59,570
And the problem is though,

1225
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:02,280
is a computer system is not something where you can just like,

1226
00:49:03,219 --> 00:49:06,610
kind of sort of reset it to a known good state because if you could do that,

1227
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:07,280
you would have done that,

1228
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:10,719
but you can't necessarily reset a plane to a known good state.

1229
00:49:10,729 --> 00:49:11,949
I mean, if an engine starts

1230
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:14,550
pulling in some,

1231
00:49:14,679 --> 00:49:17,840
in some cases, they do that, like, they literally will just start pulling breakers

1232
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,270
and see when the prom goes away.

1233
00:49:20,659 --> 00:49:21,300
Like literally,

1234
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:22,939
that's one of the standard troubleshooting tips for

1235
00:49:22,949 --> 00:49:25,949
electrical stuff is like literally pull a fuse.

1236
00:49:25,959 --> 00:49:28,669
Did the prom go away? No, put the fuse back in, try the next one,

1237
00:49:30,669 --> 00:49:31,209
Dan.

1238
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:34,449
You know, although how many times have we done that with,

1239
00:49:34,459 --> 00:49:38,280
with security where you just start shutting things off or segmenting networks or,

1240
00:49:38,659 --> 00:49:40,639
or whatnot, trying to figure out what's happening.

1241
00:49:40,649 --> 00:49:43,060
-- I, I don't think that's out of the question
-- necessarily,

1242
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:43,570
but

1243
00:49:43,739 --> 00:49:45,360
we don't, yeah, we don't have a good uh

1244
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:49,530
most networks don't have a good inventory or topology map, let alone, you know,

1245
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:51,010
something where they could clearly,

1246
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,370
here's how we're going to do it, you know.

1247
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:59,169
Yeah, I guess where it all ends is I feel like this is a problem

1248
00:49:59,469 --> 00:50:00,790
with an immature industry

1249
00:50:00,979 --> 00:50:03,600
which we are, we are totally immature

1250
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:04,679
and,

1251
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:07,209
but here, here's the thing I wonder, OK is

1252
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,360
how did the airlines become mature?

1253
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:16,639
So from what I've seen in red part of it was forced on them uh

1254
00:50:16,879 --> 00:50:18,080
in the form of regulation.

1255
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:19,439
Um,

1256
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:22,550
and some, like some airlines did,

1257
00:50:22,969 --> 00:50:26,219
uh, essentially try to have good safety records and good, you know,

1258
00:50:26,229 --> 00:50:28,040
to be known for their safety.

1259
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:33,020
Uh, a lot of airlines don't care or, you know, they're, when you,

1260
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:36,159
when they do these investigations it's just like constant, you know,

1261
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,320
uh, this one,

1262
00:50:37,689 --> 00:50:39,639
airline in Southeast Asia, you know, their,

1263
00:50:39,649 --> 00:50:42,520
their training program was found to be totally inadequate.

1264
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:43,040
Like they,

1265
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:46,000
they just didn't train for certain types of situations

1266
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:48,919
which in the industry are generally trained for,

1267
00:50:48,929 --> 00:50:49,310
you know,

1268
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:51,649
um, or in one case,

1269
00:50:51,659 --> 00:50:52,989
I think it was something like they only got eight

1270
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,060
hours of training on a certain type of problem,

1271
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:55,489
you know.

1272
00:50:55,889 --> 00:50:58,169
So it, it, the problem is, it still varies and,

1273
00:50:58,179 --> 00:50:59,929
and that will always be the problem in computing, right?

1274
00:50:59,939 --> 00:51:00,330
Like

1275
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:04,959
internationally, you know, providers in, say America with PC I and stuff, you know,

1276
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:08,100
placed on them might be better than, you know, providers in some,

1277
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:11,810
like eastern European country where, you know, law, what is that?

1278
00:51:12,439 --> 00:51:14,830
Right? But I guess the trick then is

1279
00:51:15,219 --> 00:51:19,030
in, in the airline industry, if I'm not flying on airplanes in Asia,

1280
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,429
I don't have to really care

1281
00:51:21,209 --> 00:51:21,280
in

1282
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:21,840
general

1283
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,060
Africa is about

1284
00:51:23,179 --> 00:51:25,810
if you look at airline disaster stats, basically, if you,

1285
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:28,709
if you take Africa out of the equation that the numbers get much better.

1286
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:32,070
Ok. So regardless. All right, I'm not flying on airplanes in Africa either.

1287
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,350
And so

1288
00:51:33,939 --> 00:51:36,699
that's great. The problem is your data might be on some,

1289
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:41,439
not even the data you can have nefarious people literally anywhere in the world

1290
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:42,219
that can.

1291
00:51:42,409 --> 00:51:45,719
It, it's kind of like actually someone asked me about this this weekend

1292
00:51:46,219 --> 00:51:48,399
and I said, imagine if you,

1293
00:51:48,409 --> 00:51:52,409
you literally every thief had access to your front door any time they wanted it,

1294
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:56,070
right? How long do you think your house would not be broken into?

1295
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:58,520
And they looked at me in horror for even suggesting that

1296
00:51:58,979 --> 00:52:00,300
that's the internet, right?

1297
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:03,110
Like every bad guy on the internet can basically access whatever

1298
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,479
they want anywhere at any time because that's how it works.

1299
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,270
Well, that's the benefit of this thing,

1300
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,020
you know, just like phones,

1301
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:12,909
the benefit of phones is anybody can talk to anybody pretty cheaply.

1302
00:52:12,979 --> 00:52:14,520
And now we have tons of phone fraud, you know.

1303
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:16,820
Hi, this is so, and so calling from Microsoft,

1304
00:52:17,659 --> 00:52:19,350
you know. Yeah, that's true. That's

1305
00:52:19,459 --> 00:52:22,149
true. Or even better. Uh, did you just read this weekend?

1306
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:26,679
The, uh, the IRS will be outsourcing debt collection to private agencies.

1307
00:52:26,689 --> 00:52:28,560
I'm sure that won't go horribly wrong.

1308
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:32,530
And I'm just, I mean, ignoring all the, the potential issues for abuse and whatnot.

1309
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:32,899
But

1310
00:52:33,169 --> 00:52:35,709
traditionally, you know, it's been very simple.

1311
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:38,550
The IRS does not phone you, they don't, you know what I

1312
00:52:38,689 --> 00:52:41,310
mean? Like they send you register. Yeah, they send you registered mail stuff and,

1313
00:52:41,649 --> 00:52:41,949
you know,

1314
00:52:41,959 --> 00:52:45,350
and now we're going to be having threatening phone calls that are legitimate or,

1315
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,689
or maybe not, you know,

1316
00:52:47,139 --> 00:52:48,909
um like what gets me in Canada,

1317
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,850
like what gets me in Canada revenue? Canada has repeatedly stated.

1318
00:52:51,909 --> 00:52:53,169
We will not call you,

1319
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,590
we will not email you,

1320
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,689
we will send you nasty letters in those little

1321
00:52:56,699 --> 00:52:59,199
brown envelopes and if you don't respond to them,

1322
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:00,729
we'll, well, we'll do something

1323
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:03,500
but you know, they repeatedly stated this because,

1324
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:04,409
you know,

1325
00:53:04,419 --> 00:53:05,949
they've now got this thing where people are

1326
00:53:05,959 --> 00:53:08,639
buying itunes gift cards to pay their taxes.

1327
00:53:08,649 --> 00:53:11,100
Supposedly, you know, somebody calls them to threaten them and,

1328
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,010
and,

1329
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:14,770
you know, and, and it's gotten to the point now where I know, um,

1330
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:18,560
at least in a lot of Canada now, a lot of retailers will only sell you a certain,

1331
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,530
you know, a couple of 100 bucks in gift cards

1332
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:23,989
per day because no, because generally speaking,

1333
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,050
somebody comes in and wants to buy $5000 worth of itunes gift cards

1334
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:28,159
are,

1335
00:53:28,629 --> 00:53:31,729
yeah, chances are they're getting scammed and they're not just like going nuts,

1336
00:53:31,739 --> 00:53:34,570
you know, with $5000 in gifts for their friends or whatever,

1337
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:39,070
you know, and same thing for, um, some of these other sort of cash equivalent things,

1338
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:39,409
you know.

1339
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:41,590
Oh, and a big thing. Oh, I love this.

1340
00:53:41,909 --> 00:53:42,429
Magic.

1341
00:53:42,439 --> 00:53:46,850
The gathering cards now are being purchased using like fake credit cards and stuff

1342
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:51,110
because basically magic, the gathering cards are cash. They're fungible, right?

1343
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,810
You can get, you can make those things on ebay

1344
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:56,959
and I was just reading into them because my, my son is getting into these games. And so

1345
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:59,479
this guy wrote a big long article about how he was

1346
00:53:59,489 --> 00:54:02,070
one of the original sort of magic the gathering card counterfeiters.

1347
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,139
Like this is 10 years ago.

1348
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:07,810
And he would go to these events, you know, these magic, the gathering tournaments

1349
00:54:08,149 --> 00:54:11,060
to sell his fake cards and he never did the expensive cards. Right.

1350
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:14,739
He would do cards that were like 50 100 $200 or whatever. Right.

1351
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:15,850
Because if you're selling like a, you know,

1352
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:18,280
a $30,000 black lotus and it turns out to be fake,

1353
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:18,760
you know,

1354
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:21,860
chances are the police might actually listen to you when you explain it to them,

1355
00:54:21,879 --> 00:54:24,350
you know, versus like a $50 card, they're going to be like,

1356
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,060
-- you fill out this report and like, please
-- go

1357
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:26,439
away,

1358
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:27,350
we'll never come.

1359
00:54:28,659 --> 00:54:31,500
And it's funny to me because I bet if it was trading cards, like baseball cards,

1360
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:34,469
they would maybe understand better and they're like the exact same thing.

1361
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:35,310
But I digress.

1362
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:38,810
So this guy would go to these tournaments and, you know, try and sell these fake cards

1363
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:39,830
and he found that,

1364
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:42,250
you know what his number one method was to deal with people who

1365
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:44,750
-- are a bit suspicious of him for selling these cards
-- sort of cheap.

1366
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,830
I bet he

1367
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,260
gave them cheaper cards for free.

1368
00:54:48,679 --> 00:54:50,080
-- Now what he
-- said they were stolen,

1369
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,500
they were stolen,

1370
00:54:51,729 --> 00:54:52,570
he said they were stolen.

1371
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,570
He's like, oh, well, actually the truth is I just,

1372
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:57,790
I stole this backpack out of a locked car and I just need to move these cards.

1373
00:54:58,189 --> 00:55:00,489
That's why I'm selling them so cheap and, and he said,

1374
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,010
like the majority of the people would then buy them

1375
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:05,929
and, and on his end, you know, morally and ethically,

1376
00:55:05,939 --> 00:55:07,770
he felt a lot better about himself

1377
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:10,610
and, and part of me was wondering morally and ethically, you know,

1378
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:12,290
it's like you're selling a counterfeit good to

1379
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,489
people who think they're buying stolen goods cheap.

1380
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:16,310
Uh,

1381
00:55:17,229 --> 00:55:21,520
you know, part of me is just like, ok, they're both uh uh reprehensible.

1382
00:55:21,729 --> 00:55:26,149
Um, and he actually stopped because he was doing Pokemon cards and he sold, you know,

1383
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:28,620
to adults and then a 12 year old came up to him and he's just like, sorry,

1384
00:55:28,629 --> 00:55:29,489
I'm all out and then he

1385
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:31,399
quit or so he says, but

1386
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:35,250
so I recently on Saturday went to the dollar dollar

1387
00:55:35,449 --> 00:55:38,879
rama, sorry, it's a dollar store and they had magic, the gathering cards, uh,

1388
00:55:38,889 --> 00:55:40,320
packs of 15 for a buck.

1389
00:55:40,330 --> 00:55:40,830
So I'm like, sweet,

1390
00:55:40,949 --> 00:55:41,620
you know, like,

1391
00:55:42,199 --> 00:55:43,649
and so I bought four packs.

1392
00:55:44,379 --> 00:55:46,590
I opened up these four packs, uh, 15 cards each.

1393
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:49,310
So 60 cards in total, three of them are printed,

1394
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,000
like with the character stuff on both sides.

1395
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:52,129
Totally legit.

1396
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:56,100
Right. So right off the bat there, I'm a little bit suspicious of these cards.

1397
00:55:56,379 --> 00:55:58,379
Uh, did the rip test, ripped a bunch of them in half.

1398
00:55:58,389 --> 00:56:00,800
They have that blue stuff in the middle. Did the light test? The light

1399
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,669
seems to be,

1400
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,159
it doesn't seem to be legit.

1401
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:09,350
Uh And then I, my little camera magnifying lens thing finally arrived this morning.

1402
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,810
So I took a picture and posted it on my twitter of the, um, what you

1403
00:56:11,919 --> 00:56:12,850
call the rosettes,

1404
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:15,689
you know, the, the, the little printing artifacts.

1405
00:56:15,969 --> 00:56:16,649
Um

1406
00:56:17,419 --> 00:56:19,840
And from what I've seen, they, they seem to be pretty legit.

1407
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:22,840
So you're saying these cards basically check out,

1408
00:56:23,239 --> 00:56:23,760
well,

1409
00:56:23,889 --> 00:56:26,729
obviously, like the fact that three of them were printed with the characters

1410
00:56:26,919 --> 00:56:26,939
of

1411
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:29,100
these are clearly fake cards,

1412
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:29,739
but

1413
00:56:29,989 --> 00:56:33,280
they got the blue stuff. They kind of passed the light test and

1414
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,159
I'm not an expert but the,

1415
00:56:35,169 --> 00:56:37,709
the rosettes look and the print quality is like

1416
00:56:37,719 --> 00:56:39,800
these obviously weren't run off on a laser,

1417
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:41,580
you know, or an ink jet printer.

1418
00:56:41,879 --> 00:56:45,360
Um, and also judging by the way, the corners are cut, the corners are cut and,

1419
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:49,689
and from what I've read online, they, they do appear to fall into the fake camp,

1420
00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:53,439
um, because they're not cut as cleanly as the normal cards.

1421
00:56:53,699 --> 00:56:54,879
But here's what gets me,

1422
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,959
these are cards that are selling at retail for less

1423
00:56:57,969 --> 00:57:01,300
-- than seven cents per card
-- and they're really expensive usually.

1424
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,020
Well, and, and so the point is

1425
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:06,840
somebody is counterfeiting these cards

1426
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,060
and making money,

1427
00:57:09,649 --> 00:57:11,350
like, and they're selling them wholesale to the

1428
00:57:11,689 --> 00:57:12,540
dollarama chain

1429
00:57:13,399 --> 00:57:15,169
who's buying them for, you know,

1430
00:57:15,179 --> 00:57:18,179
probably at most half of what they're selling them for.

1431
00:57:18,479 --> 00:57:18,489
Uh,

1432
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:23,260
it's also conceivable that it is one of the legitimate magic printers

1433
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:27,330
that has just erased quality control because they don't need to care.

1434
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:30,989
But, I mean, a 5% failure rate where the cards are printed on both sides with the,

1435
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:34,540
you know, with the character info and they don't have like the magic deck masters

1436
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:36,649
printing on one side. Like that's, that's,

1437
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:39,110
-- that's a 5% failure rate. That's, yeah, but
-- what do they care?

1438
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,850
They're selling pirate cards.

1439
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:44,270
I mean, because you have to remember a lot of these organizations, they,

1440
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:45,590
they get this stuff printed

1441
00:57:45,979 --> 00:57:48,429
in, we'll say a country that, that is

1442
00:57:49,129 --> 00:57:52,199
often times not uh super friendly

1443
00:57:52,489 --> 00:57:53,030
to China

1444
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:55,929
maybe.

1445
00:57:56,419 --> 00:57:57,020
And,

1446
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,570
and it is not uncommon for the actual

1447
00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:00,540
market.

1448
00:58:00,879 --> 00:58:03,550
But then those cards would, you would think that they would be cut, right?

1449
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,360
And they would be using the correct paper and stuff. So

1450
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,590
I'm just fascinated because

1451
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:12,129
apparently you can make money counterfeiting cards that like

1452
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:14,530
retail for less than seven cents a card and there's

1453
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:16,770
enough profit margin in there to make it worthwhile doing.

1454
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:19,169
That's what blows me away. Right.

1455
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:23,090
You know, I can certainly see, you know, counterfeiting a $500 card. Sure, easy.

1456
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:23,800
You know, you counterfeit th

1457
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:26,479
oh and that's the other thing is then I was looking on uh what was it?

1458
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:26,929
Alibaba

1459
00:58:27,209 --> 00:58:30,280
actually contact wizards of the coast

1460
00:58:30,489 --> 00:58:30,879
and

1461
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:31,530
I was actually going

1462
00:58:31,639 --> 00:58:31,850
to do

1463
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:36,679
this and it would be really fun to follow this and see if you can chase it.

1464
00:58:37,179 --> 00:58:37,429
Well,

1465
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:39,590
actually what I'm going to do today is I'm actually going to go back

1466
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,560
to the store and buy a couple more packs of these and leave them sealed

1467
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:44,070
and I wanted to take one.

1468
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:47,370
there's actually a card store, a few blocks away from me like that has, you know,

1469
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:50,179
tournaments on every Saturday afternoon and like legit, you know,

1470
00:58:50,189 --> 00:58:52,419
it's a legitimate card store game store, right?

1471
00:58:52,739 --> 00:58:54,899
And I want to take them a sealed pack of these things and be like, you know,

1472
00:58:54,909 --> 00:58:55,719
what's the deal with this?

1473
00:58:55,729 --> 00:58:55,939
Right?

1474
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:58,260
-- Like, are these counterfeit because they sure as hell,
-- yeah,

1475
00:58:58,270 --> 00:59:01,840
-- they might know
-- actually, like a 5% failure rate on the printing seems

1476
00:59:01,989 --> 00:59:03,530
well, you can't say 5%.

1477
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,500
You need to have like,

1478
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:08,040
literally hundreds of thousands of cards before you can even make that assumption.

1479
00:59:08,149 --> 00:59:10,229
Well, but three out of four decks so far

1480
00:59:10,989 --> 00:59:11,580
-- the
-- lottery

1481
00:59:12,449 --> 00:59:14,239
get some more or it could be the batch

1482
00:59:14,409 --> 00:59:16,239
that, that was printed, you know, whatever,

1483
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:20,510
I'd buy a handful more and just see what happens before I'd make the argument that

1484
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:25,000
it's 5% because your sample size is still too small to definitively say yes or no.

1485
00:59:25,389 --> 00:59:27,760
Well, but statistically if it is unlikely, then I've, I've,

1486
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:30,790
I need to start going to buy lottery tickets or something.

1487
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:31,520
Yes.

1488
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:34,780
That's exactly the takeaway you should hear from this and I think

1489
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:36,989
we can't end the show on a better note than that.

1490
00:59:37,219 --> 00:59:40,159
So I'll let you guys know next week. What happens? Hopefully.

1491
00:59:40,169 --> 00:59:42,239
Yeah, I can't wait, man. That'll be fascinating.

1492
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:45,320
Maybe you'll get beat up by some magic gathering players.

1493
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,909
They, they didn't look real healthy.

1494
00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:54,409
Oh, I know. I know. I'm, I'm one of them anyway. Thank you, everybody for listening.

1495
00:59:54,419 --> 00:59:55,189
Thank you, Kurt.

1496
00:59:55,199 --> 00:59:59,050
Uh If, if you want to see the show notes and any of the crazy topics, as always,

1497
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:01,010
you can go to open source security podcast.com.

1498
01:00:01,459 --> 01:00:03,979
You can find links there to Twitter and Facebook and

1499
01:00:03,989 --> 01:00:06,399
connect with Kurt and myself and ask us silly questions.

1500
01:00:06,409 --> 01:00:09,729
Maybe Kurt will post something on Twitter about his uh magic.

1501
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:12,050
The gathering beat down for his fake cards

1502
01:00:12,389 --> 01:00:13,419
and

1503
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:15,679
everybody have a great day. Kurt.

1504
01:00:15,689 --> 01:00:20,520
You have a fantastic day and good luck with your magic conquest.

1505
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:22,750
All right. Thanks folks. Enjoy the snow.

1506
01:00:23,379 --> 01:00:23,689
Not,

1507
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:27,159
no, just you just, you. All right. Thanks everybody. Bye bye.
