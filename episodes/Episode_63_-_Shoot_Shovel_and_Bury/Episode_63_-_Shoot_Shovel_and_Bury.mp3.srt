Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 63

1
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:11,470
with myself Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime,

2
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:12,260
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:12,710
Holy cow.

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:17,059
Kurt. I feel like the whole world has lit on fire all at once.

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,100
I've not been offline for a week, but I, I moved.

6
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:21,870
So I've,

7
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:25,879
I've been somewhat unaware of it apart from the continued flaming train wreck.

8
00:00:25,889 --> 00:00:27,000
That is Equifax.

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,170
That will,

10
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:29,879
we've got,

11
00:00:30,209 --> 00:00:30,309
I

12
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:32,330
bet we have a couple more months

13
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:33,840
to make,

14
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:38,299
to make some, some hay with that one. It's not going to go away anytime soon.

15
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,159
No,

16
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:41,490
it's like, well, you know, it's like a hurricane, right?

17
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,060
It's just such a big massive event.

18
00:00:43,069 --> 00:00:46,470
Even when it's over, you still have to clean up and deal with all the,

19
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,090
unless there's another hurricane right after it.

20
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:51,029
And then that's all anyone talks about.

21
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,189
And we're on like the third or fourth hurricane at this point. So,

22
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,909
uh yeah, no one even remembers the name of the first one, right?

23
00:00:58,409 --> 00:00:58,810
Yeah.

24
00:00:58,990 --> 00:00:59,189
Yeah. Yeah.

25
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,270
And, and that's kind of what I feel like is, is starting to happen here and,

26
00:01:03,599 --> 00:01:06,150
and, and so here's the question for you and this is something we,

27
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,900
we briefly talked about before we hit record was, is,

28
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:14,510
is this the new normal? I feel like everything has lit on fire and it's just

29
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,830
more fire. You know, it's not going out.

30
00:01:18,059 --> 00:01:21,370
-- I actually
-- think it's probably not that much worse than it was in past,

31
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:24,629
but part of it is there's much better coverage of it.

32
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:29,269
Uh, I suspect there was, I mean, because I know in the past a lot of these incidents,

33
00:01:29,279 --> 00:01:31,709
the response was it was like hoof and mouth disease, right.

34
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,809
Shoot shovel and burry.

35
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:38,599
So ho and melt disease is a disease that, you know, it, it affects cattle.

36
00:01:38,949 --> 00:01:42,059
And essentially the response is you shoot the cattle, dig a trench, dump them in,

37
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:42,699
cover it up.

38
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:43,180
So

39
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,279
that how you deal with

40
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:47,379
-- me.
-- It's funny you use that as the example because,

41
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:51,309
uh, I live in, in the north almost as north as you.

42
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,510
And we have. Right. Right.

43
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,949
We have that in the wild white tailed deer population here.

44
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,680
It's called chronic wasting disease.

45
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:04,099
And I think your analogy is interesting because in the cattle perspective,

46
00:02:04,309 --> 00:02:05,940
you can sort of control it.

47
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,538
But when it is a wild animal, especially a herding wild animal,

48
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:15,020
you have no control over what's going on and, and they do like all this testing,

49
00:02:15,029 --> 00:02:18,070
the new thing they're doing here, you know, God bless these people is

50
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,440
they decided that not enough people were getting their animals tested.

51
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:23,449
So they did away with the free testing.

52
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,779
And so now they're like, yeah,

53
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:27,729
if you think your animal has chronic wasting disease you shot.

54
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,100
Uh,

55
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:29,860
yeah, good luck. Right

56
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:35,339
here, there's a whole bunch of, um,

57
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:36,740
hunting zones.

58
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,880
So in Alberta, the province is split up into a variety of hunting zones, you know,

59
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:42,669
based on which animals and how many animals are present and stuff like that.

60
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:42,940
And

61
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:47,330
there's a big pile of zones in the south where, you know,

62
00:02:47,339 --> 00:02:49,029
chronic wasting disease is an issue.

63
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:52,869
And yeah, if you shoot animals there, you're heavily encouraged to get them tested,

64
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,229
but it's not mandatory.

65
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,190
Doesn't this sound like compliance? Like we encourage you to do it? Right.

66
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:02,130
But if you don't? Oh, well, and, you know, you might die. We don't know. Good luck.

67
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:02,660
Yeah.

68
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,350
Well, it's also for, you know, if,

69
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:07,500
in theory, if we get testing, then you have a good sample size and,

70
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:08,679
you know how bad things are.

71
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:09,619
Right.

72
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,039
Yeah, that too, because part of the problem is, you know,

73
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:14,460
if you have 10 people bring in 10 dead deer and they all test positive is that,

74
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,410
-- you know what I mean? Like, what, what's the, how bad is this actually?
-- Right.

75
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:19,279
Right. Right.

76
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:22,539
And I think these data breaches are kind of like that and that

77
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:27,500
part of it too is the scale of them is such that you can't hide it anymore. Right. When,

78
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,380
you know, when like 10,000 people have their details leaked.

79
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:31,169
They're not gonna, like,

80
00:03:31,179 --> 00:03:35,000
put it together and figure out that they got popped by necessarily.

81
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:35,399
Right.

82
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:38,139
But when it's millions and millions of people,

83
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:40,639
uh, you know, like the, the Home Depot thing, right.

84
00:03:40,649 --> 00:03:41,699
You can just correlate, like, oh,

85
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,119
look 100% of these people all shopped at Home Depot.

86
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:45,949
Right.

87
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,710
-- You know,
-- we can't prove

88
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:48,750
and, and

89
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:51,229
what's, what I find most interesting is, I mean,

90
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:56,550
epidemiology learned a lot of hard lessons starting. What about 200 years ago?

91
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,460
I think that's kind of when it started

92
00:04:00,059 --> 00:04:02,990
the guy with the uh water pump in London. Jeez, what was that?

93
00:04:04,589 --> 00:04:07,619
The statistician who figured out, you know, it was the water pump

94
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:10,289
that had the collar and he took the handle off the water pump and

95
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:10,869
problem

96
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:11,229
solving.

97
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:11,520
Interesting,

98
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:12,800
interesting.

99
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,690
But at the same time,

100
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:17,858
the cholera was caused maybe by the water pump.

101
00:04:17,869 --> 00:04:22,320
But in reality, the issue was people were throwing their waste out the window,

102
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:22,760
right?

103
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:23,880
Like it's, it's

104
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,109
correlation isn't necessarily causing,

105
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,070
he knew it was coming from this water pump.

106
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:32,130
So we knew where the problem was originating. At least I got you, got you.

107
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:32,730
Um

108
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:35,010
But uh and, and that's

109
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,429
the problem is, you know,

110
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:41,119
we so that if you look at the the public health system in most developed countries,

111
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:41,290
right?

112
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:44,149
We have a huge system set up to report

113
00:04:44,179 --> 00:04:47,390
disease and so we can do correlating like locally,

114
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:49,320
for example, there was a, there's a food festival.

115
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:50,690
Uh I think it was a taste of Edmonton.

116
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,589
So basically a whole bunch of vendors, you know, with food carts that kind of stuff

117
00:04:53,809 --> 00:04:55,489
set up in the park, people eat their food

118
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,549
and the one I guess was giving out free salmonella with their food,

119
00:05:00,739 --> 00:05:03,660
you know, and so like 2030 people got really sick

120
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,989
and, you know, and they're so, you know,

121
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,029
they correlated which one it was and they're warning,

122
00:05:08,179 --> 00:05:10,670
you know, if you ate at this one and while you feel sick,

123
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:12,790
go to the hospital because it's not just like a little sick,

124
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:14,309
like you could be very sick.

125
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:16,000
Um

126
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,149
Yeah, I mean, it's,

127
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,920
I feel like in computing the problem is we don't have

128
00:05:19,929 --> 00:05:22,390
good data because a lot of people hide their data,

129
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,869
right? They don't want the world to know that they got popped

130
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:32,220
and there's no central authority to really, there's no who there's no, you know,

131
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,119
CDC.

132
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:33,640
Uh

133
00:05:33,809 --> 00:05:35,399
Yes. And, and OK,

134
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,920
so I, I like where you're taking this because I, I don't think you're wrong.

135
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:45,980
And I also think the work that the CDC type of organizations do is amazing.

136
00:05:45,989 --> 00:05:47,000
It amazes me

137
00:05:47,369 --> 00:05:47,940
that

138
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,019
five people can get food poisoning and they asked them a whole

139
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:53,500
bunch of questions and then they can say something like it was,

140
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,450
it was lettuce from this grocery store.

141
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:58,750
And I think that's amazing that, that you're able to do that, right? But,

142
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:00,890
but I guess more importantly is

143
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:04,059
they know what they're looking for and they understand the problem.

144
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,239
We don't have either of those things in security today.

145
00:06:07,829 --> 00:06:07,869
I,

146
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:09,130
I agree

147
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:10,279
there's a lot of new

148
00:06:10,429 --> 00:06:10,970
attacks and stuff,

149
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,859
but there's a lot of simple stuff like where somebody

150
00:06:12,869 --> 00:06:15,760
hacked a whole pile of accounts or personal data.

151
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,489
It doesn't really matter how they hacked it. The fact is it happened.

152
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,809
Ok. I understand what you're saying.

153
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,839
And that's kind of what the have I been pawned sort of

154
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,450
set, right. Yeah.

155
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,750
But part of it, and this is my real frustration is we can live without disease.

156
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,850
We can't live without personal data and we have to share personal data otherwise.

157
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:36,089
No, no, you're, you're,

158
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,140
I think you're making a bad analogy because saying we can live without disease

159
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:40,880
is

160
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,350
that's not the problem.

161
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:46,589
The problem is we are a society and if, if humans are interacting,

162
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,529
there is disease just like existing on the internet means sharing personal data,

163
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,070
meaning your data will leak.

164
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,869
What I mean in the sense is

165
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,059
our

166
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,869
modern economy is based on

167
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,209
a high degree of transparency and efficiency.

168
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,769
So for example, if I'm going to uh sell you a car

169
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:07,269
and I make you pay upfront for it, I'm going to sell about two cars a year

170
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,250
if you're lucky,

171
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:10,709
you know.

172
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,019
So I have to be able to do credit.

173
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,450
Well, if I'm going to do credit,

174
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:17,489
I have to be able to figure out whether or not you're gonna pay me back.

175
00:07:17,869 --> 00:07:21,309
And, well, first of all, I have to figure out whether or not you can pay me back

176
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:25,250
and assuming you can pay me back. Are you actually going to?

177
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:26,730
Right. Right.

178
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,489
And that, you know, what am I going to do?

179
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,190
Get personal references, you know, talk to your boss

180
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:34,700
again, that's going to cost me tens of hours, you know, it's,

181
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:38,339
and hugely inefficient and, and it's not going to be very good or accurate.

182
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,230
Hence, we get things like Equifax where Equifax, you know,

183
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:43,869
stores data on everybody and on their

184
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,660
credit history and on their payment history and

185
00:07:45,869 --> 00:07:50,100
literally assigns you a score that basically indicates how likely

186
00:07:50,109 --> 00:07:51,959
you are to pay back money lent to you.

187
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:52,899
Yes.

188
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:53,299
You,

189
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:55,549
that

190
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,209
I,

191
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,179
-- I,
-- I, I don't have enough money to buy a house.

192
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:04,190
II, I doubt I ever will like most people in my generation, you know, we're not gonna

193
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:07,239
-- somehow save up, you know, four years of salary and
-- buy

194
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,529
a house. I'm

195
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:09,750
an old man. Don't pretend you're a millennial.

196
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:15,329
No, but even my generation, I, you know, very, it's, it's owning a house is pretty,

197
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:15,820
uh, it's,

198
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,500
it's expensive. Our parents generation all owned houses. No big deal.

199
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,809
Yes. But they, they still took out loans.

200
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,269
Yeah, exactly.

201
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,540
I mean, even, even in the land of milk and honey,

202
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:28,160
they weren't writing checks for houses.

203
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:28,500
Right.

204
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:29,299
Yeah, exactly.

205
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:33,419
And of course, it was purely, it was just hard work. That got them there.

206
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,320
So, and so the problem is like,

207
00:08:35,869 --> 00:08:37,700
what, what I was saying is we can, you know,

208
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:41,460
we can live without disease in the sense of if we all don't have Ebola, that,

209
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:42,219
that's ok.

210
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,659
But we can't live without sharing personal information because,

211
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:46,580
you know,

212
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:50,059
uh my son's school, like they need my phone number,

213
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,359
they need to be able to contact me in

214
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:56,440
case, you know, he's puking or throwing chairs or whatever. Right. Um,

215
00:08:57,229 --> 00:08:59,150
there's all these situations where we really

216
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,479
do have to share personal information,

217
00:09:00,489 --> 00:09:01,739
you know, you get in a car accident with somebody.

218
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,049
Ok. But although I guess what, you're,

219
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:09,369
yes, I, I'm trying to, my brain is processing this now and

220
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:12,150
there are various levels of personal information.

221
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:16,409
Like my phone number is basically public knowledge. It's not even hard to find.

222
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,770
And so

223
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,820
that's one level, but at the same time there's things like, uh, today

224
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,349
in, in the US, at least you have your social security number,

225
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:26,520
which is supposed to be private.

226
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,380
But thanks to

227
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,979
basically every hack in the last 10 years,

228
00:09:29,989 --> 00:09:32,659
it's like I know mine isn't private anymore.

229
00:09:32,869 --> 00:09:35,059
It's, it's, I've never actually looked for it,

230
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,119
but my suspicion is it's not hard to find.

231
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:42,299
So I moved houses and I, um, I changed DS L providers.

232
00:09:42,309 --> 00:09:42,469
Uh,

233
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:44,390
I changed to tell us because they're running fiber

234
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,690
here and I want to upgrade to the fiber.

235
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:49,479
And, um, well, actually know the crews are right out.

236
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:52,679
-- They're three blocks away right now, pulling the, uh, the fibers to the house,
-- some

237
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,619
donuts and be like, do me next.

238
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,570
Yeah.

239
00:09:57,969 --> 00:10:00,719
But so anyways I phoned tell us and I haven't been a customer of,

240
00:10:00,729 --> 00:10:02,059
tell us in like 15 years.

241
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,450
Right? Because I had shaw

242
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:04,909
and I had tech savvy and so

243
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,739
the guy, you know, he's like, ok, well, we basically have no idea who you are.

244
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,289
So like, what's your name? What's your address?

245
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:10,659
You know, and,

246
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:12,070
and obviously I'm gonna give them my real

247
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,849
address because that's where I want the service,

248
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,130
right? I can't, you know what I mean?

249
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,210
Like they tell us obviously is going to get my real

250
00:10:17,219 --> 00:10:19,500
address because they're going to send a guy out to like

251
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,700
-- around my wife.
-- It's kind of an important point,

252
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,789
right? Yeah, exactly. So, so

253
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:28,059
they're like, I'm like, he's like I need, uh, you know,

254
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,820
I need to know um your driver's license ID number.

255
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,989
I'm like, I'm not real keen about giving that out, but ok, you know, it's this,

256
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,159
it's one blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, whatever it is.

257
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,950
He's like, ok, now I need your social

258
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,760
or your social insurance number and I'm like, no,

259
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:44,619
he's like, I'm sorry, but we need two forms of government ID

260
00:10:44,849 --> 00:10:47,219
like, and please note this is over the phone.

261
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:50,010
This isn't like I was in a store showing him the thing.

262
00:10:50,429 --> 00:10:51,090
Um

263
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,280
I also discovered now they don't give you a social insurance number card anymore.

264
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:55,250
In Canada. They used to,

265
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,469
I, I have like a plastic card that's embossed with the number,

266
00:10:58,479 --> 00:10:59,590
like an old timey credit card.

267
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:01,070
And then they went, I think,

268
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,979
to a paper slip and now they just don't even bother because, like, you know what,

269
00:11:04,989 --> 00:11:06,419
you're going to show it to get into a bar.

270
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,530
Have you ever seen a US social security number?

271
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,070
That the,

272
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,260
it's like

273
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:11,460
a,

274
00:11:11,789 --> 00:11:16,080
it's flimsy paper designed specifically. So if you lose it it falls apart and like

275
00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:17,299
that, that could be

276
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:17,859
like,

277
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,799
-- yeah, they're super weak. I mean, it's
-- definitely

278
00:11:22,869 --> 00:11:23,619
in your lifetime.

279
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:24,760
Yeah.

280
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,239
So, uh,

281
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:29,789
but anyway, so he's like, we need two forms of government ID.

282
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:31,359
And I'm like, thinking first of all, ok,

283
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:34,039
what, what's the liability here?

284
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:37,059
Number one, there's going to be a piece of, tell us equipment at my end

285
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,340
that's worth about like 100 bucks, right? A DS L modem.

286
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:41,859
-- These things aren't expensive,
-- you know,

287
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:44,580
they're buying those things for probably like three bucks.

288
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,299
Right. Yeah.

289
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:48,500
Uh, secondly, there's the call out of the technician to, you know,

290
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,820
basically poke the wires.

291
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:54,020
Ok. That's, that's like 50 to 100 bucks cost, right? You know, that's fair.

292
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,460
But beyond that, there's like,

293
00:11:55,469 --> 00:11:58,840
just a minimal marginal cost for them to add me to their network.

294
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,719
So at most they're looking at, you know, 100 maybe $200

295
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,869
that they can kind of lose on me

296
00:12:05,729 --> 00:12:06,239
and,

297
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,520
but because of, you know, the way businesses work now, right.

298
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:12,390
They want to minimize their liability, they want to minimize

299
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,380
the amount of loss that they eat.

300
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,989
So they require two forms of government ID.

301
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,010
And, you know, so I gave them my health care number which again, really annoyed the

302
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:22,960
government health care. What's that?

303
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,820
Yeah. Anyways. But, um,

304
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:28,010
you know, it, it's really frustrating because I, I just want DS L,

305
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,169
I'm paying 50 bucks a month.

306
00:12:29,179 --> 00:12:30,440
It's not like I'm paying, you know, it's,

307
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,909
this isn't like some business line at like five grand

308
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,679
a month or 50 grand a month or something.

309
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,900
This is like a $50 a month home DS L line,

310
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,559
you know,

311
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,500
and the hoops I had to jump through to get it,

312
00:12:41,729 --> 00:12:45,229
you know, with giving away my personal information is I think a bit ridiculous.

313
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,479
-- But what choice do I have? Right.
-- Ok. But let's, let's think of it this way,

314
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,059
my guess.

315
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,469
And this is just a guess,

316
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:57,270
but my guess is when they started requiring two forms of government ID,

317
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:00,219
the number of delinquencies that they were seeing

318
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:03,409
in new customers dropped by a significant margin.

319
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:05,229
Well, and more to the point when, if,

320
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:08,460
if I try and get service again from them in the future,

321
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:13,070
it would be very difficult because I could, for example, use my same name,

322
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,570
but I would have to give different,

323
00:13:15,049 --> 00:13:15,239
you know,

324
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,090
forms of government ID that they would then be able

325
00:13:17,099 --> 00:13:19,030
to tie back to the other ones most likely,

326
00:13:19,869 --> 00:13:22,520
you know, and they could refuse me service effectively. Right.

327
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:23,849
And that's,

328
00:13:24,219 --> 00:13:26,349
you know, that's my frustration is that, yeah, I get that.

329
00:13:26,359 --> 00:13:28,469
It saves them money and it saves them hassle.

330
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:30,950
They don't really pass the savings on to me.

331
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,659
But, uh, regardless, but my worry is, you know, the,

332
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:39,330
the cost if they do manage to lose or leak my information to me is it's a lot of hassle.

333
00:13:41,109 --> 00:13:42,669
You know, we talked, you talked about this,

334
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:45,239
how one of the biggest problems with identity theft is,

335
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:48,739
how do I show actual personal loss versus like, oh,

336
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,419
I spent like 100 hours on the phone dealing with these people.

337
00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:52,469
Right. You know,

338
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,669
right. In, in, in all seriousness.

339
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:59,590
My, I, my, my social security number has been stolen every which way you can imagine

340
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,020
and I have yet to see any fraud against myself.

341
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:06,390
Now, granted, I keep saying that and I'm sure I'm, I'm in for a doozy now

342
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,710
and tempting fate.

343
00:14:08,469 --> 00:14:10,729
Well, I was reading on hacker news and, you know,

344
00:14:10,739 --> 00:14:12,619
these and on Reddit and these people are talking about

345
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,570
identity theft and what they've had to deal with and,

346
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,840
you know, sending certified letters to Bank of America to point out that no,

347
00:14:17,849 --> 00:14:20,619
I did not do XY and Z or,

348
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:24,700
you know, with Verizon. No, I didn't buy 10 phones,

349
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:26,099
you know, like, just,

350
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:27,530
you know,

351
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:29,260
the best part is the guy,

352
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,909
like they bought 10 phones and had them shipped to my address.

353
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:33,229
And so I had to phone Verizon security and

354
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,919
that one was actually easy because it's like,

355
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:36,419
hi, I have a box full of 10 phones.

356
00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:37,919
I didn't order. Would you like them back?

357
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,260
You know.

358
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:40,880
So

359
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,169
crazy, man.

360
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:44,020
So actually one thing that,

361
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,900
that just sprang to mind when you're talking about Verizon is

362
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,859
I am a T mobile subscriber.

363
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:51,940
And if you have

364
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:56,580
a like proper T mobile, it's not really a contract, but it's sort of a contract,

365
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,260
whatever they call it.

366
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:57,739
Now,

367
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,179
you have to give them.

368
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,219
I did not, my wife did.

369
00:15:01,469 --> 00:15:02,340
But uh well,

370
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,270
we used to have a real contract with them and

371
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,070
then they like did away with contracts and stuff,

372
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,859
but they still have a concept of prepaid and postpaid.

373
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,010
And,

374
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,900
and so actually I have a, my

375
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:15,580
fi I use when I travel and my, my

376
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:16,710
fi is prepaid

377
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,489
and the reason it's prepaid for the month in advance, right?

378
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,090
And it's prepaid because I can only put it on postpaid

379
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:26,520
if I give them my social security number, which I said no.

380
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:30,330
And I could jump through a bunch of hoops and like add it to my existing account.

381
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,429
But then I would,

382
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,250
we have like some ancient rate locked in for dirt freaking cheap for,

383
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,210
for unlimited data.

384
00:15:36,219 --> 00:15:36,690
So I'm

385
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:41,729
I'm not touching that ever right? Until they make me. So anyway, anyway,

386
00:15:41,869 --> 00:15:42,429
Uh, right.

387
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,729
If you, if you're unwilling to work with them, they'll still give you an account,

388
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,200
but it's prepaid and obviously if they don't pay the bill,

389
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,349
I just turn it off and whoop.

390
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:50,770
You do, no one cares.

391
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,650
Which is, which is kind of cool actually.

392
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:57,549
Yeah. Well, and, you know, I get it because this makes business more efficient.

393
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:00,150
They're less likely to have losses that they have to eat more to the point,

394
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,309
the losses that they do have to eat are cheaper and easier to deal with.

395
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:04,679
You know,

396
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:08,500
like you said, we just turn it off. Ok. That's a, you know, that's a crap account.

397
00:16:09,489 --> 00:16:11,250
Right. And actually, you know, it's really cool. They did too.

398
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,250
And this was really clever is one time I,

399
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,229
I just didn't pay my bill and I was out of town or something.

400
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:17,950
Right? I forget the details and

401
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,809
I go to use it and I'm thinking it's not working. Right.

402
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,109
So anyway, I called him up and I said, uh, hey, my, my, my, I is broke and they said, oh,

403
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:25,890
you didn't pay us.

404
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,989
I said, oh, ok. Well, whatever, here's my credit card number, right?

405
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,030
Uh Turn it back up

406
00:16:29,809 --> 00:16:34,440
and they of course only re enable the service to the end of the billing cycle.

407
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,469
Like they didn't add 30 days.

408
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:40,429
So you figure, right. Which is brilliant, right? If you miss half a month

409
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,000
and you call them now you're basically paying for

410
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:45,179
the full month of service for a half month.

411
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:45,549
It's

412
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,570
right on, you know, good for them.

413
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,179
Yeah. No, I mean, this is sharp business.

414
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,590
I mean, this is, you know, businesses that do,

415
00:16:53,599 --> 00:16:56,369
that will have a few million dollars more than the businesses that don't.

416
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:59,000
I would hope so. And, and, yeah, I dig it

417
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,799
so, but that's the problem. Right is

418
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,680
we can't secure this personal information because by definition,

419
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:07,449
I have to share it with a ton of people

420
00:17:07,739 --> 00:17:12,800
so that we can have a, a modern economy that's, you know, really efficient and

421
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,449
so like literally, you know, people go out and they buy a car in an afternoon,

422
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:18,270
takes them an hour.

423
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,880
Yeah, probably, you know.

424
00:17:21,598 --> 00:17:22,050
Right. I mean,

425
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,439
I look at this whole house thing and like it's a few

426
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:26,199
10,

427
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:28,209
it's like 10 or 20 hours in total of

428
00:17:28,219 --> 00:17:31,349
paperwork and stuff to like do all the financial stuff

429
00:17:32,209 --> 00:17:33,709
and my, you know, and, and a

430
00:17:33,849 --> 00:17:38,000
lot of banks and mortgage brokers now will just do it entirely online,

431
00:17:39,229 --> 00:17:42,270
you know, that's incredibly amazing and efficient, you know,

432
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,329
when you think about it,

433
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:44,750
you do.

434
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,689
So

435
00:17:47,979 --> 00:17:50,589
we, yeah, I, I don't think we can go back to

436
00:17:50,989 --> 00:17:51,520
like,

437
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:55,510
I am going to need five references and I'm going to call them in to have interviews is,

438
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:59,819
is Josh a good guy, like does he, you know, he, oh, he has a dog?

439
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,979
That's good. That's, you know, plus five points

440
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,849
and uh you know, that's just not gonna happen. So the problem is

441
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:06,670
we,

442
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:09,819
we've built these systems that rely on this information being secret.

443
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:11,709
Like, you know, you phone the gas company, your phone,

444
00:18:11,719 --> 00:18:13,920
whatever company they're like, ok, I need to verify your identity, you know,

445
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,750
like what's your name and your postal code

446
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,000
and your billing number? And it's like, but all that stuff's on the mail that you send

447
00:18:19,189 --> 00:18:19,219
up,

448
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,089
you know?

449
00:18:20,609 --> 00:18:21,219
I know.

450
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:25,160
I mean, that's, to me, one of the biggest things for electronic billing is now,

451
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,229
-- I don't have to worry about
-- mail

452
00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:29,719
theft or, or, you know what my favorite is I called the cable company one time

453
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
and they said,

454
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,939
uh, what's your pin number? And I said, I don't think I have one.

455
00:18:33,949 --> 00:18:36,719
They said, oh, no, you don't, you have to send one. Will you give us a PIN number?

456
00:18:36,739 --> 00:18:40,319
I'm thinking what is wrong with you people? This is ridiculous.

457
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,119
-- Yeah. But for 99 out of 100 cases,
-- it's

458
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:44,650
more than that. I

459
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:45,729
-- think
-- I started doing

460
00:18:45,739 --> 00:18:47,040
one in a million man.

461
00:18:47,189 --> 00:18:51,069
I, I set the password or the pin number to like, company name sucks

462
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,739
or something along those lines.

463
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,880
And it's, it's more to just, you know,

464
00:18:56,339 --> 00:19:00,290
to, to vocalize my displeasure with them

465
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,760
than anything else.

466
00:19:01,869 --> 00:19:05,089
And, um, but yeah, it's childish and I get that, but,

467
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,800
you know, it, it's frustrating because I really do wish, for example,

468
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:12,500
they have logins to their websites.

469
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,280
Why am I logging in with like,

470
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:17,040
anything but my email address or more ideally my

471
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,469
Google account or a Facebook account or Twitter account.

472
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:19,890
Because,

473
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,979
you know, like,

474
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:24,020
again, you got like, they have these terrible password requirements.

475
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,849
It's like my bank. Right. My bank has

476
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,180
still doesn't have two factor authentication.

477
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:31,119
Who most Canadian banks don't?

478
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:34,199
I know mine doesn't either. It's ridiculous.

479
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:39,339
I mean, on the mobile app it's just like, what's your user name and password? Great.

480
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:42,890
Oh, and your user name is your like account number which is embossed on your card.

481
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,000
-- I don't
-- have that, at least

482
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:44,699
mine's just,

483
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,469
I won't say what it is.

484
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,500
The dirty secret is that numbers,

485
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:52,140
you know, if it's a debit card, that's also your like debit visa number. Right.

486
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,420
-- So again, it's really not secret.
-- No,

487
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,300
no, it's not.

488
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,329
Right. You just post a picture of that on Instagram for everyone to see. Right.

489
00:20:00,339 --> 00:20:02,010
Look everyone. I have a debit card.

490
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,119
Yes. Anyway, anyway.

491
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:06,079
Uh

492
00:20:06,869 --> 00:20:10,359
-- Right.
-- So I think the reality is this is here to stay because all these companies

493
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,439
have to have this information to,

494
00:20:12,589 --> 00:20:14,219
you know, have an efficient business.

495
00:20:14,449 --> 00:20:15,160
Ok.

496
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:15,229
I,

497
00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:17,319
I would go a step further than just saying it's

498
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:22,010
here to stay is I don't envision any drastic changes.

499
00:20:22,739 --> 00:20:27,270
Let's look at Equifax and that is probably one of the largest,

500
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,800
most dangerous leaks that has ever happened in the history of humanity.

501
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,439
The reality is, it's probably not going to affect a lot of people

502
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,920
and my guess is it will change nothing in the industry.

503
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:45,869
I think what we might see is maybe credit freezes become slightly easier to do.

504
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:47,869
And that's it. But even that, like, oh,

505
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,810
it, it's the Equifax site. Right. You can find out what any

506
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,689
credit freeze number is,

507
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,849
like three

508
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,489
public pieces of information. I mean, it's,

509
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,150
but even then, even then, all right.

510
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,729
So someone's gonna have to target you specifically,

511
00:21:02,939 --> 00:21:05,689
right? It's, it's not going to be like

512
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:08,079
-- hundreds of millions of people affected by
-- it.

513
00:21:09,209 --> 00:21:09,239
And

514
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,670
if I get enough personal information about you

515
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,010
and your credit rating is high enough,

516
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,479
I can take out a mortgage in your name and that's a lot of money.

517
00:21:15,489 --> 00:21:18,489
-- No,
-- you can't because the bank is going to come and take the house away.

518
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,369
But when they find out it's not me.

519
00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:21,349
Right?

520
00:21:21,449 --> 00:21:23,619
No, but the seller would get the money, right. And

521
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:24,930
you know,

522
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:25,530
it's

523
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:27,160
a James Bond movie plot.

524
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,750
This stuff happens

525
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:28,989
Google

526
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:29,160
it.

527
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:35,719
I, I'm sure it is conceivable but, but I don't envision that being

528
00:21:36,209 --> 00:21:38,060
an overly practical problem.

529
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:38,780
Uh

530
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,920
No, it happens quite a bit.

531
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:42,030
I

532
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:43,300
don't believe you

533
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,229
-- Google
-- it.

534
00:21:44,969 --> 00:21:45,819
I don't want to,

535
00:21:45,939 --> 00:21:47,160
I'm just gonna not believe it.

536
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:47,589
Here

537
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:48,089
we go.

538
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,890
Equifax says it has been able to flake nearly $1 billion

539
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,050
of attempted mortgage fraud among its lender clients since 2013.

540
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,839
That's an article from 2015.

541
00:21:57,589 --> 00:22:01,760
Um It's I know, mortgage fraud is a problem in Canada, in the Canadian market.

542
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:04,319
I don't know about the US market, but it's definitely a problem up

543
00:22:04,479 --> 00:22:06,729
here. Mortgage fraud. Explain this to me. Then

544
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,400
basically, it's where, you know,

545
00:22:11,989 --> 00:22:15,380
I get somebody else's information, personal identification

546
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,869
and I take out a mortgage in their name and then I pay the seller and the seller.

547
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:22,989
Uh for example, we might pay an over inflated price or something.

548
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,770
And that's how the seller makes a bit of extra money.

549
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:24,989
You know,

550
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,939
they're typically in on the fraud as well or you

551
00:22:27,949 --> 00:22:30,469
have a property that's not worth much of anything,

552
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:30,800
right?

553
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,089
And you vastly overpay for it.

554
00:22:33,609 --> 00:22:36,160
Uh or you, if you have multiple people, right?

555
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:40,199
You would actually buy from, you would buy from a legitimate seller,

556
00:22:40,209 --> 00:22:41,660
pay the legitimate seller

557
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:43,790
and then immediately turn around and flip it.

558
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,859
So that way, you know, you can siphon off the money,

559
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,250
OK? And

560
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,489
you flip and you sell it to another

561
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,530
entity that is also stolen information,

562
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:54,770
-- right? And so that that's how you extract those big piles of money.
-- But,

563
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,569
but, but

564
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:59,010
if the first couple of things, you talk about where you,

565
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,489
you essentially have a seller in

566
00:23:00,699 --> 00:23:01,150
cahoots,

567
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:06,290
somebody got the money. You can't exist in a civilized country

568
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,329
with stolen money like that

569
00:23:08,469 --> 00:23:09,729
and not be found,

570
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:11,089
-- right?
-- Well, true.

571
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:15,119
But that's, you know, you can do multiple layers of sellers and more to the point,

572
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,979
how do you prove the seller was in on this.

573
00:23:16,989 --> 00:23:19,410
-- Uh
-- That could be a problem.

574
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:23,170
But my suspicion is the bank can still go after them because in,

575
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,890
at least in the United States,

576
00:23:25,189 --> 00:23:27,560
if you have stolen goods, they're not yours.

577
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:29,829
Even if you paid for them, they, they will come and take them.

578
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:31,979
-- But he
-- doesn't have stolen goods. He has the money, he was paid.

579
00:23:34,109 --> 00:23:37,239
But here's the thing, man, if, if I'm walking down the street

580
00:23:37,469 --> 00:23:40,400
and a guy stops and says, here's a million dollars,

581
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:43,069
give me your coat and we're even right.

582
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:44,750
And I say, wow, that's neat. Thanks.

583
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,520
And then the police show up and say, hey,

584
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:48,560
that guy just stole a million dollars from the bank.

585
00:23:48,569 --> 00:23:50,780
Uh Give it back to us. I say, oh no, no,

586
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:52,430
he, he bought my coat.

587
00:23:52,689 --> 00:23:54,339
They couldn't be like no,

588
00:23:54,589 --> 00:23:56,109
give me, give me them. All right.

589
00:23:57,199 --> 00:24:01,300
So on the one hand, you, you, they, they would have to prove that it was their money

590
00:24:01,469 --> 00:24:03,479
because you could also, there's been cases,

591
00:24:03,489 --> 00:24:05,810
there's been cases where people have been flying and they

592
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,410
have a lot of money in the ts a confiscation.

593
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,500
That's different though, right? That's different.

594
00:24:10,979 --> 00:24:11,119
Well,

595
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:11,489
I'm just

596
00:24:11,609 --> 00:24:11,959
saying that

597
00:24:12,589 --> 00:24:12,790
back

598
00:24:12,949 --> 00:24:13,510
to the original

599
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:13,670
point.

600
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:14,359
Ok?

601
00:24:14,569 --> 00:24:15,780
But back to the original point,

602
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,739
there is quite a bit of mortgage fraud with stolen identity.

603
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:19,329
We add

604
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:20,270
links in the show notes.

605
00:24:20,969 --> 00:24:21,619
Um

606
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,540
and it's uh you know, and, and some of it too is also

607
00:24:26,979 --> 00:24:31,219
um, people wanting to borrow more than they're allowed to,

608
00:24:31,349 --> 00:24:34,579
you know, by, well, what their credit scores and stuff would indicate. So they may

609
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:37,880
not necessarily borrow somebody else's identity,

610
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:40,400
but they may monkey with their own stuff, you know.

611
00:24:40,589 --> 00:24:41,989
So that's not really identity fraud.

612
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,709
That's just more classic, I guess, straight up fraud.

613
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:46,239
Um,

614
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:49,439
but there was a good reddit comment pointing out that, you know,

615
00:24:49,449 --> 00:24:51,170
this stuff used to be called bank fraud.

616
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:54,579
And now they've turned it on its head to be, you know, identity theft. And

617
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,880
essentially they've turned it from being like the bank's problem to being,

618
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:58,300
you know,

619
00:24:58,439 --> 00:25:00,209
your problem, like your identity got stolen.

620
00:25:00,219 --> 00:25:02,280
Now, you're the one that has to jump through all these hoops

621
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,140
and deal with all this BS. Whereas in the past it was,

622
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,010
yeah, you know,

623
00:25:07,569 --> 00:25:09,439
um, and I think fundamentally, yeah,

624
00:25:09,449 --> 00:25:11,410
that's just not gonna change because obviously, you know,

625
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,569
companies aren't gonna take on liability unless

626
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:15,209
it's absolutely shoved down their throat.

627
00:25:15,219 --> 00:25:16,619
And, I mean, Equifax was

628
00:25:17,069 --> 00:25:21,359
weeks or even months ago trying to get rid of a whole pile of, you know,

629
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,839
if they get breached, they'll be held accountable for stuff.

630
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:29,280
Um One of the hacker news threads pointed out simply put here simple idea,

631
00:25:29,729 --> 00:25:31,160
$10 per record.

632
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:32,439
Uh, fine.

633
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:33,319
Right.

634
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,719
The government finds these people $10 per, every record popped

635
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,420
and clearly somebody like Equifax with what is 143 million.

636
00:25:40,699 --> 00:25:44,709
Right. That's, that's $1.4 billion. I don't really care how big you are.

637
00:25:44,719 --> 00:25:46,390
That, that's going to hurt nobody.

638
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:47,790
That,

639
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:48,459
yeah.

640
00:25:48,469 --> 00:25:49,209
Well,

641
00:25:49,219 --> 00:25:52,949
the tobacco industry paid tens of billions of dollars of findings still around.

642
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:53,719
But anyways,

643
00:25:53,869 --> 00:25:54,770
the point being is that,

644
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:58,270
that will force or heavily encourage companies to go get insurance and

645
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,530
that means the insurance companies will force them to comply with

646
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,390
some basic sanity,

647
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,430
you know, in order to get their policy. And

648
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:06,260
the,

649
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:08,489
the point is we basically have to add

650
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,729
some sort of economic incentive for these people

651
00:26:10,739 --> 00:26:12,010
to do the right thing because right now

652
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,430
there's no incentive like Equifax got popped.

653
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:16,010
Have they been fined yet? No,

654
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:19,829
there are class action lawsuits. Uh, there's now one in Canada

655
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:24,150
because apparently there were Canadians in UK, uh, people from the UK

656
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,000
that were definitely affected.

657
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:27,910
And, um,

658
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:31,430
you know, assuming those class action lawsuits ever happen, I mean,

659
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:32,989
those lawyers are going to make out like bandits,

660
00:26:33,209 --> 00:26:34,109
they'll make a ton

661
00:26:34,609 --> 00:26:39,510
and I might get like a rebate check for $5 off my next identity. Um, what is it?

662
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,750
What's that product they sell that they were pushing?

663
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,140
They, they remember because, oh, they hid the credit freezing thing behind like,

664
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:49,150
you know, signing up for identity theft protection service.

665
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:52,689
And then they also were sending people to a fishing site for like a week,

666
00:26:52,699 --> 00:26:53,270
weren't they?

667
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,439
Well, some guy had like,

668
00:26:55,770 --> 00:27:00,430
it was, what was it? The, the actual site? I think it was Equifax 2000 seventeen.com

669
00:27:01,089 --> 00:27:02,180
and he registered

670
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:05,439
like security Equifax 2000 seventeen.com.

671
00:27:05,689 --> 00:27:10,040
And yeah, Equifax was tweeting out and sending people to the wrong URL like

672
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,750
you literally had one job.

673
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:15,540
No, you know this. Ok.

674
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:16,689
So actually

675
00:27:16,979 --> 00:27:20,400
I'm not going to, to knack them for this because

676
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:25,000
what, what generally happens is when things are crazy like this people,

677
00:27:25,189 --> 00:27:27,880
people aren't, you're not operating

678
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:28,270
safely.

679
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:28,680
But see

680
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:29,829
right here's the,

681
00:27:30,569 --> 00:27:32,800
you should have a plan for this.

682
00:27:32,939 --> 00:27:37,430
-- They clearly didn't plan for anything. I mean, come on.
-- But it's like, it's like,

683
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,579
you know, it's like fire drills and fire safety. Right.

684
00:27:39,589 --> 00:27:42,729
That's something we as a society have gotten pretty good at. Right. People

685
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:44,920
very rarely die in fires now and, you

686
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,150
know,

687
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,099
so much so that when they do it makes the news

688
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:47,890
because,

689
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:51,000
because like 100 years ago there were tons of fire deaths

690
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,229
and finally people cared enough to do something about it.

691
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:53,599
Right.

692
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:56,089
And so my thinking is, you know,

693
00:27:56,099 --> 00:27:58,699
you should have a breach plan which

694
00:27:58,709 --> 00:28:01,060
should probably include things like having a designated

695
00:28:01,069 --> 00:28:06,000
URL like breach or security dot your company name.com for people to go to and,

696
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:09,010
you know, have something set up or ready to go.

697
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,750
That's not a wordpress instance with the, you know,

698
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:13,750
whatever. But I

699
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:14,209
mean,

700
00:28:14,349 --> 00:28:15,819
to me this is kind of,

701
00:28:16,689 --> 00:28:19,270
yeah, I get that this stuff isn't easy and it does cost money.

702
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,280
But come on, these are not mom and pop shops. This is

703
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:26,589
-- Equifax. See,
-- but it doesn't matter who it is because

704
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:31,579
nobody is ready for something like this. And, and unless you literally train for it,

705
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,420
you will not be ready and you will make mistakes,

706
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,829
right? Just period.

707
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:40,810
Yeah, I mean, ok, Equifax's gross profit in 2016 was 2.03 billion.

708
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,219
Now, granted that's gross profit.

709
00:28:43,229 --> 00:28:45,369
So there's still stuff coming off of that but still,

710
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:49,619
you know, pre-tax income of $728 million.

711
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:56,630
Uh, so here we go. Uh, the net income profit loss was $488.8 million.

712
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:57,119
Ok.

713
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,569
I'm sorry. But they,

714
00:29:00,189 --> 00:29:03,079
they definitely have the money to have prevented this.

715
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:05,939
The question isn't if they have the money to prevent it.

716
00:29:06,099 --> 00:29:07,699
That's not the question at all.

717
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:09,020
The fact is

718
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,839
they didn't do anything about it,

719
00:29:12,069 --> 00:29:12,180
but

720
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,949
I wouldn't either because there's no, there's no liability. Right.

721
00:29:14,989 --> 00:29:16,810
Except for the class action lawsuit

722
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:20,300
which will take at least five or 10 years.

723
00:29:20,349 --> 00:29:22,300
They're just going to settle those things for,

724
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,979
for pennies on the dollar of what's being asked today.

725
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:29,560
I mean. Right. That's what's gonna happen and, and they're gonna end up giving away

726
00:29:29,699 --> 00:29:31,199
some sort of trifle

727
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:32,979
as, as the reward.

728
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,530
Well, if they're really smart, they'll give away like a year of free

729
00:29:35,689 --> 00:29:36,359
identity

730
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,140
theft service,

731
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:37,349
free

732
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:39,589
upgrade to the pay one.

733
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,260
You know,

734
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:42,170
I know,

735
00:29:42,349 --> 00:29:43,020
I know

736
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,699
to their own service.

737
00:29:46,939 --> 00:29:47,170
But

738
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,030
anyway, whatever it,

739
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,729
I think the reality is this is just gonna keep happening because there's nothing,

740
00:29:53,739 --> 00:29:55,709
well, first of all, there's nothing to stop it from happening.

741
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:57,079
It's not like all these companies are suddenly

742
00:29:57,089 --> 00:29:58,930
going to magically get good at security.

743
00:29:58,939 --> 00:29:59,180
No,

744
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,010
no, they aren't.

745
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:03,770
And, and, ok, look, and there's also the, the discussion you could have,

746
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,349
even if Equifax said

747
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:08,430
here's a billion dollars, I want to fix this today.

748
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:11,170
What could they honestly do That would make a difference,

749
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:15,060
inventory all their software and figure out exactly what

750
00:30:15,069 --> 00:30:18,069
they're all running and then maybe start patching it.

751
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,060
But, but my suspicion is this, this

752
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:22,930
would that really matter.

753
00:30:24,699 --> 00:30:25,349
I don't know.

754
00:30:25,369 --> 00:30:29,130
I mean, it's, I, there's part of me thinks, like,

755
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,390
how do you actually siphon off 100 and 43 million

756
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,119
records without it being noticed and more to the point,

757
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,089
apparently it was noticed but nobody just

758
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:38,550
stopped it again. You know, that's a gross failing. I mean,

759
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:43,420
part of me thinks maybe you either. Well, I, I carrot and stick. Right.

760
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,989
Hey, if you notice a data breach, 100 grand

761
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,579
all of a sudden, I think maybe your employees are going to pay a bit more attention

762
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:52,579
maybe. Or they could cause a data breach.

763
00:30:54,099 --> 00:30:54,199
Yeah,

764
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,020
exactly.

765
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:58,170
You know, the minute you start measuring and incentivize something you're,

766
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,819
you're, you're going to get people like,

767
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,189
oh, I found more potholes,

768
00:31:02,229 --> 00:31:02,609
you know,

769
00:31:03,619 --> 00:31:03,729
never

770
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:06,630
mind the jackhammer under my desk. Right. Exactly.

771
00:31:06,849 --> 00:31:10,380
So, no, I agree. It's not, it's, it's, it's a very nontrivial problem.

772
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:11,839
Um,

773
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:15,319
I mean, legislation could potentially help but, I mean,

774
00:31:15,329 --> 00:31:18,989
writing good legislation for this would be, wow, super nontrivial.

775
00:31:19,209 --> 00:31:20,959
It's, it's probably impossible.

776
00:31:21,449 --> 00:31:25,390
Well, I was going to say with all the lobbying power and money that these guys have,

777
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:29,750
there will never be by definition good legislation like they'll make, it's look,

778
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,569
I mean, look at the tax situation in North America.

779
00:31:31,579 --> 00:31:33,160
We have turbotax and all these other guys

780
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:35,459
lobbying to keep the tax code a complete nightmare

781
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:40,359
and not allowing you to file like online directly with the government uh easily,

782
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:44,189
you know, you can do it, but it's a, it's a very non easy

783
00:31:44,339 --> 00:31:45,000
task,

784
00:31:45,449 --> 00:31:46,709
but at the same time,

785
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:50,060
uh I pay what, like 100 bucks a year for taxes.

786
00:31:50,089 --> 00:31:52,569
I, I don't care enough that I'm going to put up a fight.

787
00:31:52,729 --> 00:31:53,040
Right.

788
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:56,439
And see that's, that's the beauty of this rent seeking behavior is you make it like,

789
00:31:56,449 --> 00:31:57,599
oh, it's just 100 bucks a year.

790
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:00,979
-- What's the big deal?
-- I have bigger problems than, than my taxes.

791
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:04,160
I just drop a bunch of paperwork off at the accountant and

792
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:05,520
that's all right.

793
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,089
Yep.

794
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,069
So,

795
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,339
no, I know, man.

796
00:32:09,569 --> 00:32:12,739
Anyway, we should move on to a happy topic like like

797
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,709
Bluetooth.

798
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,229
Yeah. So,

799
00:32:16,739 --> 00:32:20,369
well, like everything. I mean, Bluetooth is networking, networking

800
00:32:20,729 --> 00:32:21,750
apps have flaws. I

801
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,189
know

802
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:23,640
it's that simple.

803
00:32:23,849 --> 00:32:27,900
Yeah. You know, I, I, I'm surprised it took this long to be perfectly honest with you,

804
00:32:28,719 --> 00:32:29,760
nobody bothered to look.

805
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,859
And, and that was actually one of the interesting findings in that report from the,

806
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:36,130
the Blue Barn where let's talk about Blue Barn for those

807
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,910
of you out there who haven't figured it out yet.

808
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:43,079
Um And, and of course, for future listeners in the year 2035 Blue Barn, look it up.

809
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,000
But anyway,

810
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:47,150
uh they did mention in the report that basically testing

811
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,709
this stuff is really hard to do because there just isn't

812
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:54,040
a lot of good hardware on the market that can kind of do

813
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:58,119
-- strange things.
-- Definition Bluetooth is terrible.

814
00:32:59,239 --> 00:33:00,819
Like, do you know how much,

815
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,280
how I like a great example.

816
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:06,979
My partner, her phone and her car and their Bluetooth connectivity at

817
00:33:07,449 --> 00:33:10,689
least once a week. She ends up swearing at it because it just doesn't want to work.

818
00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:13,869
-- You
-- know, most of the Bluetooth things I have are pretty solid now.

819
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,869
They used to be really bad, but I haven't had too much trouble lately.

820
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,160
Interesting.

821
00:33:20,829 --> 00:33:22,270
-- That's fair.
-- But uh,

822
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:26,219
no, I mean, the, the in general, you know, Bluetooth chip sets are,

823
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,770
they're really cheap.

824
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:31,170
Uh Yeah, but they're, they're also very specific as well. I mean,

825
00:33:31,339 --> 00:33:34,930
think about some of the wireless hacking, like all the Wi Fi stuff.

826
00:33:35,239 --> 00:33:38,609
There were, there were chip sets that were produced that let you

827
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,930
do some wacky stuff with the, the wireless radio

828
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,359
and it sounds like with Bluetooth, those don't exist.

829
00:33:44,369 --> 00:33:49,319
So it's really hard to abuse Bluetooth the way we, we were abusing,

830
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,599
you know, kind of wi fi some years back.

831
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:52,750
Yeah.

832
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,660
Yeah. No, it's, um,

833
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,369
you know, the reality is if it's

834
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:59,650
code, chances are it has

835
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,520
flaws

836
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,729
and chances are some of those flaws are remote code execution

837
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:04,709
-- and
-- you know what

838
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:05,250
if you

839
00:34:05,969 --> 00:34:06,219
look at it.

840
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:08,280
So a lot of these chips

841
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,530
that, that these people, like these Bluetooth chip sets, for example, are either

842
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:16,790
they're either kind of source code turned into a processors, you know,

843
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,760
they have security issues or

844
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:22,560
it's some sort of general purpose chip that's running firmware

845
00:34:22,938 --> 00:34:23,168
and

846
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:23,438
sore

847
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:24,300
radio.

848
00:34:24,478 --> 00:34:24,530
Right.

849
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,810
Exactly. Exactly.

850
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,639
And so, you know, those things are,

851
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:31,260
the chip itself has got to be just a disaster on the inside.

852
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:32,370
Yeah.

853
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,550
Yeah, it's crazy, man.

854
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,320
So,

855
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:35,938
but

856
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:39,168
the, I think the real uh problem with this too is, is

857
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:43,389
Linux as an operating system, you know, the, the Linux running on

858
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,810
computers like proper computers, desktops, servers,

859
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:50,800
those typically, you know, can get patched without too, too much hassle.

860
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:53,409
Now, that doesn't mean they do get,

861
00:34:53,728 --> 00:34:56,989
so it's at least possible for distributions to ship these

862
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,550
updates and for people to actually apply these updates,

863
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,209
you know, and not have a bricked system most likely, or

864
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:05,340
if they do manage to break it, they can recover it because it's, you know,

865
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,229
a machine in a room that they probably can physically.

866
00:35:08,419 --> 00:35:08,739
Yeah.

867
00:35:08,889 --> 00:35:10,465
And then kind of sliding the scale.

868
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:15,425
We have like the IOT where all of a sudden we have, well, I sold you this device.

869
00:35:15,435 --> 00:35:17,665
I have no real incentive to update it. So I'm not going to.

870
00:35:18,195 --> 00:35:21,354
And it literally is that simple. Now, the good news is

871
00:35:21,534 --> 00:35:26,064
the majority of IOT devices. Now, at least in my experience

872
00:35:26,304 --> 00:35:28,064
they do Wi Fi, they don't do Bluetooth,

873
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:29,840
right?

874
00:35:29,909 --> 00:35:31,659
I've seen a few that do Bluetooth,

875
00:35:31,669 --> 00:35:34,459
but the vast majority do Wi Fi for the simple reason that

876
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:36,060
that's how they hop on the internet.

877
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:38,959
So that's how you hop onto them and configure them. Right? I mean,

878
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:42,760
we're not going to add an extra 10 cents in Bluetooth chip set when we don't have to.

879
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:43,270
Right.

880
00:35:43,979 --> 00:35:45,540
That's why that adds up

881
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,520
and then

882
00:35:46,929 --> 00:35:48,800
another sort of area

883
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:53,699
cell phones. And of course, uh I think all cell phones now have Bluetooth,

884
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,620
there must be a model that doesn't, but as a, as a,

885
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:01,290
I'm gonna make a general statement that like all cell phones have a Bluetooth chip.

886
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,840
I think we can agree with that.

887
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,020
Yeah, because you know, headsets,

888
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:07,300
keyboards, mice, all that stuff.

889
00:36:08,229 --> 00:36:09,360
And, well, not only that,

890
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:14,179
a lot of these devices now you're buying like a system on a chip and it just,

891
00:36:14,189 --> 00:36:16,010
it has Bluetooth, like you don't have a choice.

892
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:16,129
In

893
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,850
fact, I heard a thing the other day that most of these Android phones,

894
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:24,219
I guess have the ability to receive like high def over the air television

895
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:27,879
because that's like a huge thing in Korea apparently. But they, they just disable

896
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,870
-- it.
-- Well, it's like the FM chip set.

897
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:30,449
Right.

898
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,149
All the,

899
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:33,560
all these cell chip set chip sets have a

900
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:36,100
built in FM radio because it's some government requirement,

901
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:36,909
I think in the US

902
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,239
for emergency services or whatever.

903
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:42,370
And of course, they all disable it because, you know, we don't, the power budget,

904
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:43,429
whatever that is

905
00:36:43,649 --> 00:36:43,659
a

906
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:44,949
FM radio.

907
00:36:45,429 --> 00:36:46,520
Yeah, anyways.

908
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,320
Um, so that's the problem though is,

909
00:36:49,449 --> 00:36:49,469
is

910
00:36:49,979 --> 00:36:50,320
ok,

911
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:53,739
thank goodness this flaw is probably not in actual silicon

912
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,330
because if it's in the actual silicon then yeah,

913
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,919
you gotta throw your phone away and buy a new one.

914
00:36:56,929 --> 00:36:58,199
So ain't nobody doing that.

915
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,600
So assuming it's in the software then again, in theory it can be passed.

916
00:37:02,729 --> 00:37:04,010
But we go back to the old

917
00:37:04,219 --> 00:37:07,409
and, you know, we've, we've gone over this topic like 50 times now that like, yeah,

918
00:37:07,419 --> 00:37:09,330
if you have like something like a Google phone or whatever,

919
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,860
you can probably get updates if you have a carrier phone.

920
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:12,840
Good luck with that.

921
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:16,219
And if you're like me in Canada, then just, you know, that's why I hate to say it.

922
00:37:16,229 --> 00:37:17,560
That's why I bought an iphone because I know

923
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:20,080
I'll get software updates for about three years.

924
00:37:20,409 --> 00:37:22,860
And you know, and somebody was pointing out that like

925
00:37:22,979 --> 00:37:26,949
something like 80% of these Android phones basically will or

926
00:37:26,959 --> 00:37:29,510
more to the point can never get an update.

927
00:37:29,629 --> 00:37:33,750
Yeah, that's going to be a problem for, I don't know, probably 3 to 5 years.

928
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,560
I think cell phones, realistically, once people have had them for five years,

929
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:37,479
they tend to chuck them.

930
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:40,310
Well, they're just gonna quit working eventually. I mean,

931
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:43,989
that, I, I can't think of a cell phone in modern

932
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:48,590
memory that, that has lasted more than probably two or three years.

933
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:52,000
My iphone three kept trucking until I chucked it.

934
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:54,429
I mean, the battery was toast on it, but

935
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,570
the electronics were fine.

936
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:00,050
And so I would actually use it when I traveled, I would have it plugged into a battery.

937
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,209
I'd go to T Mobile, get a $10 SIM card and

938
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:02,360
a

939
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:07,530
one gigabyte data plan for like 10 bucks because my carrier charges me 60 bucks for,

940
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:10,199
I think it's half a gigabyte of data in the US.

941
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:12,669
You know, it's crazy, man.

942
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,860
Yeah. And my, my, you know, having an iphone, it doesn't do dual SIM cards.

943
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,699
Um, so I would just haul around my old, uh iphone three, you know,

944
00:38:20,709 --> 00:38:25,129
pop a T Mobile sim in it, get my data plan and that's now my gps basically.

945
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:27,280
And, or, you know, finding a place to eat

946
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:28,479
that won't kill me.

947
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:34,209
Oh, hey, good news. I just found a new Korean Fried chicken place. Amazing. So,

948
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,729
and apparently this is a big, apparently, like

949
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:40,909
there's, now I've tried three places locally that are Korean that do fried chicken

950
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,250
and they are all

951
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,949
like literally some of the best fried chicken I've ever had.

952
00:38:44,959 --> 00:38:47,790
So apparently that's a thing in Canada. And I hope in the US too is that

953
00:38:47,969 --> 00:38:51,830
-- apparently Koreans have mastered fried chicken,
-- I guess I've never looked,

954
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,429
but that's in, in, how did we get to this?

955
00:38:54,439 --> 00:38:56,419
You're talking about cell phones?

956
00:38:56,979 --> 00:38:57,229
Sorry.

957
00:38:57,439 --> 00:38:58,979
Just with respect to the food,

958
00:38:59,334 --> 00:38:59,895
you know, in the

959
00:39:00,445 --> 00:39:02,284
epidemiology, not killing you. Right.

960
00:39:02,294 --> 00:39:05,534
I always look at the Yelp reviews and stuff now for these restaurants,

961
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:09,415
it's good that we make it from talking about salmonella to Korean

962
00:39:09,425 --> 00:39:13,534
Fried Chicken with a stop on identity theft and cell phone.

963
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:14,405
But uh

964
00:39:14,665 --> 00:39:15,294
but yeah, so,

965
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:18,010
yeah, I mean, these phones are never going to be updated.

966
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:21,250
Now, is somebody going to actually exploit this on a massive scale?

967
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,050
And the answer is almost certainly not.

968
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:26,489
They, they can't, you have to, the proximity is the problem. Right?

969
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:30,580
Well, and, and in certain environments like say New York City or the subway or stuff,

970
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:32,729
you could definitely pop tons of these phones.

971
00:39:32,739 --> 00:39:35,780
But then the question is ok, so you've hijacked these people's phones,

972
00:39:35,989 --> 00:39:39,290
-- kind of, how do you monetize that?
-- Well, my guess is

973
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:42,649
this won't be a, a mass market problem.

974
00:39:42,659 --> 00:39:46,209
This will be like a tailor access operation sort of thing, right?

975
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:47,409
Where you have and that's

976
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:50,929
in one organization wants to attack another organization.

977
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:55,020
And so this is one of the ways you can get inside of the wall,

978
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:55,610
right.

979
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:58,540
And the beauty is, yeah, it's, um, like, yeah,

980
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,810
it's definitely going to be used only

981
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:03,000
with like advanced persistent threat style people.

982
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:03,689
Right.

983
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:06,199
And I mean, the thing I really would

984
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:09,629
love to see is what's the feasibility of, you know, kind of

985
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:11,929
breaching air gaps by kind of,

986
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:15,290
you know, pop guy's home computer with Bluetooth, pop his cell phone,

987
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,520
have his cell phone, pop into the office, you know, and so forth.

988
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:20,040
Right. You probably don't even need that, man.

989
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:23,989
I mean, the home computer is probably logged into the office gmail, right?

990
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:24,830
I mean,

991
00:40:25,629 --> 00:40:30,760
that's, this is, this is the crazy thing I think about with bring your own device

992
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:31,449
is

993
00:40:31,979 --> 00:40:35,120
you have so little control over what's going on.

994
00:40:35,129 --> 00:40:38,389
And I guess at the same time this is the world we have to architect for.

995
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,330
And again,

996
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,679
did you really ever have that much control when you were buying these devices

997
00:40:42,209 --> 00:40:44,179
-- for these people?
-- No, you did not. And that, that's the, that's

998
00:40:44,189 --> 00:40:44,959
-- exactly
-- right.

999
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:49,340
A lot of security people will say, oh, we have to disable remote gmail access.

1000
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:50,679
That that's, that's the problem.

1001
00:40:50,979 --> 00:40:52,850
And in reality, uh number one, you can't

1002
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:57,300
because then people are just gonna like run a proxy on their work machine, right?

1003
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:59,679
That they connect into or some nonsense like that.

1004
00:40:59,689 --> 00:41:01,780
I know the government does that a lot and I actually

1005
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:04,120
kind of envy it because when these people aren't at work,

1006
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:05,179
they're not at work.

1007
00:41:05,189 --> 00:41:08,500
And, and that that is glorious. And that, that has a very,

1008
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,679
I just figured out,

1009
00:41:09,689 --> 00:41:11,300
I think that's why a couple of my

1010
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:13,939
coworkers actually have desktop computers and not laptops.

1011
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:14,879
Sure,

1012
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,840
I suspect.

1013
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:16,820
And I just realized,

1014
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:20,219
I think my next computer I get from work will be a desktop because then I'll be like,

1015
00:41:20,385 --> 00:41:22,145
yeah, no, sorry, not at home. Can't

1016
00:41:22,304 --> 00:41:22,685
see.

1017
00:41:22,695 --> 00:41:25,155
That's one thing I do try really hard to do is I keep

1018
00:41:25,165 --> 00:41:28,455
my laptop on my desk and it doesn't come off my desk.

1019
00:41:28,504 --> 00:41:32,875
If I'm doing something, I'm, I'm in here doing such stuff, but at the same time,

1020
00:41:32,885 --> 00:41:33,574
it's really nice.

1021
00:41:33,584 --> 00:41:37,455
Obviously, when I travel, I just grab it and go and, and everything's fine.

1022
00:41:37,834 --> 00:41:38,324
But,

1023
00:41:38,465 --> 00:41:40,925
well, I've also, so with my just having moved,

1024
00:41:40,935 --> 00:41:43,864
I've also basically decided to really embrace, you know,

1025
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:45,175
Google's beyond Corp thing.

1026
00:41:45,185 --> 00:41:47,334
So right now my, it infrastructure at home consists of,

1027
00:41:47,959 --> 00:41:50,729
I've got my, uh my DS L and my cable modem.

1028
00:41:50,899 --> 00:41:52,060
They both obviously do

1029
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:52,389
N A,

1030
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,959
you know, because I, everybody has more than one device. Now.

1031
00:41:54,969 --> 00:41:58,520
They both do wi fi uh reasonably, well, not great.

1032
00:41:58,919 --> 00:42:00,189
Um I will have to plug a Wi

1033
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:04,459
Fi like an actual Wi Fi router into the cable so I can get coverage in the backyard.

1034
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,340
Um And, but that's it.

1035
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,229
Everything else, the laptops, the ipads,

1036
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:10,810
they're just sitting on those networks that I, I

1037
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:15,550
have intentionally not plugged in or used my, uh like I have a PF SENSE,

1038
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,520
hardware firewall,

1039
00:42:16,689 --> 00:42:19,270
you know, running, what is it free BS D I think is what they use.

1040
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,139
Um,

1041
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:26,070
so I've intentionally gotten rid of my firewalls and I, we were,

1042
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,290
I know we were talking about this before the show and you were like, well,

1043
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:31,179
but you know what if the ISP device is hostile?

1044
00:42:31,189 --> 00:42:33,179
And the answer is, well, yes, it probably is.

1045
00:42:33,449 --> 00:42:34,110
Regardless.

1046
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:37,270
I still have that thing in my path of communication because,

1047
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:40,600
and if all you care about is the net, then it's going to do its job.

1048
00:42:40,979 --> 00:42:41,389
Right.

1049
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:45,929
Well, more to the point, almost everything in my house is mobile.

1050
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,909
So having a firewall at home is nice. But,

1051
00:42:49,419 --> 00:42:52,770
you know, when I take my phone or tablet or laptop to the coffee shop,

1052
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,159
it's on the public internet.

1053
00:42:54,169 --> 00:42:57,510
Well, or maybe not on the public internet, but it's at least within the coffee shop,

1054
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,679
it's, you know, accessible.

1055
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:02,379
Yeah. Yeah. And so more to the point I have to,

1056
00:43:03,229 --> 00:43:08,229
I have to secure all my devices as if they were properly attached to the true internet

1057
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:11,729
because that's probably what's going to happen with them.

1058
00:43:11,879 --> 00:43:13,129
Yes. Yes, it is.

1059
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:14,810
-- And you
-- know, so

1060
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:15,939
I, I think I stopped

1061
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:19,409
pretending like I, I can have a walled garden of safety.

1062
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,250
I think that's exactly the right way to look at it.

1063
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,850
There's, there's no other solution.

1064
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,070
It, it is what it is.

1065
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:27,129
Yeah.

1066
00:43:27,139 --> 00:43:30,219
Literally the only thing I can think of value for having

1067
00:43:30,229 --> 00:43:32,139
a home firewall now is if you have two internet links,

1068
00:43:32,149 --> 00:43:32,649
like me

1069
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,969
-- and you have automated fail over.
-- Sure.

1070
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,919
And, and I get that, that, that does make sense. I,

1071
00:43:38,129 --> 00:43:41,379
yeah, I've been thinking about this actually and I no longer have anything.

1072
00:43:41,389 --> 00:43:42,729
I've, I've slowly been

1073
00:43:42,929 --> 00:43:46,689
just dealing with my infrastructure and the only thing I have left

1074
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:51,209
and in my internal network that, that is we'll say not an end,

1075
00:43:51,419 --> 00:43:52,290
end client

1076
00:43:52,909 --> 00:43:53,750
and client. That

1077
00:43:53,899 --> 00:43:54,530
makes sense.

1078
00:43:54,929 --> 00:43:56,050
Uh Anyway,

1079
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:58,850
yes, that makes sense

1080
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:03,000
is I have a file server that I use for backups and like that's it.

1081
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:05,169
But even that doesn't have

1082
00:44:05,459 --> 00:44:07,979
any, nothing is open, you have to off

1083
00:44:08,129 --> 00:44:12,199
in some way to get to it. So, yeah, basically, I've reached a point where

1084
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,489
because I used to have a guest network and I thought I was thinking this last night is

1085
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:19,064
I can turn my guest network off. I have no reason to keep this on anymore.

1086
00:44:19,074 --> 00:44:21,034
And it's just a pain in my neck because

1087
00:44:21,205 --> 00:44:25,745
actually one of the things I found is if I have two devices that want to see each other,

1088
00:44:25,754 --> 00:44:29,114
like to play Minecraft or something and one is on the guest network and one isn't,

1089
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:31,215
it's like, oh crap, you're on the wrong network.

1090
00:44:31,225 --> 00:44:32,185
Like switch that.

1091
00:44:32,899 --> 00:44:33,149
Yeah.

1092
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:37,399
No, my uh like, yeah, my wifi used to be like, oh super secure password, blah, blah,

1093
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:37,760
blah.

1094
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:42,510
Yeah, I'm probably gonna basically set it up so that the password is like, password

1095
00:44:42,699 --> 00:44:44,719
or, you know, something along those lines where it's,

1096
00:44:45,179 --> 00:44:47,689
yeah, exactly. You know, like my home address or whatever.

1097
00:44:47,939 --> 00:44:49,570
Who cares,

1098
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:53,209
who cares? Like, that's, that's the moral of the story.

1099
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:53,780
Yeah.

1100
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:54,080
Well,

1101
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:58,889
I remember a few months ago we were at a nice Mexican restaurant in Cold Lake and, uh,

1102
00:44:59,629 --> 00:45:01,439
they had Wi Fi but no free Wi Fi.

1103
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:03,939
And so my partner being smart,

1104
00:45:03,949 --> 00:45:07,239
she hopped on the restaurant named Wi Fi and

1105
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:09,239
tried the restaurant name with the password and it worked

1106
00:45:10,169 --> 00:45:10,629
well done.

1107
00:45:10,709 --> 00:45:11,929
And, and my thinking there is like,

1108
00:45:11,939 --> 00:45:16,590
why bother even having a password at that point if it's the name of the wire, like,

1109
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,969
if it's the name of the restaurant, right?

1110
00:45:17,979 --> 00:45:20,050
Like, it's clearly, that's quite guessable.

1111
00:45:21,189 --> 00:45:24,860
Who knows? Because somebody told them open Wi Fi is bad.

1112
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:25,979
I mean,

1113
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,320
but, I mean, that's it. Right.

1114
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:31,669
I mean, this whole beyond Corp thing I think makes sense because quite frankly the

1115
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:35,989
everything is going to end up on the internet

1116
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,189
at some point whether you want it or not because

1117
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:39,989
almost everything is mobile now. Right.

1118
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,860
So, yeah, let's stop pretending. I mean,

1119
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,459
but, yeah, you know,

1120
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,139
uh,

1121
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,110
I know all these government offices that have,

1122
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,939
like Wi Fi locked down and they have their networks locked down and blah, blah, blah,

1123
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:55,020
but they issue everybody laptops and it's not like they're physically

1124
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:58,239
like they're locked to the desk with those little Kensington locks.

1125
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:01,100
But obviously the people can unlock them and move them to the break room or whatever.

1126
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:03,649
So obviously they can move them to like Starbucks

1127
00:46:04,459 --> 00:46:05,550
or whatever.

1128
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:06,939
You gotta love it.

1129
00:46:07,459 --> 00:46:09,709
Oh, well, anyway, anyway, I think

1130
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:11,909
going back to the bring your own device thing,

1131
00:46:11,919 --> 00:46:13,729
I think this is actually a positive thing is,

1132
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,199
you know, for example, the cloud security alliance, right?

1133
00:46:17,209 --> 00:46:19,120
Our our technology requirement for you.

1134
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:21,120
If you work for the cloud Secure Alliance is simple,

1135
00:46:21,129 --> 00:46:24,239
you have to have a device that can uh receive S MS messages.

1136
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,879
Uh So that indicates some sort of cell phone typically

1137
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:28,050
uh

1138
00:46:28,229 --> 00:46:30,750
which I think everybody has at this point.

1139
00:46:31,209 --> 00:46:35,760
Um You must also have a device that can run um

1140
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:37,399
Google authenticator.

1141
00:46:37,729 --> 00:46:40,120
So the authentication app, so it's an Android or an iphone

1142
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,280
-- device,
-- you can use a U two F key man.

1143
00:46:43,219 --> 00:46:46,120
Uh Well, that's uh also supported, but um

1144
00:46:46,399 --> 00:46:49,540
essentially you have to have a device that can at least run

1145
00:46:49,959 --> 00:46:51,159
mobile phone apps

1146
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:55,679
and it can be a phone or, you know, it could be an ipad, I don't care, right?

1147
00:46:57,050 --> 00:46:57,959
And then that's it,

1148
00:46:58,580 --> 00:46:59,939
that's the technology requirement.

1149
00:46:59,949 --> 00:47:02,750
Then we basically are like, you probably want to also have like a computer,

1150
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,919
like a laptop or something

1151
00:47:04,419 --> 00:47:06,899
and like it has to be able to run a web browser,

1152
00:47:06,909 --> 00:47:10,570
which basically means like anything in the last 15 years is probably OK.

1153
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:12,760
You know, and that's it, right.

1154
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:18,000
That's, that is our policy uh technology policy, right? Everything is in the cloud.

1155
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:18,370
So

1156
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:22,229
you basically have to have, yeah, we, we actually do use UTF KEYS.

1157
00:47:22,709 --> 00:47:23,330
Um,

1158
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:26,280
you know, but they're, they're kind of a chore in getting them to remote people.

1159
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:28,570
And also, you know, those, some of those factors

1160
00:47:28,709 --> 00:47:29,110
get it from

1161
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:29,260
a

1162
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,129
man and they're good to go.

1163
00:47:31,689 --> 00:47:31,899
Yeah.

1164
00:47:31,909 --> 00:47:34,209
Well, it's just, I actually, no, I'm not going to,

1165
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:37,639
I tell them to buy an expensive because why, why am I gonna, you know?

1166
00:47:38,699 --> 00:47:41,560
Yeah, I, I'm not a logistics center.

1167
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,000
That's what Amazon is for.

1168
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,750
Like, that's literally what Amazon is for.

1169
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:50,060
I could update my address with them. I want my packages.

1170
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:50,830
Um

1171
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:53,419
But yeah, so sorry just I,

1172
00:47:53,429 --> 00:47:55,300
I have to update my address with so many

1173
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:57,129
people and it's so pointless because really the only

1174
00:47:57,139 --> 00:47:59,129
people that matters are the people who give me

1175
00:47:59,139 --> 00:48:00,500
internet because they need to know where I live.

1176
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:01,520
So they know where to put, you know,

1177
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:04,479
put the wires and Amazon because they have my packages.

1178
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:05,360
It's true

1179
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:08,110
and I guess Canada Post because they also have my packages.

1180
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:09,530
Um

1181
00:48:10,149 --> 00:48:10,939
But yeah, so,

1182
00:48:11,169 --> 00:48:12,570
you know, that's the thing right is,

1183
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:17,340
is we have literally no it policy other than you must be able to receive S MS messages

1184
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:20,679
and you must be able to like run mobile apps

1185
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,100
because we kind of assume being that it's like

1186
00:48:24,449 --> 00:48:26,159
past the year 2010.

1187
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:26,500
But

1188
00:48:26,739 --> 00:48:29,209
you can figure out how to get a computer that can go on the way.

1189
00:48:29,229 --> 00:48:34,419
-- You think
-- so, except there's lots of organizations that are stuck in 2005

1190
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:36,260
and, and don't do any of those things.

1191
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:38,139
I

1192
00:48:38,929 --> 00:48:39,189
too bad

1193
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:41,419
-- for them.
-- It is, it is, it is,

1194
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:44,139
the world is changing at a dramatic pace

1195
00:48:44,389 --> 00:48:47,219
and we are not keeping up at all.

1196
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:50,610
Well, it's funny too because the, the technology to do this.

1197
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:53,179
So a great example, everybody's like, oh, if you bring your own device,

1198
00:48:53,189 --> 00:48:55,649
what happens if these people copy all the data off, blah, blah, blah?

1199
00:48:55,659 --> 00:48:56,929
Well, yeah, that can happen. But

1200
00:48:57,179 --> 00:48:58,750
you know, you can do things like Citrix,

1201
00:48:58,949 --> 00:49:00,330
right? The the desktop

1202
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:01,610
stuff where,

1203
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,429
you know, you, you log into a Citrix app and you essentially,

1204
00:49:04,439 --> 00:49:05,850
it's like a remote desktop thing

1205
00:49:06,429 --> 00:49:09,250
and you know, you can't visit, like you can't cut and paste,

1206
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:12,399
you can't copy files off so you can screenshot for sure.

1207
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,020
But

1208
00:49:13,179 --> 00:49:18,010
like come on, like to get a ton of data out via screenshots, you know, that's,

1209
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:20,409
that's gonna be an onerous process.

1210
00:49:20,419 --> 00:49:23,800
Well, and not only that, like this is something I think about a lot is

1211
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:25,010
how much,

1212
00:49:25,179 --> 00:49:26,689
what are you doing?

1213
00:49:27,169 --> 00:49:31,959
That is so sensitive that if it does escape, it's going to ruin your business.

1214
00:49:32,389 --> 00:49:36,649
I bet most organizations literally don't have something that if it leaked,

1215
00:49:36,659 --> 00:49:37,959
could ruin their business.

1216
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:42,310
I I would agree the vast majority yet, quite honestly,

1217
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:46,899
very few companies have amazing patent pending technology or, you know,

1218
00:49:46,909 --> 00:49:47,969
pharmaceutical data.

1219
00:49:47,979 --> 00:49:51,250
That's like super sensitive and quite frankly, most organizations,

1220
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:54,229
even if you gave this data to them, they couldn't execute on it,

1221
00:49:54,429 --> 00:49:54,959
right? Like,

1222
00:49:55,199 --> 00:50:00,030
like a great example is ebay. They were not the first auction site by all means,

1223
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:03,399
but they executed quite a bit better because I

1224
00:50:03,409 --> 00:50:05,209
remember using some of those other auction sites and,

1225
00:50:05,219 --> 00:50:07,629
oh my Lord, they were painful

1226
00:50:07,899 --> 00:50:10,560
and ebay made it, you know, about 10% less painful.

1227
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:14,479
Yeah. And, uh, they won, you know, just like Amazon, right. I remember

1228
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:17,679
Amazon. It was like, yeah, I can buy stuff from them. But this is like stupid.

1229
00:50:17,689 --> 00:50:18,870
Why would I buy stuff from them?

1230
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:20,699
I can go to the store

1231
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:21,899
and not wait.

1232
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:24,290
And then of course, now I buy everything.

1233
00:50:24,439 --> 00:50:27,719
I had that conversation with my wife yesterday. We were driving home

1234
00:50:28,189 --> 00:50:30,360
from, uh, we, we were at her parents' place

1235
00:50:30,879 --> 00:50:31,500
and

1236
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:35,459
we talk, we were talking about old stores because Toys R Us is declaring bankruptcy.

1237
00:50:35,469 --> 00:50:37,100
-- And like when I was a kid and Toys R Us
-- was,

1238
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:39,179
-- it's official now because I heard they were thinking about
-- it.

1239
00:50:39,189 --> 00:50:41,770
I'm pretty sure they announced it officially last week.

1240
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,500
But it was like, when I was a kid it was a huge deal. Right. And,

1241
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:47,300
and we're talking about that, you know,

1242
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,780
I remember getting the Sears catalog

1243
00:50:49,989 --> 00:50:54,489
was a thing, right? It was like this enormous phone book sized catalog of stuff.

1244
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:57,750
And as a little kid it was like, look at how many things there are here.

1245
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:58,689
This is amazing.

1246
00:50:59,219 --> 00:50:59,750
And,

1247
00:51:00,149 --> 00:51:05,219
and you figure these stores back in, in the early nineties probably said Amazon,

1248
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:06,530
you know, online ordering.

1249
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:09,729
Who wants that crap? Right. Nobody wants that.

1250
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:10,770
And now you feel

1251
00:51:10,959 --> 00:51:12,379
-- like they're all gone.
-- And

1252
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:14,500
the funny thing is that's how Sears started

1253
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:17,179
the whole point of their catalog business was to

1254
00:51:17,189 --> 00:51:19,379
utilize excess freight capacity on the rail line.

1255
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:20,580
Exactly.

1256
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:22,919
And, and then I think brick and mortar

1257
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:25,379
thing and, and people often forget.

1258
00:51:25,629 --> 00:51:28,320
And here's the thing too is this is the nature of disruption

1259
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:30,979
and this is kind of the way security is as well is

1260
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:34,290
there are things happening that are going to drastically change

1261
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,959
our industries and if everyone knew what it was,

1262
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:38,300
it wouldn't be disruptive.

1263
00:51:38,709 --> 00:51:39,080
Right.

1264
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:40,320
True.

1265
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:41,850
Some of it though, like for example,

1266
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:44,250
bring your own device that will clearly happen because quite

1267
00:51:44,419 --> 00:51:44,600
frankly,

1268
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:45,629
well,

1269
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:46,770
yes and no,

1270
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:50,879
it's here but a lot of companies refuse to support it or pretend it doesn't exist.

1271
00:51:51,169 --> 00:51:52,830
Don't keep working for that company.

1272
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,179
You need,

1273
00:51:53,189 --> 00:51:55,010
you need to find a new job because your company

1274
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,820
is probably not going to be around in 10 years

1275
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:00,189
because here's the thing right, right now, like a phone,

1276
00:52:00,209 --> 00:52:03,459
a phone is a hugely personal device, right?

1277
00:52:03,469 --> 00:52:07,439
Like my whole life is on that phone, that phone knows what my home is, it knows,

1278
00:52:07,719 --> 00:52:08,949
you know, it literally,

1279
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:12,010
I get phone calls and it's like this is probably so and so because I basically

1280
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:15,870
strip mind all your email and found this phone number in a random signature line.

1281
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:18,939
So it's probably this person. I'm like, cool. That's actually correct.

1282
00:52:18,949 --> 00:52:19,669
Thank you for that.

1283
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:21,550
You think that is a personal device?

1284
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,909
Think about augmented reality,

1285
00:52:22,919 --> 00:52:25,030
like a pair of glasses and some other things that

1286
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,070
you use to interact with reality on an ongoing basis.

1287
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:28,909
Right.

1288
00:52:29,649 --> 00:52:30,169
That's

1289
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:30,479
like

1290
00:52:30,659 --> 00:52:31,340
underwear.

1291
00:52:31,449 --> 00:52:32,830
-- That's something you
-- cover this.

1292
00:52:34,379 --> 00:52:35,929
Yeah. Actually they did. Yeah.

1293
00:52:35,939 --> 00:52:38,850
Well, again, in the show, well, actually I think they covered this a few times,

1294
00:52:39,479 --> 00:52:41,429
actually. Yeah, that's true. Augmented reality.

1295
00:52:41,439 --> 00:52:44,139
I'm thinking of the one with the Facebook,

1296
00:52:44,149 --> 00:52:46,870
like app where people give each other scores.

1297
00:52:46,879 --> 00:52:47,110
Um,

1298
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,110
I rock bottom. I think it's called

1299
00:52:49,469 --> 00:52:49,939
Yeah.

1300
00:52:50,689 --> 00:52:55,159
-- Yes. Rock Bottom. We'll put links in the, I guess, links to Netflix,
-- uh, whatever.

1301
00:52:55,169 --> 00:52:58,189
Just, yeah, if you're listening to this, you don't know what Black Mirror is.

1302
00:52:58,199 --> 00:53:01,739
Shame on. You go find it and list it. Right. Like pirate it if you have to.

1303
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:02,260
It's worth it.

1304
00:53:02,669 --> 00:53:03,330
I didn't say that

1305
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:03,979
anyway.

1306
00:53:04,989 --> 00:53:08,379
Uh, right. And I think there's one more thing we should talk about before we go.

1307
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:12,060
And that is, uh, uh, Poor Trevor, the cockroach at Derby Con.

1308
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:15,080
Yeah. So, what's the deal with this? I,

1309
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:19,000
it's completely silly and in fact I didn't go to Derry.

1310
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:19,320
Derry

1311
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:20,699
comes on a weekend and I,

1312
00:53:20,709 --> 00:53:24,709
I have a hard time getting away on the weekend actually just due to family stuff.

1313
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:25,250
And

1314
00:53:25,469 --> 00:53:26,570
so apparently

1315
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:27,419
some,

1316
00:53:27,429 --> 00:53:32,379
somebody found a cockroach in their milkshake apparently at this hamburger joint,

1317
00:53:32,389 --> 00:53:34,489
one of the, one of the derby con attendees

1318
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,379
and they put a picture of the cockroach on the internet,

1319
00:53:37,389 --> 00:53:38,939
but the cockroach is completely dry.

1320
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:41,050
So my suspicion is it didn't come out of a milkshake

1321
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:44,129
because I can imagine what a milkshake cockroach would look like.

1322
00:53:44,139 --> 00:53:44,889
And it's not that,

1323
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:45,399
but

1324
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:48,610
-- I
-- imagine you wouldn't find it because it would have been

1325
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:51,739
-- or
-- you would have just drank it. I mean, let's face it. Right.

1326
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:54,810
Oh, that's a piece of strawberry. Right.

1327
00:53:55,419 --> 00:53:56,750
Anyway, anyway,

1328
00:53:56,929 --> 00:53:59,340
yes, I want a milkshake now. But anyway, uh

1329
00:53:59,709 --> 00:54:02,729
and so in, in true hacker fashion, you know, posted on Twitter,

1330
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:04,449
everyone's retweeting it and ha and this

1331
00:54:04,459 --> 00:54:06,560
funny and then apparently the restaurant like,

1332
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:08,010
started flipping out and it's giving all these

1333
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:09,929
statements and interviews and stuff about how,

1334
00:54:09,939 --> 00:54:13,550
how clean, how clean they are, which whenever, like if you, if you have a restaurant,

1335
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,330
like you have cockroaches, just end of story.

1336
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:17,989
Right? I don't care who you are or where you are. Like, that's just life.

1337
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:19,010
Right.

1338
00:54:20,169 --> 00:54:23,330
-- Just hopefully they're well behaved and they stay off the counter.
-- Right. Exactly.

1339
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:25,129
Yeah. Stay under it. Right. Cockroaches.

1340
00:54:25,139 --> 00:54:27,810
And if you listening, you're going to stay under the cabinets, right?

1341
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:28,449
That's where it's

1342
00:54:29,219 --> 00:54:32,530
when the lights go out, then you're fine. But until then anyway,

1343
00:54:32,699 --> 00:54:33,250
and then,

1344
00:54:33,919 --> 00:54:35,620
and then apparently people, uh

1345
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:40,590
you started a vigil at the restaurant and there's a picture on the link I put in the,

1346
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,340
in the notes

1347
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:46,280
where it shows like someone has a bottle of Colt 45 out and, and just all this,

1348
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:50,050
this silly stuff for the obviously untimely death of Trevor the cockroach.

1349
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:50,830
So it was,

1350
00:54:50,959 --> 00:54:51,649
I'm sad.

1351
00:54:51,659 --> 00:54:55,169
I miss Derby Con for this event only like all the

1352
00:54:55,179 --> 00:54:57,120
other stuff is on youtube and I can watch it.

1353
00:54:57,199 --> 00:54:59,469
But I'm sad. I missed this.

1354
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:01,580
Yeah, I've added a link to the show.

1355
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:05,780
We had a similar thing for a dead raccoon in Toronto a few years back.

1356
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:11,260
Yeah, they, they built a memorial around them while the city,

1357
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:15,729
I guess. Well, even better yet. Ok. So somewhat related topic.

1358
00:55:15,889 --> 00:55:20,010
Uh, somebody basically found like, what they thought was kind of a big house cat,

1359
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:21,810
sort of chilling out on a piece of grass.

1360
00:55:22,679 --> 00:55:24,540
Uh, so they call animal control, right?

1361
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:27,570
Because, you know, big house cat loose should be picked up.

1362
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:31,010
Turns out it's like a bobcat and the animal control lady of course is like, yeah.

1363
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:33,790
No, I do like dogs and cats. I don't do bobcats.

1364
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,860
That's, you know, you better call fish and wildlife, you know, fish cops.

1365
00:55:37,639 --> 00:55:42,010
So she, and she just bails and what gets me though, these people are like,

1366
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:44,300
posting pictures and they're like, oh, I kept my distance from it.

1367
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:46,580
I was like, 3 m away from it, like 10 ft and I'm like

1368
00:55:47,439 --> 00:55:51,100
a house cat 10 ft away from, you will be on your face.

1369
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:53,419
Like by the time you halfway blink and

1370
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:53,850
jump and

1371
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:54,040
a

1372
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:54,719
cat,

1373
00:55:56,439 --> 00:55:59,189
like a bobcat will be like eating your face

1374
00:55:59,629 --> 00:56:00,459
in less time than it takes.

1375
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,320
That's like, you know what I always think of in this is there was, there was some,

1376
00:56:04,719 --> 00:56:08,780
some guy, he was like a documentary filmer or something and decided to live

1377
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:12,449
with the bears and they, they literally ate him.

1378
00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:14,830
-- Yeah,
-- there's apparently a sound recording of it.

1379
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:19,020
That's what I heard. And it's, I just, I always think about stuff like that. And

1380
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:19,419
what

1381
00:56:20,389 --> 00:56:20,449
do you

1382
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:23,320
-- play stupid games? Win stupid prizes?
-- I guess.

1383
00:56:24,229 --> 00:56:25,330
It's just like,

1384
00:56:26,199 --> 00:56:28,040
what do you expect to happen? Right.

1385
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:32,189
If you go live with the bears, they're almost certainly going to eat you.

1386
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:35,570
They're saying a 1% chance the bear will eat you today. Right.

1387
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:38,810
Someday your 1% is going to come up.

1388
00:56:39,659 --> 00:56:42,129
Oh, sorry. It wasn't a bobcat. It was a lynx.

1389
00:56:42,409 --> 00:56:45,419
And if you've ever seen a lynx, you know, that's not a house cat.

1390
00:56:45,649 --> 00:56:48,469
-- Yeah. I don't know if I've ever, you really
-- should know that.

1391
00:56:48,629 --> 00:56:50,290
I, I feel like, sure.

1392
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:51,010
Uh,

1393
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:51,929
but anyway,

1394
00:56:52,169 --> 00:56:54,489
they're like, 30 pounds

1395
00:56:54,590 --> 00:56:55,909
-- and they have, like,
-- that is

1396
00:56:56,139 --> 00:56:56,989
wacky ears.

1397
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,050
It is not a house cat.

1398
00:56:58,679 --> 00:56:59,280
No.

1399
00:56:59,899 --> 00:57:03,189
Um, but yeah, so, and this comes back to security and that

1400
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:06,459
we've made life safe enough that most people don't know.

1401
00:57:06,469 --> 00:57:09,719
Like a great example here is the tourists and the wild animals and they, like,

1402
00:57:09,729 --> 00:57:11,620
go and feed deer and stuff and like,

1403
00:57:12,229 --> 00:57:12,610
yeah,

1404
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:16,510
anybody that knows what a deer is knows you don't do that because deers are vicious,

1405
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,760
vicious bitey kicky animals.

1406
00:57:18,989 --> 00:57:19,409
Yes,

1407
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:20,300
I've been chasing

1408
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:20,850
deer.

1409
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:21,570
It's like geese,

1410
00:57:22,290 --> 00:57:22,879
geese. Are,

1411
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:23,409
they

1412
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:24,729
use them as guard animals

1413
00:57:25,139 --> 00:57:25,219
in,

1414
00:57:25,379 --> 00:57:27,409
did you know? So, so get this.

1415
00:57:27,419 --> 00:57:30,899
I remember going to London some years back and there were Canadian geese there.

1416
00:57:30,909 --> 00:57:33,649
And I thought, why are there Canadian geese in London? Right.

1417
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:34,850
I, I looked into this

1418
00:57:35,459 --> 00:57:38,639
and it turns out one of the kings thought the geese were neat

1419
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:42,000
and they imported yeast and obviously

1420
00:57:42,189 --> 00:57:44,590
they're a total menace now and everybody hates them.

1421
00:57:44,729 --> 00:57:49,239
But it's like, why would you bring those things willingly to your continent?

1422
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:53,719
-- I
-- mean, they make good eating. I'll say that they are tasty. They're so horrible.

1423
00:57:53,729 --> 00:57:55,479
They're like the worst creatures ever.

1424
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:59,679
-- They are incredibly aggressive.
-- I hate the geese.

1425
00:57:59,689 --> 00:58:04,080
And, well, I ride my bike a lot by a river where there are geese all the time.

1426
00:58:04,229 --> 00:58:07,729
And, oh, my goodness. I get chased by geese so much. It's not.

1427
00:58:07,899 --> 00:58:10,209
And I always think like the problem is they're big enough.

1428
00:58:10,219 --> 00:58:11,649
If I ever hit one on my bike,

1429
00:58:11,659 --> 00:58:14,209
I'd probably fall off and then his friends would attack me.

1430
00:58:14,389 --> 00:58:15,750
So I tried really hard.

1431
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:17,209
Right. Right.

1432
00:58:17,969 --> 00:58:19,820
All right. It's time to call it.

1433
00:58:20,139 --> 00:58:22,260
So I guess parting words,

1434
00:58:22,429 --> 00:58:24,550
-- if
-- it's bigger than a house cat, give it some

1435
00:58:24,659 --> 00:58:24,899
room.

1436
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,560
That's good advice.

1437
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:30,669
All right. So anyway, thank you. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.
