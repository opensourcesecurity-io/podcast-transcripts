Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:11,229
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:15,840
-- So
-- I have a strange story to tell as part of this opening. And

3
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,270
it is, I guess a very typical story

4
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,079
with respect to the way I tend to

5
00:00:22,569 --> 00:00:27,989
do new things. We say I built an antenna over the weekend, a, an aluminum antenna.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,069
So when you say antenna, you mean,

7
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:31,610
like just a piece of wire that sticks up straight or something?

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,240
A little more fancy,

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,689
it's a little more fancy.

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,580
-- So this one does have some wood on it.
-- I wasn't that impressed initially.

11
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:38,009
Right.

12
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,549
Right. Of course. So

13
00:00:39,919 --> 00:00:41,250
given my,

14
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:44,130
I guess more free time than usual I have at the moment I

15
00:00:44,139 --> 00:00:49,430
decided I want to download weather satellite data with a software defined radio,

16
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:51,340
which I had a software defined radio

17
00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:54,500
and I played with it for a little while and then I threw it in the closet.

18
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:58,259
I didn't touch it and I took it back out and I started my journey.

19
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:02,599
The first step of this was I needed something to pick up a satellite and

20
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,410
I found instructions on the internet to build an antenna out of old coat hangers.

21
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:11,069
And, and the thing is too, I didn't want to spend a bunch of money on something.

22
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,750
I didn't know if I'd even want to do.

23
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,230
So, I build my antenna

24
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:17,610
and, yeah, it's literally coat hangers and it works well enough. Right.

25
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,190
I could pick up some of the NOAH satellite I could get, I mean,

26
00:01:20,199 --> 00:01:23,699
I think I sent you a picture on, on slacker signal or something.

27
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,040
I forget which, but anyway, I,

28
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,110
I could see the pictures and they were good enough and it was amusing to me and then

29
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,099
I started doing research and there are Russian

30
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,970
satellites also that send weather data to earth.

31
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,807
But they are, we say a little more complicated and harder to pick up.

32
00:01:38,818 --> 00:01:40,807
-- And so I try picking them up my coat hanger
-- satellite.

33
00:01:40,818 --> 00:01:43,407
Is that like an intentional thing or they just have like a weaker signal?

34
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:47,648
No, it's a better signal. It's, it's a digital signal versus an analog signal.

35
00:01:47,657 --> 00:01:49,538
So obviously you need a better antenna to

36
00:01:49,547 --> 00:01:51,608
just pick it up because obviously with analog,

37
00:01:51,617 --> 00:01:53,907
like if I drop a bunch of data, whatever, I don't care, it's

38
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:55,487
-- a
-- smear bit in the image.

39
00:01:55,538 --> 00:01:56,347
Yeah. Right. Right.

40
00:01:56,358 --> 00:01:59,718
And so I went and bought aluminum rods and I built

41
00:01:59,727 --> 00:02:03,047
like a nice antenna that looks good and it's still granted,

42
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:05,405
like we're talking less intense dollars and parts here.

43
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:09,065
Right. I had a bunch of material in the house, I had a bunch of the cabling.

44
00:02:09,076 --> 00:02:14,345
I needed, I just needed two aluminum rods. I put it together and surprising nobody.

45
00:02:14,356 --> 00:02:16,985
An antenna not made of coat hangers is about 10

46
00:02:16,996 --> 00:02:19,975
times better than the antenna made of coat hangers.

47
00:02:19,985 --> 00:02:21,406
-- This is
-- something that gets me is like the stuff

48
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,496
that used to be literally rocket science is now like,

49
00:02:23,505 --> 00:02:25,186
available at Home Depot for five bucks.

50
00:02:25,195 --> 00:02:26,865
Seriously. Right. Right. But

51
00:02:27,035 --> 00:02:28,886
so anyway, I'm, I'm working on this.

52
00:02:28,895 --> 00:02:31,815
I still haven't decoded any images off the Russian satellites, but I,

53
00:02:31,826 --> 00:02:33,065
at least I'm seeing a signal.

54
00:02:33,143 --> 00:02:36,203
I know I'm going in the right direction right now. But now

55
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,123
the next logical step in this

56
00:02:38,264 --> 00:02:40,994
is now I'm looking for satellite dishes to buy,

57
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:42,914
why not?

58
00:02:43,294 --> 00:02:44,593
And I just keep thinking it's,

59
00:02:44,694 --> 00:02:48,154
I feel like I'm going to end up as one of those freaks with like 30 satellite

60
00:02:48,164 --> 00:02:51,483
dishes and 12 antenna on the top of their house by the time I'm done with it.

61
00:02:51,544 --> 00:02:53,363
Well, if the satellite thing doesn't work out for you,

62
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,283
you can turn them into giant death rays.

63
00:02:55,453 --> 00:02:55,753
Right.

64
00:02:56,414 --> 00:02:57,483
And cook chickens in them.

65
00:02:57,503 --> 00:02:59,373
I always feel like this is something I do

66
00:02:59,384 --> 00:03:01,673
or I just like start falling down this rabbit hole

67
00:03:01,962 --> 00:03:05,451
and then it's like sunk cost fallacy. Well, I've already gone this far.

68
00:03:05,462 --> 00:03:07,481
I might as well buy a satellite dish

69
00:03:07,492 --> 00:03:10,981
now to pick up geostationary weather satellites.

70
00:03:10,992 --> 00:03:13,082
I'm curious how big a satellite dish do you actually need

71
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:16,162
-- for this
-- basically like a direct TV size satellite dish.

72
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:16,182
Oh,

73
00:03:16,192 --> 00:03:18,031
because I was going to say I literally have one on the side of

74
00:03:18,042 --> 00:03:20,621
my house that I need to get a tall enough ladder to take off.

75
00:03:20,632 --> 00:03:23,542
It probably cost you 10 times in shipping to get that to me.

76
00:03:23,552 --> 00:03:24,501
-- No, I'm not
-- going to send it to you.

77
00:03:24,511 --> 00:03:27,352
But I'm saying you drive around your neighborhood and find somebody

78
00:03:27,361 --> 00:03:29,401
with one that's cut off and ask for it nicely.

79
00:03:29,472 --> 00:03:31,009
That's exactly what I'm planning and

80
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,940
it is like,

81
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,630
and there's different kind. You can imagine.

82
00:03:34,649 --> 00:03:38,279
This is a completely ridiculous space where there

83
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:40,039
is an amazing amount of things to do.

84
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,000
Like a great example is when I get bored,

85
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:44,029
when I'm waiting for satellites to fly overhead,

86
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:46,759
I'll jump over to the air traffic channels and

87
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,039
I'll listen to airplanes because I don't know,

88
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,449
-- like, I don't even know what's going on, but
-- I did do some binge listening of like,

89
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,039
at TC incidents and some of them are just comical.

90
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,488
Oh, ac you know, the assessment just taxied under us. Can you maybe let them know?

91
00:04:00,498 --> 00:04:02,658
I haven't heard anything completely ridiculous.

92
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:07,617
But I, yeah, I believe that without question. It amuses me and it's fun

93
00:04:07,837 --> 00:04:08,557
and

94
00:04:08,867 --> 00:04:12,138
I've got some free time so I'll start building

95
00:04:12,268 --> 00:04:13,537
antennas, I guess.

96
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:15,828
But anyway, anyway, this is,

97
00:04:15,977 --> 00:04:19,798
I'm sure I'll work this into the topic of the day. But what are we talking about today?

98
00:04:19,808 --> 00:04:21,197
-- Kurt? Well, it's
-- related.

99
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:25,257
So last week there was a big DNS kerfuffle, they made an exception.

100
00:04:25,268 --> 00:04:28,007
But when you were querying these root level name servers and stuff,

101
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,175
it would just keep trying, like, like,

102
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:35,096
just an absurd amount of times instead of having like a, a reasonable kind of like,

103
00:04:35,105 --> 00:04:36,555
ok, it's dead, Jim give up.

104
00:04:36,566 --> 00:04:38,355
They basically removed the exception.

105
00:04:38,365 --> 00:04:41,385
It's one of those classic security flaws where it's like, oh, that was a, you know,

106
00:04:41,395 --> 00:04:42,835
why didn't you guys get rid of that sooner?

107
00:04:42,846 --> 00:04:47,425
-- Right.
-- Right. And so functionally you could send a special request to a DNS.

108
00:04:47,436 --> 00:04:48,835
You sent a normal request,

109
00:04:48,846 --> 00:04:51,476
but then you had a whole bunch of unreachable

110
00:04:51,485 --> 00:04:53,795
DNS records set up that it would cycle through.

111
00:04:53,805 --> 00:04:57,503
It was because the root name servers were treated special by, well,

112
00:04:57,514 --> 00:04:58,813
specifically by bind.

113
00:04:58,824 --> 00:05:01,664
-- I'm sure other DNS servers do it.
-- I think power DNS and a few other.

114
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:03,984
And again, it comes back to that reliability thing of like,

115
00:05:03,993 --> 00:05:06,864
and part of me understands this because if you can't reach the root name servers,

116
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:07,033
well,

117
00:05:07,044 --> 00:05:08,993
then it's broken and it's not like throwing an

118
00:05:09,003 --> 00:05:10,574
error is going to help because it's just dead.

119
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:13,334
So you might as well keep trying and back in the day. That made sense.

120
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:16,373
I think that's the launching point to this discussion

121
00:05:16,384 --> 00:05:19,933
is if you look at the historical way,

122
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,914
basically anything on the internet works,

123
00:05:21,924 --> 00:05:25,704
there was the old mantra of be very strict with what you send

124
00:05:25,713 --> 00:05:29,701
and very generous with what you accept that sort of made sense.

125
00:05:29,712 --> 00:05:31,272
A long time ago where, for example,

126
00:05:31,282 --> 00:05:35,231
you could send a sort of broken DNS query to a server and it might

127
00:05:35,242 --> 00:05:38,641
send you a correct response back because the server might be able to guess.

128
00:05:38,652 --> 00:05:41,701
Oh, I think they're doing this. So I'm going to give them a response back.

129
00:05:41,712 --> 00:05:43,152
And this was true of web servers.

130
00:05:43,161 --> 00:05:46,381
You can send a lot of trash to a web server and it's going to give you a response,

131
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:47,231
which is pretty cool.

132
00:05:47,242 --> 00:05:48,312
Even html,

133
00:05:48,321 --> 00:05:50,992
web browsers were built like this where you can send a web

134
00:05:51,002 --> 00:05:54,791
browser some seriously garbage html and it will render it into some

135
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:55,920
most of the time.

136
00:05:55,929 --> 00:05:56,170
Oh Yeah,

137
00:05:56,179 --> 00:05:58,160
like how many of us have been reading a web page and there's like

138
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,559
a bunch of garbled text in the middle and then it just keeps trucking.

139
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:05,929
-- Yeah,
-- because web servers are dumb and web browsers are frightening.

140
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,410
Well, and people make typos in their,

141
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,799
-- their html and
-- humans should not be writing html anymore.

142
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,170
But

143
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:15,489
the point is this was the historical view

144
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,329
-- of how everything should work.
-- I would say it was historically correct.

145
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:24,588
-- Except now
-- it's different. Now. The fact is if you have a client

146
00:06:24,757 --> 00:06:27,187
sending a broken DNS request,

147
00:06:27,738 --> 00:06:30,518
there's nothing wrong with just saying this is ridiculous.

148
00:06:30,528 --> 00:06:34,808
Go away versus saying, well, I'm going to do my best to service this request.

149
00:06:34,817 --> 00:06:36,988
This goes back to a bunch of our other discussions on, you know,

150
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,377
do you kind of punish people for not upgrading?

151
00:06:39,388 --> 00:06:41,898
Do you punish them for running old broken stuff?

152
00:06:41,907 --> 00:06:45,798
-- You know, like those Android phones that cannot do TLS 1.3
-- we need to punish them.

153
00:06:45,808 --> 00:06:47,088
It's not a fine line though.

154
00:06:47,097 --> 00:06:51,028
Not anymore because in the vast majority of these cases, you could argue, oh,

155
00:06:51,037 --> 00:06:52,428
someone might have an Android phone.

156
00:06:52,506 --> 00:06:58,485
I can't do this, but the reality is 99.9% of these requests are malicious.

157
00:06:58,496 --> 00:07:03,466
They're not honest users with old gear and there are some that fall into that bucket.

158
00:07:03,476 --> 00:07:04,955
But this is like the same thing, Kurt,

159
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:08,696
like a great example is I bought 100 year old house and I

160
00:07:08,705 --> 00:07:10,955
had knob and tube wired in this house when I bought it,

161
00:07:10,966 --> 00:07:14,865
which I did not know a knob and tube is ridiculously unsafe,

162
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:16,165
-- isn't it pretty much
-- exposed

163
00:07:16,175 --> 00:07:18,605
conductors in inside the walls?

164
00:07:18,615 --> 00:07:19,075
Yes.

165
00:07:19,466 --> 00:07:22,783
And if like if my insurance company knew it was there, they would have been like,

166
00:07:22,794 --> 00:07:23,683
you can't buy this.

167
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,063
You know, we're not insuring this house.

168
00:07:25,234 --> 00:07:27,803
And literally as soon as I found it, I called an electrician, I said,

169
00:07:27,813 --> 00:07:30,894
get it out now like I want it, I want this whole house rewired.

170
00:07:30,903 --> 00:07:35,053
I don't care, replace everything. But the point is you could make the argument.

171
00:07:35,063 --> 00:07:38,704
Oh, but the na and tube was good enough and no, that is completely invalid.

172
00:07:38,713 --> 00:07:42,903
And I think this holds true of a lot of this old gear, like it is the same story.

173
00:07:42,914 --> 00:07:44,834
My one concern is not so much the old gear

174
00:07:44,843 --> 00:07:47,194
but the cheap gear being used in developing countries,

175
00:07:47,204 --> 00:07:48,463
you can make that argument.

176
00:07:48,473 --> 00:07:48,903
But again,

177
00:07:48,914 --> 00:07:51,881
like is it ok to use subpar wiring in their houses that

178
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:54,282
are going to burn down a bunch of them and kill people?

179
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:57,131
No, we wouldn't make that argument at all. Why is this different?

180
00:07:57,141 --> 00:07:58,721
Well, the reality is no offense.

181
00:07:58,731 --> 00:08:01,992
But how often do people actually attack a man in the middle TLS?

182
00:08:02,002 --> 00:08:04,842
1.1 and 1.2 connections compared to just like breaking

183
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,731
into the web server and taking over it?

184
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:10,002
-- I mean,
-- in the case of TLS, obviously, it's fairly low.

185
00:08:10,182 --> 00:08:10,641
But,

186
00:08:10,742 --> 00:08:12,101
and again, this is,

187
00:08:12,111 --> 00:08:14,691
this is an instance where if you're an organization that

188
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:17,221
wants to service a place that maybe has this problem,

189
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:18,721
you can stand up old stuff.

190
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:19,500
Yeah, I'm saying like,

191
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:23,059
let's think in the context of building some sort of application

192
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:27,299
on the internet that's receiving something from somebody don't be generous,

193
00:08:27,309 --> 00:08:31,059
be very strict and say if this is malformed, too bad, go away.

194
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,750
Well, and I think for me it's more of a two step thing.

195
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,140
It's, it's,

196
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:36,558
it's not so much that I want to punish people for having old gear out of support gear.

197
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,320
It's I want to encourage them to buy stuff from vendors

198
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,929
-- that actually support it properly
-- and that's very reasonable as well.

199
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,020
-- I think, yeah,
-- chromebooks are a great example.

200
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:48,307
They have, you know, from the moment a chromebook drops, it gets six years updates.

201
00:08:48,317 --> 00:08:50,197
And so I made the mistake of buying a chromebook that

202
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,557
had actually been out for like one or 1.5 years.

203
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:54,437
So I'm only going to get 4, 4.5 years out of it.

204
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:57,078
-- But on the flip side it was like a $300 device.
-- which

205
00:08:57,187 --> 00:08:58,737
yeah, they're really cheap. Usually

206
00:08:58,857 --> 00:08:59,117
you

207
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,437
amortize that over four or five years, you know you're doing ok.

208
00:09:02,447 --> 00:09:05,578
-- I installed Linux on my chromebook. Did I tell you that?
-- Like raw,

209
00:09:06,018 --> 00:09:09,237
-- you mean like in the container or?
-- No? No, no funny story.

210
00:09:09,247 --> 00:09:11,997
My, my chromebook, there's two versions of it

211
00:09:12,237 --> 00:09:16,478
and the version I own was supposed to go end of life earlier this year

212
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:21,070
and I managed to sort of put the newer version of chrome on Chromo

213
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:26,450
s onto it through a variety of strange steps. But as part of this, I unlocked it

214
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:27,570
and I installed Linux

215
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,969
to an SD card in it. And yeah, it's running Arch Linux

216
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,440
now.

217
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:34,010
-- It's surprisingly usable actually
-- from the SD card, not the internal media,

218
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:34,390
right?

219
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,440
And I can still do Chromos and the internal media.

220
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,090
So I'm like, this is a win, win as far as I'm concerned.

221
00:09:40,099 --> 00:09:41,890
Well, and the thing is like in past, I would be like, oh my

222
00:09:41,992 --> 00:09:42,021
an

223
00:09:42,151 --> 00:09:43,231
SD card, you can't do that.

224
00:09:43,242 --> 00:09:46,452
But nowadays SD cards are like a, they're cheap, who cares if they die?

225
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:49,182
-- And b, they generally are pretty reliable and fast
-- now.

226
00:09:49,192 --> 00:09:51,692
It's noticeably slower than the internal stuff.

227
00:09:51,702 --> 00:09:54,721
But I don't care, like, it's, it's running a full Linux distribution.

228
00:09:54,731 --> 00:09:56,331
I can do all kinds of wacky stuff on it.

229
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:59,372
And actually, so part of my SDR work I'm using this as my, like,

230
00:09:59,382 --> 00:10:00,872
beater laptop in the field.

231
00:10:00,882 --> 00:10:04,492
Yeah. If I drop, like, if a horse steps on the chromebook, I don't care.

232
00:10:04,502 --> 00:10:07,091
Not that I've been anywhere near a horse recently but you know what I mean?

233
00:10:07,234 --> 00:10:08,554
I thought you were doing this in your yard and

234
00:10:08,693 --> 00:10:10,674
-- I currently
-- am. But I,

235
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:11,914
I also think about, oh,

236
00:10:11,924 --> 00:10:13,833
if I drove up here I could get a better

237
00:10:13,843 --> 00:10:16,023
view of the space station or whatever and it's like,

238
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:18,754
it's, again, it's going to get out of hand.

239
00:10:18,763 --> 00:10:22,624
I have no doubt that at some point I'm going to have like a satellite

240
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:25,443
-- dish mounted to the top of my car
-- and I was going to say,

241
00:10:25,453 --> 00:10:28,213
-- yeah, with the gimbal tracking, it's
-- going, it's going to happen.

242
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,914
Like I'm not, I

243
00:10:29,184 --> 00:10:30,814
wouldn't pretend it won't

244
00:10:31,193 --> 00:10:32,364
back to the DNS thing. I love

245
00:10:32,476 --> 00:10:34,255
this because honestly, this is one of those,

246
00:10:34,265 --> 00:10:36,245
this is actually one of those good DNS bugs where you

247
00:10:36,255 --> 00:10:38,926
don't have to actually do anything other than update your software.

248
00:10:38,935 --> 00:10:39,065
Right?

249
00:10:39,075 --> 00:10:39,166
Like,

250
00:10:39,176 --> 00:10:40,666
it's not like you have to go dirt around

251
00:10:40,676 --> 00:10:43,806
-- with conf figs or whatever
-- and it affects servers.

252
00:10:43,835 --> 00:10:46,656
-- It doesn't affect people, which is nice.
-- Yeah.

253
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,695
And, and realistically it's a denial of service attack.

254
00:10:49,705 --> 00:10:52,286
Which the thing I love about denial of service attack is two things.

255
00:10:52,296 --> 00:10:53,366
One by definition,

256
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,195
they're easy to notice because if you don't notice them

257
00:10:55,205 --> 00:10:57,575
then your infrastructure is hard enough that it doesn't matter.

258
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:02,349
And number two, they go away. Right. Because it has to be an ongoing active attack.

259
00:11:02,359 --> 00:11:03,580
It's not like I broke into your web server,

260
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:06,369
stole your data and I'm gone for a denial of service to work.

261
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,770
I have to keep pounding away and eventually people get bored and go away,

262
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,489
Jin. Yeah, that's true.

263
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:17,190
Most, most denial of service attack I think age out versus get stopped.

264
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,809
And what happens is either, well, you've got three real options.

265
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,994
Number one, they like, pay the guy to go, which hopefully people aren't doing.

266
00:11:23,005 --> 00:11:27,224
Number two, they just eat the attack and they're out of service or number three,

267
00:11:27,234 --> 00:11:28,924
they do something to their infrastructure to fix it.

268
00:11:28,934 --> 00:11:31,294
Like they get behind cloud flare and cloud flare sucks up a

269
00:11:31,304 --> 00:11:34,075
couple of 100 gigabits per second of denial of service for,

270
00:11:34,085 --> 00:11:35,164
you know, your 20 bucks a month.

271
00:11:35,174 --> 00:11:35,844
That's right.

272
00:11:35,854 --> 00:11:38,955
So, yeah, I mean, it's, and, and for myself and most people I know, you know,

273
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,635
we don't actually host our own DNS servers anymore because

274
00:11:41,794 --> 00:11:44,364
again, to do that correctly, you really, you need at least two

275
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:47,520
instances that are kind of separated network wise because, you know,

276
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,299
you remember back in the day, I think it was like Yahoo or, oh, it was Amazon.

277
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:52,090
Remember, I think it was Amazon had, you know,

278
00:11:52,099 --> 00:11:54,989
their two DNS servers but behind a single internet connection.

279
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,849
And some guy denied the service that internet

280
00:11:56,859 --> 00:11:58,280
connection and took the whole thing off line.

281
00:11:58,289 --> 00:11:58,500
And,

282
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:02,609
you know, ideally you want like at least six servers globally spread out, blah,

283
00:12:02,619 --> 00:12:06,460
blah, blah, like, man, no, you, you can just pay somebody or, well,

284
00:12:06,469 --> 00:12:08,059
places like cloud player will do it for free.

285
00:12:08,755 --> 00:12:09,594
Yeah, exactly.

286
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:15,234
I, I haven't run a DNA server in a long time and I don't miss it even a little. No.

287
00:12:15,284 --> 00:12:19,784
No, it's, yeah, I remember editing those files by hand and upgrade. You know,

288
00:12:19,945 --> 00:12:22,034
-- they
-- were so absurd too.

289
00:12:23,205 --> 00:12:26,065
You know, the thing I always forgot to do is you have to increment

290
00:12:26,395 --> 00:12:26,455
serial

291
00:12:26,844 --> 00:12:27,005
number.

292
00:12:27,135 --> 00:12:28,224
He never did that

293
00:12:28,405 --> 00:12:31,395
and every time, every time,

294
00:12:31,729 --> 00:12:33,969
whatever, whatever I don't care. Ok.

295
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,640
So, you know, it's funny because it's all this kerfuffle.

296
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:40,190
But what really gets me is, it's, there's a lot of these weird old exceptions,

297
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,140
that kind of made sense 20 years ago, but really don't anymore.

298
00:12:43,369 --> 00:12:46,750
And it goes back to your analogy of like driving a horse and buggy on the interstate,

299
00:12:46,859 --> 00:12:53,900
-- like, no, you just can't do that. I
-- think this is one of the unique failings of it.

300
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:57,229
-- We hate change.
-- Well, it's not even just hating change.

301
00:12:57,239 --> 00:13:00,919
Like there's this strange obsession with keeping certain things alive forever.

302
00:13:00,929 --> 00:13:01,880
Instead of just saying,

303
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:03,479
you know what guys like

304
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,210
it's, it's time, you know, it's load up old smokey in the trailer.

305
00:13:08,219 --> 00:13:09,559
He's going to the glue factory.

306
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:13,400
Like I don't, I don't, I don't get it all the time and although I shouldn't say that,

307
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:13,570
well,

308
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,309
part of it is keeping old stuff running because there

309
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,520
are a lot of people using really old stuff.

310
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,169
But in this case,

311
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:21,830
this is like a reliability related issue that again has just not been in, it's,

312
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,309
it's not a thing anymore.

313
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,840
I mean, there's some of that to a degree, but I even,

314
00:13:25,849 --> 00:13:27,520
-- we
-- clearly didn't need that exception.

315
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,409
I, I agree. Right. Right.

316
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:36,010
Or one of my favorite examples is there was some, this was an open SSL bug

317
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,400
-- way more specific
-- than that. Yeah, I know. I know. But I'll try to dig this up.

318
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:42,450
We might, I think we might have talked about this a long time ago.

319
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,690
There was a cipher that literally was broken

320
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,330
where if you actually tried to use it, it, it just,

321
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,169
it wouldn't even compile because no one was enabling it.

322
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:51,210
Obviously

323
00:13:51,409 --> 00:13:53,580
that's an instance where take this out. Right.

324
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:57,250
No one's using it because it can't compile because the codes literally bad. They fix

325
00:13:57,359 --> 00:14:00,809
a bug instead of just taking it out and it's like holy crap guys.

326
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,190
That is not the right thing to do in this instance. Just take it out.

327
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,659
It's obvious it was broken for like, 10 years or something. It was ridiculous.

328
00:14:07,669 --> 00:14:11,630
If it's broken and nobody could use it, why would you fix it?

329
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,099
-- Like,
-- because our way is to support things forever.

330
00:14:16,109 --> 00:14:19,919
-- Instead of saying this is stupid. Let's get rid of it.
-- See, I've got a rule now.

331
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:25,020
Like, where if I pack a box and then I move more than twice and don't unpack the box,

332
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,849
I probably don't need that box.

333
00:14:26,969 --> 00:14:28,630
I agree with that 100%.

334
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,739
And I did that. Actually, I had some boxes of stuff that

335
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:35,849
I got rid of and I didn't look at them because I knew if I opened it, I'd say, oh,

336
00:14:35,859 --> 00:14:37,109
but I want to keep this.

337
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:38,390
No, I don't need it.

338
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,650
-- And
-- I did a little bit of that because

339
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:42,549
there's a few kind of historical things in there.

340
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:45,469
But yeah, I got rid of like 80% of what was in those boxes.

341
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:50,219
The moral of the story is, don't be afraid to throw out old things.

342
00:14:50,229 --> 00:14:54,299
You're going to make someone mad. But you know what? Too bad.

343
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:56,390
That's just the way it is. Quit using

344
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:01,190
-- 11 and IE six. That's,
-- well, I would say quit using IE, right. Like we're supposed

345
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,760
to use

346
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:05,030
Edge or whatever it's called. Now, the, or what's the one they're doing?

347
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:06,599
That's chrome based edge.

348
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:11,760
Well, edge was based on something else and now it's based on Chromium as the back end.

349
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:15,520
-- It's still called edge,
-- I think trident was their parts or that was their engine.

350
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:19,450
Ok. But yeah, yeah, edge is now using chromium on the back end.

351
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,000
-- You wanted to talk about web sockets also.
-- So it's kind of an interesting thing.

352
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:26,080
So web sockets allow your web browser to

353
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:29,570
it will make a connection out to something and ask for data

354
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:34,570
and it doesn't necessarily have to be like http or http.

355
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,260
And so it's kind of useful because contrived example,

356
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,090
you could go connect to like a weather

357
00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:41,539
end point that serves weather

358
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,719
-- data.
-- I have a great example actually

359
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,250
a real example.

360
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,169
So

361
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,250
I have a Raspberry Pi

362
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,169
that

363
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,169
has a an old school B BS running on it that I can put in my bag, you can,

364
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:55,650
you can connect to it and

365
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:58,539
when you connect to it, the captive portal pops up on your screen

366
00:15:59,039 --> 00:15:59,609
and

367
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:04,640
guess what's in? It is a little terminal, you click connect it SSH is into

368
00:16:05,469 --> 00:16:06,700
the B BS, right?

369
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,469
And how is that happening all in the web browser? Well, that's a web socket.

370
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,500
That's basically it's literally running SSH in your web browser.

371
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:16,780
It's a cool technology and I like it.

372
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,500
And some of the browsers have decent security policies wrapped around it.

373
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,460
Like they won't allow web sockets to connect out to

374
00:16:21,469 --> 00:16:23,820
10 dot star or you know the other reserve networks,

375
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,299
which is good because otherwise

376
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:29,039
attacker could put you on a web page that scans your network from the inside.

377
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:31,010
Yeah, that's right. That used to be an attack. Yeah.

378
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,570
And then they put those restrictions on

379
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,299
what's interesting though is apparently they don't

380
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:36,750
restrict web socket access to local host.

381
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,270
Which, yeah, I would have thought they do because I let me put it this way.

382
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,309
I can understand why you'd want to do that sometimes.

383
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:45,809
But I think the default should be not to allow that when my web browser is like,

384
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,989
do you want to give this website access to your camera?

385
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,710
I'm like nine times out of 10 unless it's squad caster. I'm like, no, thank you.

386
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,909
-- No, the answer is always no.
-- Do you want to allow this website to

387
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,570
you? Notifications? And I'm like, God, no. Does anybody ever click? Yes on that.

388
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:58,880
Yeah.

389
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,840
-- Old
-- people do an accident and then they,

390
00:17:00,849 --> 00:17:03,440
they call me and they say my computer is full of viruses.

391
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,800
Josh come help me and I go and I'm like,

392
00:17:05,848 --> 00:17:07,790
I don't even know where this is coming from and it turns out, oh,

393
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,390
it's the web browser and it's some dodgy website

394
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,930
-- you clicked allow accidentally
-- back to web talk.

395
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:13,608
It's been scanning loo.

396
00:17:13,848 --> 00:17:18,858
So apparently there's a bunch of security packages that banks and whatnot buy that.

397
00:17:18,868 --> 00:17:20,420
They run like a kind of quasi

398
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:21,949
antivirus. And I say quasi

399
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,520
antivirus because it's labeled as antivirus, but it's like usually

400
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,810
flaming garbage because they want to check the security of your browser

401
00:17:27,858 --> 00:17:31,180
and cut down on their kind of fraud and hassle rate by,

402
00:17:31,189 --> 00:17:33,719
you know, oh, you're running a really out of date web browser.

403
00:17:33,729 --> 00:17:36,069
We're just not gonna let you do online banking or in this case, apparently,

404
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:37,040
if you connect to ebay,

405
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,770
you get a chunk of javascript that does a local host

406
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,079
port scan for a bunch of common ports like VNC.

407
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:45,819
You know, like the remote network viewing stuff. RDP.

408
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,079
I'm assuming they have a statistical model that says, you know,

409
00:17:48,089 --> 00:17:50,979
if this machine has remote control software on it, then it's probably hacked

410
00:17:51,229 --> 00:17:54,130
and somebody's probably like using that poor schlubs email or

411
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:58,579
ebay account to, you know, buy stuff and cause all sorts of problems for us,

412
00:17:58,589 --> 00:18:01,780
which fair, you know, I get those statistical models but it begs the question of,

413
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,050
you know, informed consent.

414
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,900
-- Yeah,
-- I, I agree. Ok, I'm going to break this up into a couple of pieces and I think

415
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,239
the most important piece is that, I think we can all basically agree.

416
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,119
Web browsers shouldn't just let sites do this.

417
00:18:14,349 --> 00:18:15,479
-- I would agree with that.
-- Yes.

418
00:18:15,589 --> 00:18:20,099
Now we got here probably because no one was really doing it.

419
00:18:20,109 --> 00:18:21,939
And so no one really thought it was a problem.

420
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,739
And now we know,

421
00:18:23,849 --> 00:18:25,920
so now it's time to change that behavior.

422
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:29,709
But I'm, I'm ok with saying, yeah, you didn't really know this before.

423
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:34,109
So we'll let it go but fix it, fix it now because this is ridiculous.

424
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:36,790
I'm ok with websites doing this if

425
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,150
there is informed consent.

426
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,310
And I'm,

427
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:40,010
I've been thinking about it whether or not

428
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,300
they're allowed to do this without informed consent.

429
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,520
And I think

430
00:18:43,709 --> 00:18:45,439
the answer is

431
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:49,670
no, because if you look at well, using the US as an example, you've got your, um,

432
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,150
what is it?

433
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,560
Computer fraud and abuse Act,

434
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,349
which you know, that

435
00:18:53,459 --> 00:18:53,650
class

436
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,199
where, OK, the good news is we've apparently,

437
00:18:56,209 --> 00:18:59,500
was it last year or the year before determined that terms of service on a website

438
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:02,599
are not essentially legally enforceable in the sense

439
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:04,800
of my website says doing this is illegal.

440
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,359
And if you do this now you've committed a crime. It's still a civil matter.

441
00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:10,949
Well, it comes back to that whole contract meeting of minds.

442
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:12,949
Ebay says you can't go to ebay without letting

443
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:14,660
us do this really weird thing to your computer.

444
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,910
Well, do I, can I really offer informed or willing consent?

445
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:22,369
I guarantee that phone book of a terms of service, ebay made you click. I agree.

446
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:22,959
And you didn't

447
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,689
-- probably covers this in there somewhere
-- on the flip side.

448
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:27,810
Here's what it boils down to.

449
00:19:27,819 --> 00:19:32,810
Does ebay port scanning localist actually result in any harm.

450
00:19:32,819 --> 00:19:34,290
-- I mean,
-- so ebay doing it.

451
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:34,729
No,

452
00:19:34,739 --> 00:19:36,770
but there are other sites that could definitely

453
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,099
-- do some damage
-- with that answer in mind.

454
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:42,890
I think it boils down to is we really need the web browsers to add this as a, you know,

455
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,209
sort of a security policy thing.

456
00:19:44,219 --> 00:19:47,670
Like, you know, this website wants to connect to locals. Do you want to allow it?

457
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,770
Yes or no. Right.

458
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,569
-- With a default of, no,
-- I haven't done enough research into like, what, what

459
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,099
-- can he can't do it this? But I have a great
-- example.

460
00:19:55,109 --> 00:19:57,000
You can do, it's a website, you can do anything

461
00:19:57,109 --> 00:19:58,479
and you can send any data.

462
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,040
And what's interesting is apparently Firefox also

463
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,349
restricts access to ports 21 22 23.

464
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:06,420
-- So that's Telnet FDP and SSH, that's
-- fair.

465
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:11,280
But like a great example is there's tons of software. I've run that.

466
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:14,180
Their kind of default security model is we only bind to

467
00:20:14,189 --> 00:20:16,760
local host until you set up a bunch of security stuff.

468
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,839
And then we'll let you bind to the internet. But

469
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,170
yeah, so it's bound to local host. But if a web socket can

470
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,780
into it and do

471
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:25,040
like your me

472
00:20:25,189 --> 00:20:25,219
cash

473
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:27,829
-- or whatever. Right.
-- Right now, I've got a problem.

474
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:28,949
Well, and legitimately,

475
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:33,589
there are things that you can and do run on local hosts that don't have any security.

476
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:33,869
Like Mem

477
00:20:33,989 --> 00:20:36,910
Cash D is my favorite example when I'm doing Python scripting and you know,

478
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,069
mangling a whole pile of data, I'll often use a locally running mem

479
00:20:40,189 --> 00:20:40,219
Cash

480
00:20:40,329 --> 00:20:41,949
D as a key value store. Exactly.

481
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:45,189
Because number one, that means I can very easily thread my code

482
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,670
and run it in parallel

483
00:20:46,849 --> 00:20:48,349
and just, you know, have this magic mem

484
00:20:48,469 --> 00:20:50,989
Cash D back in that just it can handle more connections than

485
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:51,790
I can throw.

486
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,839
It's magic.

487
00:20:52,849 --> 00:20:53,420
But yeah, I mean,

488
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,489
if a web socket were to connect to it and kind of it could slurp all that data.

489
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,239
-- For
-- example,

490
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:01,020
I have a strong suspicion this is not going to be dangerous in

491
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:05,520
the context of kind of a wide net attack of the internet.

492
00:21:05,969 --> 00:21:09,280
But if you are the target of an organization,

493
00:21:09,449 --> 00:21:11,709
this would be extremely valuable.

494
00:21:12,069 --> 00:21:13,829
I don't want to say for sure you can do

495
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,660
anything you want because I'm pretty sure you can,

496
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,400
but I haven't done the research myself.

497
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,599
-- Let's
-- say it's a Windows desktop,

498
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,400
right? That's a reasonable assumption.

499
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:25,430
There is stuff running down to local host. But at some point we have a security flaw.

500
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,199
I bet lots of Windows desktops have crap security for like

501
00:21:29,209 --> 00:21:33,250
the internal network accessing a shared file drive thing or whatever.

502
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:33,729
Yeah.

503
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:34,500
Well, I, I mean,

504
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:37,770
I'm talking about like Windows services that are bound to local host.

505
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,770
I don't have a machine handy to nets that on. But there SMB.

506
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,750
Yeah. And so, you know,

507
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,890
yeah, at some point this, this could be used as a, as a vector to get.

508
00:21:48,219 --> 00:21:50,339
Well, I mean, past the firewall in the net,

509
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:51,010
right?

510
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:51,739
So

511
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:55,489
I think the web browsers really do need to fix this and put on some decent policy.

512
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,329
I bet they do. Well, it's really easy. We already have a framework for it.

513
00:21:58,339 --> 00:22:00,619
We've already trained users to click yes on everything.

514
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,829
So, you know, nothing's going to break and if it does break,

515
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:05,500
they can easily fix it by changing, you know, going into the config.

516
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:08,800
And oh, I do want to allow this website to connect to my web socket,

517
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:09,819
local host or whatever.

518
00:22:09,849 --> 00:22:14,739
I, I bet they fix it. Web browsers are pretty good about being proactive in this way.

519
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,189
Whereas I think there are

520
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:20,349
actually, I have a funny related story.

521
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:23,430
I will tell that that is starting to become known and

522
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,939
this is a good time to whinge about this. Anyway, this is not well known,

523
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:32,469
but you can create a spreadsheet file and it can be a CS V file,

524
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:33,869
it can be like a legitimate

525
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,800
Excel file, it can be a Liber office file, whatever

526
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:42,579
that runs a command as something in a shell or in one of the field, the cells,

527
00:22:42,589 --> 00:22:43,459
not shell cell,

528
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,189
right.

529
00:22:44,439 --> 00:22:47,979
And this is literally functionality built into the spreadsheets.

530
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:49,069
And

531
00:22:49,819 --> 00:22:52,479
-- so obviously lots of applications
-- spreadsheet per

532
00:22:52,489 --> 00:22:54,560
se but into the spreadsheet application.

533
00:22:55,489 --> 00:22:56,280
Yeah. Right.

534
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:56,939
Right.

535
00:22:57,219 --> 00:22:57,709
And

536
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:01,410
so obviously lots of things export CS V for example,

537
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,239
that you can then import into a spreadsheet.

538
00:23:03,469 --> 00:23:03,750
Well,

539
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,229
you can export a CS V that basically runs a

540
00:23:06,239 --> 00:23:09,520
command on the system and then you can export it into

541
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,569
your spreadsheet application.

542
00:23:11,579 --> 00:23:14,630
And now the fix they had was to put a pop up up that says,

543
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,060
oh this is going to do something crazy.

544
00:23:16,069 --> 00:23:16,829
Do you want to let it.

545
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:18,150
And of course everyone clicks.

546
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,150
-- Yes, because that's what
-- people, I'm literally going to,

547
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,170
you just put equals CMD and then you put your command.

548
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,449
Basically, it's ridiculous.

549
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,209
And the thing is, and this is coming up because

550
00:23:28,489 --> 00:23:33,449
people are starting to blame the applications exporting CSV as having bugs,

551
00:23:33,459 --> 00:23:34,400
not the spreadsheet.

552
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:37,790
And I feel like a crazy person standing on the top of a mountain yelling

553
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,920
like this is a spreadsheet problem.

554
00:23:39,939 --> 00:23:44,250
This is not the problem of the thing creating the CSV because I mean,

555
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,410
fundamentally I could export a CS V,

556
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,800
I could modify it and then I could send it to you

557
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:50,650
and you're going to open it and be like holy crap.

558
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:54,390
-- What just happened? This is,
-- but the thing is this isn't like some binary data.

559
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,589
This is just valid.

560
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,560
That's a freaking CS V file.

561
00:23:57,739 --> 00:24:00,890
It's just an arbitrary text string. So here's a contrived example.

562
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,209
But what if I want to have a CSV file with an example of all the commands you can run

563
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,410
that are dangerous.

564
00:24:05,589 --> 00:24:06,650
What do you, what do you mean?

565
00:24:06,699 --> 00:24:09,469
So let's say I want to actually have a spreadsheet to document all this.

566
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:10,869
And I want to put in the spreadsheet

567
00:24:11,069 --> 00:24:13,449
all the equals command blah blah, blah stuff.

568
00:24:13,709 --> 00:24:16,510
-- I can't without the damn thing opening it up and actually doing them.
-- Oh

569
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:19,900
Right. Yeah, exactly. Well, you can escape it but right.

570
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,160
-- Functionally,
-- yes, you're right.

571
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:25,640
But I mean, again, why is the why is

572
00:24:26,109 --> 00:24:29,650
not being like, hey, you just opened the spreadsheet. It wants to run this command.

573
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,849
Click. Yes, to allow.

574
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:34,550
Well, it does that now. It didn't used to, but it shouldn't do that at all.

575
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,410
It should say like, hey, this thing's full of like crazy garbage.

576
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:41,359
If, if you need to run these insane commands, go to this setting.

577
00:24:41,369 --> 00:24:45,510
-- We've buried in this obscure place and click it.
-- Yeah, I could see that because

578
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:49,050
I'm guessing people do use this, especially in batch processing, you know,

579
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:52,109
like banks doing batch processing where a mainframe spits out a file,

580
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:53,699
something picks it up by FTP A

581
00:24:53,949 --> 00:24:55,810
windows machine grabs it which cool.

582
00:24:55,819 --> 00:24:56,770
But again, like you said,

583
00:24:56,859 --> 00:25:00,030
you can have a setting where you can say like look enable this behavior,

584
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,489
turn it on by default or prompt by default or disable it by default.

585
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,829
Here's how I'm going to use this to tie up everything we've talked about today

586
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:08,660
where

587
00:25:08,989 --> 00:25:12,489
this is almost definitely an obscure corner case

588
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:18,839
and you are damaging your whole ecosystem by allowing one obscure

589
00:25:18,849 --> 00:25:22,329
corner case to exist now that it's coming to attention.

590
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:26,880
Instead of saying this is an obscure corner case, we should do something about it.

591
00:25:27,069 --> 00:25:28,069
We're saying

592
00:25:28,229 --> 00:25:29,880
the people creating

593
00:25:29,989 --> 00:25:36,869
the files I'm going to read are the ones who are wrong. Not me. That's bananas.

594
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,800
It's worse than that because it's not only an obscure corner case,

595
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,550
it's an obscure corner case that is dangerous

596
00:25:41,739 --> 00:25:43,369
and enabled by default.

597
00:25:43,569 --> 00:25:44,500
Yeah. Right.

598
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:48,140
Like if they had that corner case and it was disabled by default but still available,

599
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,410
I would say like, oh, that's dangerous.

600
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:53,329
I agree with that, but at least it's off by default. Like thank goodness for that.

601
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:57,530
But like this is crazy that it's enabled by default and just runs by default.

602
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:01,660
And the worst part though is I'm dealing with legitimately

603
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:05,650
intelligent people that are saying this isn't a spreadsheet problem.

604
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,239
And I just, I feel like ripping my hair out with my hands.

605
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,280
-- It's not
-- a spreadsheet problem. It's a spreadsheet parser problem.

606
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:15,000
-- It is a spreadsheet problem, dude.
-- All my Python code doesn't care about this.

607
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:19,920
-- Your Python code isn't a spreadsheet,
-- Scott Import Excel. It's

608
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,500
not a spreadsheet.

609
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:25,089
-- No, but the point is this is an Excel problem. Not a spreadsheet problem.
-- And lever

610
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,310
-- office, I mean, functionally
-- office

611
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,780
-- does it
-- too. Yeah. Lever

612
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,359
office does it too because why not? Right. Let's all get in this crazy boat together

613
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:35,079
-- off the waterfall. Every, wouldn't
-- be one of those classic.

614
00:26:35,089 --> 00:26:36,880
No Excel, but we have to do it too.

615
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,550
-- I
-- think that's exactly what it is.

616
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,550
But, but anyway, I this is,

617
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,560
this is where I want to end it and I feel like wrapping it all together is

618
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,060
sometimes

619
00:26:46,199 --> 00:26:53,040
we have to cut that to that, that, that string that binds us to the past and say no more.

620
00:26:53,109 --> 00:26:54,520
This doesn't make sense,

621
00:26:54,699 --> 00:26:56,099
but at the same time,

622
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,449
the only way that happens

623
00:26:58,579 --> 00:27:02,130
is if we have kind of a coherent

624
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:05,329
singular strategy we can all work with.

625
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:07,530
And I think this is again where like it becomes a

626
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,170
problem is if we all want something different and silly,

627
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,209
nothing ever gets done.

628
00:27:11,219 --> 00:27:15,239
-- Well,
-- everybody wants defaults that serve their need versus, you know,

629
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,939
some globally optimum default that is safe, which

630
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:19,079
frankly is where we're going.

631
00:27:19,089 --> 00:27:22,180
Like you remember back in the day, 20 years ago, you know, Red Hat Linux,

632
00:27:22,189 --> 00:27:24,880
not Red Hat Enterprise but actual Red Hat Linux that you could like buy in

633
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,449
a box with a CD at like comp USA or Best Buy or whatever,

634
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:29,819
you know, came with all the services turned on by default.

635
00:27:29,829 --> 00:27:30,530
And I remember

636
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,910
all the vendors did that because otherwise people would

637
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,109
install a Linux and be like Telnet doesn't work.

638
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:36,630
Why does Telnet not work well because you have to

639
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,500
turn it on and they would like lose their minds.

640
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,959
And now of course, it's the opposite.

641
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:44,160
Pretty much. I think every Linux now ships with like SSH is turned on. That's it.

642
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,579
You get to turn everything else on,

643
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,150
you know, so we did it, we did it at the operating system level.

644
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,219
Why can't we do it at the application level?

645
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,410
I think it's time to start doing these things.

646
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:57,540
And I think these are two great examples of why it matters.

647
00:27:57,829 --> 00:28:00,859
And if we don't fix these problems,

648
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:03,619
things just get dumber and worse.

649
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:06,979
And these are, these are simple, simple problems to fix.

650
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:11,339
I mean, we know what we need to do. So. All right, I'm ending this here. This has been

651
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,699
a lovely conversation.

652
00:28:12,709 --> 00:28:17,280
So I have one extra note as part of the outro I tell everyone to go to open

653
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,619
source security podcast.com and that's now hosted on open source

654
00:28:20,739 --> 00:28:21,479
security dot io.

655
00:28:21,489 --> 00:28:23,890
The website we have because the open

656
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,699
source security podcast.com website was hosted on blogger

657
00:28:27,819 --> 00:28:29,180
and everything went insane

658
00:28:29,489 --> 00:28:32,310
and the blogger interface is now unusable.

659
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:36,869
And so in a fit of rage while I was publishing the last podcast episode,

660
00:28:37,209 --> 00:28:37,910
I

661
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,500
basically moved everything to the wordpress site we have so
