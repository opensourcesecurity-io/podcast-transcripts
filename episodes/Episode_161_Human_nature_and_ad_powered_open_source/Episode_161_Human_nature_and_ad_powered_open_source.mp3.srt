Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 161 with myself,

1
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,050
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:12,760
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:13,979
-- What's
-- new man?

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,930
-- Uh
-- Not much, not much just uh enjoying my kids being back in school.

5
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:20,690
It's beautiful, isn't

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,930
it? It's so nice.

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,610
No, I know I have the same joy.

8
00:00:24,979 --> 00:00:25,569
Right?

9
00:00:25,799 --> 00:00:30,770
So 161 take two, we, we had technical difficulties yesterday.

10
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:32,130
So we shall try again.

11
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,389
-- So anyway,
-- well, technically we were fine. It was the cloud that

12
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:39,400
the cloud who can trust it, right?

13
00:00:39,779 --> 00:00:42,840
Well, you see this is one of the things I love and hate about the cloud is

14
00:00:43,529 --> 00:00:46,319
effectively, I'm outsourcing something to the cloud,

15
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,080
which means on the one hand, I don't have to care about that thing.

16
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,090
Like it just hopefully works in the cloud.

17
00:00:51,099 --> 00:00:53,880
But conversely like when you outsource something, if it doesn't work,

18
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,639
it doesn't work and there's like nothing you can do

19
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,279
to fix it other than like stare at it and

20
00:00:59,669 --> 00:01:02,150
you know, try reconnecting or whatever

21
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:03,409
and,

22
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:07,610
and to be fair if you choose good cloud providers like Gmail is a great example.

23
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,819
Like Gmail goes out so rarely that it

24
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,379
literally makes international news when they have like,

25
00:01:12,389 --> 00:01:12,730
you know,

26
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:18,169
0.003% of all Gmail users were affected for 17 minutes on like last Thursday.

27
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,730
Now in fairness, 0.00 17% of all Gmail users is like

28
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,010
a million people.

29
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:24,000
You know,

30
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,440
like the last time when the admin console

31
00:01:25,449 --> 00:01:27,029
went down and I noticed immediately and then,

32
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,110
like, nobody could log in.

33
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,819
So I'm like,

34
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,519
well,

35
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,819
-- I guess we just take a 30 minute coffee break.
-- Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. I mean, it,

36
00:01:34,419 --> 00:01:35,620
although I guess I,

37
00:01:36,419 --> 00:01:38,209
I feel this as a human

38
00:01:38,419 --> 00:01:42,169
because I remember when things would break, you had something to do,

39
00:01:42,279 --> 00:01:46,470
I'm going to fix it. I'm busy. Leave me alone, I'm fixing the internet, it's broken

40
00:01:46,809 --> 00:01:47,610
and now

41
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:48,900
I

42
00:01:49,059 --> 00:01:51,019
will just sit here and do nothing.

43
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:55,230
You know, it really reminds me of is the exact same parallel between

44
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:57,589
people who feel safe driving in a car

45
00:01:57,949 --> 00:02:00,669
and those same people feel unsafe riding in an airplane

46
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:02,669
because that perception of control. Right.

47
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,120
Even though the car is statistically way insanely more dangerous than getting in a,

48
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:07,309
like commercial plane.

49
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,860
You know, there's that perception of control.

50
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,009
I'm driving a car, I'm in control of the car. You know, where was on an airplane?

51
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,039
It's like you're strapped in your seat,

52
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,800
shut up or we're going to have the air marshal tase you.

53
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,020
-- Right.
-- Right. Exactly. Exactly.

54
00:02:18,029 --> 00:02:22,899
And in fact, I'm a person who did not care for flying for a very long time.

55
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:27,020
And, like I knew in my brain it was statistically safer, like,

56
00:02:27,029 --> 00:02:28,860
driving to the airport was

57
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:30,169
1000 times more.

58
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,860
Bathroom at the airport is more dangerous.

59
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:35,179
Right. Seriously.

60
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,750
But, like, I did not like being on an airplane and now,

61
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:41,770
granted I've flown so many times, I just don't care anymore.

62
00:02:41,779 --> 00:02:42,050
But,

63
00:02:42,339 --> 00:02:44,289
I mean, I remember that and it's,

64
00:02:45,369 --> 00:02:47,440
it's the same thing with security. Right.

65
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:50,979
Where people think, oh, if I run, I run the server myself, it's more secure.

66
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:54,699
Or if I generate the, the, you know, private keys, it's more secure.

67
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,119
And the reality is,

68
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,639
you know what? It probably isn't.

69
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:01,880
Well, and especially, I hate to use Best of Breed,

70
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:04,550
but we are getting to a point where we have Best

71
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:09,000
of Breed solutions where let's put it bluntly hands up who here

72
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,570
has Intel build custom silicon into their CPU for that,

73
00:03:12,679 --> 00:03:16,960
you know, the answers. Almost nobody. And, uh, this is a podcast.

74
00:03:17,059 --> 00:03:21,059
-- You can't see them raising their hands.
-- Exactly, because it doesn't matter.

75
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,199
Um, ok.

76
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,059
Number two,

77
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,820
who here is building their own custom silicon

78
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,940
security code processors to put in their server.

79
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,250
Apple,

80
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,830
Apple, Microsoft and Google.

81
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:33,990
-- Maybe Amazon,
-- you

82
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:34,330
know.

83
00:03:34,429 --> 00:03:35,979
But, yeah, you're definitely,

84
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:40,059
you're in the top 10 companies on the planet if you can do that.

85
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,770
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's outside my budget. It,

86
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:44,759
skill set.

87
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,339
Well, not even skill set.

88
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,919
Like I couldn't even hire those people because

89
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:50,770
they're all busy working at those other places.

90
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:53,070
Right. Yes. That's exactly right.

91
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:56,789
-- I, I don't know any chip people who need jobs.
-- Yeah.

92
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,449
Yeah.

93
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,589
It's like every time I see, like,

94
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,710
why do logistics companies charge so much money for X?

95
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,990
And then it's like, but no, seriously, how do you ship an elephant,

96
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:06,029
like overnight one to Germany like that? That's complicated.

97
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:09,570
It, it amuses me to no end when people think

98
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:14,559
something is super easy and, and it's very like Dunning Kruger, right? Where it's,

99
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,250
oh, but if you only did this, it would be super simple.

100
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,548
And like my favorite example right now is

101
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,108
when people talk about running like a modern

102
00:04:22,119 --> 00:04:24,200
internet architecture for a company where it's like,

103
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:25,690
oh, you just need a couple of servers.

104
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,970
It's like holy cow. That's not how anything works anymore.

105
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:31,609
And just a quick phone call to Comcast.

106
00:04:32,429 --> 00:04:32,779
Yeah.

107
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,640
No, no, you're not. I remember we just did an episode of a hotel

108
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,250
doing those things. So the answer to that is absolutely not

109
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,589
it. And it, right anyway,

110
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:45,130
I mean, this is just

111
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,489
in security is the same way, right? Where it's always, oh, but if you just do this or,

112
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:50,679
well,

113
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,350
there was that really interesting thread on Twitter

114
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,950
where the GRC was talking about how,

115
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:55,109
you know,

116
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:58,119
he believes Android phones are more secure than Apple phones and that

117
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:02,029
he has some sort of bespoke android phones that he's locked down

118
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:03,239
completely.

119
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,750
And I'm inclined to believe him because he's a, he's generally a

120
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,369
competent individual. Yeah, competent and smart.

121
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:12,359
But, um, well, a couple of problems, one,

122
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:16,920
how do we know that he's done it correctly? Like, what has he done? Right.

123
00:05:16,929 --> 00:05:19,119
I, I didn't go bother looking for documentation, like,

124
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:21,320
you know, like, for example, the, um, oh, what is it?

125
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:24,839
The, the desa stig, you know, the secure technical implementation guidelines

126
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:25,529
with them,

127
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:29,160
you know, they, they have those for like Firefox web servers phones.

128
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,980
And, and honestly, like when I read the one for Mac O West, many years ago,

129
00:05:31,989 --> 00:05:35,250
it was I learned a lot because I was like, wait, there's a guest count by default

130
00:05:35,429 --> 00:05:36,640
that's enabled by default.

131
00:05:37,179 --> 00:05:39,359
I did not know that prior to reading that because it,

132
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:40,769
it doesn't show up in the login screen.

133
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:42,100
Like when you go to the user account,

134
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,320
it's there and you're like guest account. What's this?

135
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,640
Um So obviously, you know, disable that things like that.

136
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:50,500
And so these decent sts are pretty good and,

137
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,299
and I assume that's kind of what the GRC is doing.

138
00:05:52,309 --> 00:05:52,720
Like he's,

139
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,609
I assume he's not doing custom software firmware

140
00:05:55,619 --> 00:05:57,140
-- or like a custom version of Android
-- O

141
00:05:57,359 --> 00:06:01,380
it might be custom actually because I've been watching

142
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,200
some of his comments about this and I,

143
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:04,799
I haven't found any concrete details,

144
00:06:04,809 --> 00:06:07,420
but it sounds like it is not connected to Google's

145
00:06:07,429 --> 00:06:11,100
servers and he has his own like custom app store.

146
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,359
Couldn't you just firewall that, like,

147
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:16,989
have like a little firewall app in there that blocks access to Google servers.

148
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,700
I mean, well, you could, or if you build your own version of Android,

149
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:23,174
it doesn't come with the Google Play anything installed.

150
00:06:23,184 --> 00:06:25,154
In fact, I've,

151
00:06:25,165 --> 00:06:29,255
I've done more Android modding than I ever want to remember some years back.

152
00:06:29,265 --> 00:06:29,734
And

153
00:06:29,904 --> 00:06:32,084
when you build your own version of Android, like,

154
00:06:32,095 --> 00:06:33,445
none of the Google Play stuff is in it.

155
00:06:33,454 --> 00:06:34,315
You actually have to side

156
00:06:34,424 --> 00:06:36,174
note it all to make it work.

157
00:06:36,184 --> 00:06:39,174
But anyways, like, even, even if you get one of those phones, I, you know,

158
00:06:39,184 --> 00:06:41,355
does it just does everything work or do you have to

159
00:06:41,364 --> 00:06:43,005
jump through all these hoops to get stuff to work?

160
00:06:43,295 --> 00:06:46,855
You know, like I had the same experience with the, um, I bought some Android.

161
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,815
Um, what do you call them fire tablets?

162
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,570
Uh, quite lovely.

163
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:54,660
But, you know, they don't have the Google App store and I wanted, uh, oh, yeah,

164
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,609
it was Minecraft, right?

165
00:06:55,619 --> 00:06:57,359
Because like kids love Minecraft

166
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:02,399
and like I got the Google App store loaded, side loaded, whatever and it

167
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,250
got Minecraft onto it.

168
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,000
And then like two weeks later, it just broke horribly and it, like,

169
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,239
wanted the App Store to update and I just couldn't.

170
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:14,779
So I gave up and luckily at that point, Minecraft was available in the Amazon store.

171
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,790
So problem solved.

172
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:20,140
But, um, you know, I'm a pretty technical user and even for me, I was like, I gave up.

173
00:07:20,489 --> 00:07:25,809
It's not easy. I did it once. I, so some years back it's been, it's been a while.

174
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,299
I bought uh, one of the, the cheapest

175
00:07:28,619 --> 00:07:31,149
fire tablet because Amazon makes them and I

176
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,970
just needed it to literally read books on.

177
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:34,540
And

178
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,140
I thought I'll try this instead of

179
00:07:37,299 --> 00:07:39,459
the Kindle, the, the

180
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,779
thing. Right.

181
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,459
And, and yeah, I tried sideloading the Google play stuff and it was, it was terrible.

182
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,380
Like it was unbelievably bad.

183
00:07:47,549 --> 00:07:49,100
What gets me, I mean, back to the cloud.

184
00:07:49,109 --> 00:07:52,660
This is the whole thing of, I don't want to be an expert in all things.

185
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:56,100
-- That's right.
-- Right. And more to the point, I don't have the time for it. Like, like

186
00:07:56,312 --> 00:07:56,352
I,

187
00:07:56,523 --> 00:07:57,743
I can, I can do

188
00:07:57,893 --> 00:08:00,532
DKIM, I can do SPF I can set all that up but man

189
00:08:00,673 --> 00:08:02,342
maintaining all the DKIM keys and making

190
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:03,102
sure they're

191
00:08:03,782 --> 00:08:06,222
actually signing because I had it set up on one server

192
00:08:06,233 --> 00:08:08,213
and then it just stopped signing the email for some reason.

193
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:09,683
-- I still don't understand
-- why

194
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:13,743
email is one of those things that I think is notorious for people saying, oh,

195
00:08:13,752 --> 00:08:16,153
it's super easy to run your own email server and like

196
00:08:16,303 --> 00:08:17,613
it's super easy to run

197
00:08:17,855 --> 00:08:19,096
a email server.

198
00:08:19,105 --> 00:08:23,585
-- It's super hard to actually manage an email infrastructure
-- and

199
00:08:23,596 --> 00:08:26,365
to get everybody talking to your server and vice versa.

200
00:08:27,376 --> 00:08:30,686
You know, like I had problems where we were running email servers. We still do

201
00:08:30,946 --> 00:08:32,775
and because we don't send enough email,

202
00:08:32,785 --> 00:08:35,116
there's a couple of spam appliances that are like, you might be spamming,

203
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:35,856
you might not be spamming.

204
00:08:35,866 --> 00:08:38,125
We haven't seen enough email from you to tell one way or the other.

205
00:08:38,135 --> 00:08:38,885
And I'm like, right,

206
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:39,659
I,

207
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,859
I literally at one point considered telling marketing

208
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:43,000
to send more email and I'm like,

209
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,200
that might not be the answer.

210
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:45,140
Um

211
00:08:45,489 --> 00:08:48,960
But right, like I'm like, how do I solve that problem? I can't.

212
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,239
Well, I remember the the spam is what ended me.

213
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,359
I ran my own email server for decades and,

214
00:08:55,729 --> 00:08:59,359
and I just, I couldn't, I got sick of fighting spam and I was like, you win spam.

215
00:08:59,369 --> 00:09:02,440
I'm switching to gmail and that was the end of that. And like,

216
00:09:02,789 --> 00:09:06,460
do I wish I had more control over everything? I'm doing well? Sure.

217
00:09:06,469 --> 00:09:09,289
But I also like having free time

218
00:09:09,429 --> 00:09:10,260
because I

219
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:12,400
spam is a full time job.

220
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:13,690
-- Yeah.
-- So I,

221
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,349
yeah, on the one hand, I really hate this centralization, you know,

222
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:19,929
and I hate this like, I, I will never like,

223
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,239
I'm terrified that one day I do something weird

224
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,789
and Google boots me out of their system.

225
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:24,210
Oh,

226
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,590
I know, man. I know actually. So it's funny you say that is.

227
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,729
So to give you an idea how paranoid I am.

228
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:35,359
My Android phone backs my pictures up to Google and I back them up to Amazon

229
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:40,239
because I figure getting kicked off both services at the same time is probably,

230
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,729
I, I won't say it's out of the question but I think the odds are low.

231
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,640
Don't, don't, don't say that

232
00:09:47,479 --> 00:09:47,530
famous

233
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,989
last words.

234
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:49,690
Yeah.

235
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:54,280
So, and, but, but, and I get it though because especially,

236
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:54,729
you know,

237
00:09:54,739 --> 00:09:56,390
there's a lot of industries and

238
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,869
government that have regulations about maintaining,

239
00:09:59,229 --> 00:10:00,380
not perceived control,

240
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,549
but actually maintaining control of their data and their stuff.

241
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:05,450
And

242
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:09,609
you're asking them to like, oh yeah, trust this like company in the US to just do it.

243
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:10,809
So

244
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,950
there's a couple

245
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:12,880
and not to pick on the US.

246
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,549
-- But like all the major cloud providers mostly are out of the
-- US.

247
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:18,369
No, no, they are. Absolutely. And

248
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,729
so, I mean, so my argument with this is

249
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,799
I'll pick on the,

250
00:10:22,809 --> 00:10:26,419
the department of Defense because there's actually a ton of news right now.

251
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:28,140
There's this big cloud project they're doing

252
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,049
called Jedi because they love their fancy acronyms

253
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:32,979
and basically it,

254
00:10:32,989 --> 00:10:37,340
it sounds like it's coming down to kind of Amazon and Microsoft as the two possible.

255
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,450
Right.

256
00:10:39,609 --> 00:10:40,320
Anyway,

257
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,140
like

258
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:44,890
-- it's not gonna be
-- just run it on Facebook. It'll be fine. Everyone,

259
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:46,900
let everyone friend each other.

260
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:50,780
But the thing is when you look at an organization like that,

261
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:55,909
they literally have basically like thousands of little data centers everywhere,

262
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:56,109
right?

263
00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:58,380
And there's tons of duplication of effort and there's,

264
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,229
you're constantly, I mean, you know, people coming and going constantly, I mean,

265
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:02,710
in some cases people are like,

266
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,989
you know, they're, they're going out into the field and they may never come back

267
00:11:06,109 --> 00:11:09,429
just, you know, it's like, it's crazy to think about. And so

268
00:11:09,859 --> 00:11:11,210
in some instances,

269
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,770
they require a certain amount of control,

270
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,789
but they also struggle to have it because

271
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:18,070
of just all the disparity in their environment.

272
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,380
So, I don't know, I can kind of see it both ways.

273
00:11:20,489 --> 00:11:21,929
I think you can make an argument

274
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,500
in either direction to be perfectly honest.

275
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:29,080
Well, I think what will happen is like any industry, it will mature to the point where

276
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,969
the vast majority of people

277
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,450
just by grid power.

278
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,489
And if they absolutely need,

279
00:11:34,719 --> 00:11:36,650
you know, backups to make sure, you know, like,

280
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:39,690
because there's a lot of machinery and stuff out there that if you kill power to it,

281
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,330
it basically eats itself or something terrible happens, you know,

282
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,900
so you really want it on battery backup or generator or whatever.

283
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:47,570
Well, look at hospitals,

284
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,349
hospitals.

285
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,020
Yeah.

286
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,760
And so yeah, there's a legit need for, you know, handling that half hour hour outage.

287
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:55,619
But by and large,

288
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,909
everybody just buys grid power unless you're like

289
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,580
so far out in the middle of nowhere that

290
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,200
they're, you know, they're just not going to run a wire to you.

291
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:07,000
Conversely, even the solutions for that use case have become much

292
00:12:07,205 --> 00:12:09,734
like, uh did you read uh what was it? I think it was Zimbabwe

293
00:12:10,155 --> 00:12:13,825
is deploying Tesla power walls to a lot of their cellphone infrastructure.

294
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:14,434
I

295
00:12:14,655 --> 00:12:18,424
did not hear these power walls are about 6500 bucks a pop.

296
00:12:18,565 --> 00:12:20,325
There's two per cell phone base station.

297
00:12:20,335 --> 00:12:23,864
It's going to about a third of their base stations across the whole country

298
00:12:24,289 --> 00:12:28,640
because the Zimbabwean Minister of, I think it was tech or economics.

299
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:29,690
Anyways, basically, he's like,

300
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,090
yeah, we need mobile because that's our economy.

301
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:33,500
That's how everybody pays each other.

302
00:12:33,849 --> 00:12:34,409
And that makes sense.

303
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,750
So if it breaks we, it, like, you just turned our economy off and that's a problem.

304
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:41,890
And so what I love though is like in past,

305
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:47,869
imagine 20 years ago I go, Josh, I, I have a, I have a project for you. I need you

306
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:51,320
to get uninterruptable power supplies that will run for about, you know,

307
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,510
10 or 12 hours

308
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,969
at a bunch of cell phone based stations with me so far and you're like, sure,

309
00:12:55,979 --> 00:12:56,440
whatever.

310
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,989
And then I'm like, but they're in Zimbabwe.

311
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,229
Right. And at that point you probably quit and go home.

312
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:01,570
Right.

313
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,929
The logistics of handling that and the technology to do that would, would have been,

314
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:08,729
yeah, like just, it would have been and, and the cost would have been a ridiculous.

315
00:13:08,739 --> 00:13:12,299
So, and, and now it's just like, yeah, we need a couple of 1000 power walls,

316
00:13:12,309 --> 00:13:15,090
drag them in, on trucks, not even big trucks

317
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,250
and, and you're done,

318
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,010
you know,

319
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,289
and, and I see that's where cloud is headed.

320
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,559
You know, there's so many of these cloud services where

321
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,729
you know, the outages are becoming rarer.

322
00:13:24,739 --> 00:13:26,869
And also, uh, like,

323
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,380
one thing I really like about cloud flare

324
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,650
is their outages are always kind of interesting.

325
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:35,390
You know, they're never like, sort of a silly, silly thing. They're actually

326
00:13:35,739 --> 00:13:37,169
something kind of interesting.

327
00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:39,630
And where, what's, what I really love though is,

328
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,010
is cloud flare seems to be one of those

329
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,719
providers that does all like a really solid post mortem

330
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,830
and well, hopefully like the airline industry then fixes it.

331
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,909
So it never happens again and ideally fixes

332
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,770
it so that other things never happen again.

333
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,049
You know, those near misses

334
00:13:52,219 --> 00:13:55,869
or, you know, because basically every failure is not just a failure,

335
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,349
it's a chain of failures, right?

336
00:13:57,359 --> 00:13:58,859
That resulted in something horrible.

337
00:13:59,299 --> 00:14:02,039
Um, pretty much in any industrial or it setting. Right.

338
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,440
It's almost never just one

339
00:14:03,669 --> 00:14:04,039
thing

340
00:14:04,359 --> 00:14:05,640
definitely, you know,

341
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:06,450
um,

342
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,460
like Google their control plane pooped out and then

343
00:14:09,469 --> 00:14:11,000
they couldn't talk to each other and they're like,

344
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,830
well, how do we resolve this issue when we can't talk to each other?

345
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,080
You know, things like that,

346
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,500
same thing with cloud flare.

347
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:17,479
And so

348
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:21,900
that's the thing, you know, if, if this industry matures like

349
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,940
air travel has, I mean,

350
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:25,010
cool.

351
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,520
That's what we want, right.

352
00:14:26,719 --> 00:14:29,450
This boring service that you buy that just works.

353
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,770
And then when they have an outage it's so rare. It makes

354
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:32,719
-- news
-- and

355
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:36,489
I, I think that has to be the future of security also

356
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:42,010
because today's security is like a snowflake in a lot of organizations and

357
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,369
even products

358
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,289
and it should just be like the boring thing. That's always there.

359
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:48,770
It's like, if, if, if you rent,

360
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:52,940
I, I don't know, let's say you're renting space like an office somewhere, right.

361
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,979
Are you going to worry about all the locks on the doors?

362
00:14:55,989 --> 00:14:59,250
Are you going to put your own locks on the door? You know, generally speaking. No,

363
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:03,330
with, with some people. Yeah. Sure. But most people, nah, they don't really care.

364
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,650
It's not even that they don't care.

365
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:06,210
They don't even know that it's a thing you need to make.

366
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:08,489
We do well, and they don't have to care. Right?

367
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,239
Because it's just, you,

368
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,669
you assume if I'm renting office space in a building that like the front

369
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:17,340
door isn't flapping open all night long and they have some reasonable controls,

370
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,750
keeping my stuff relatively safe.

371
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,159
Yeah. No, a great example, Firefox just did a version,

372
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,950
uh that enables a whole bunch of privacy stuff by default.

373
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,489
And then they're actually apparently going to be deploying

374
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,590
that those defaults to existing versions of the browser

375
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:33,690
they need. I mean,

376
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:33,969
I,

377
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:38,909
I'm always torn over this because I, I mean, I run Firefox. I love Firefox and

378
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,070
they,

379
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,719
I'm, I'm,

380
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,590
I think they could do more. I think they're doing ok.

381
00:15:45,849 --> 00:15:48,210
And one of the challenges though I see is

382
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,489
if they try to set themselves up as the Anti

383
00:15:50,619 --> 00:15:52,369
Google, which I think they kind of are,

384
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:55,400
that's a weird place to be in. Right.

385
00:15:55,929 --> 00:15:57,190
Don't they get a lot of their funding from?

386
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,390
Yes, they do.

387
00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:00,539
Awkward.

388
00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:04,320
Well, and unfortunately if you look at Firefox usage it's,

389
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,359
it's been declining now for, for a long time.

390
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:08,320
And

391
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:11,080
I, I feel like just being the anti

392
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,580
Google isn't enough.

393
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,940
Well, I mean, yeah.

394
00:16:14,369 --> 00:16:14,669
Yeah.

395
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:15,349
No, you have to,

396
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,770
you have to offer something better and more like what got

397
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,539
me initially with Chrome was just the performance and stability.

398
00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:21,020
Holy cow.

399
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:24,219
I, I mean, I remember when Chrome came out, like I was,

400
00:16:24,229 --> 00:16:28,200
I was fairly involved in helping Firefox or security stuff back then

401
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,539
and like Chrome was doing some amazing things where they were,

402
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:33,429
you know, they were spawning lots of processes and they were doing

403
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:34,640
all different

404
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:35,229
kind of

405
00:16:35,455 --> 00:16:37,945
magic rendering things inside of there.

406
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:42,145
And, and I mean, this was back when like your browser crashed like five times a day.

407
00:16:42,604 --> 00:16:43,575
That's what browser did.

408
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,385
I would run like multiple instances of Firefox separately

409
00:16:50,044 --> 00:16:52,395
effectively to get one process per tab.

410
00:16:52,984 --> 00:16:57,094
And I mean, now they all kind of do this, Firefox does it as well and they do,

411
00:16:57,104 --> 00:16:58,335
they do great, right?

412
00:16:58,344 --> 00:17:02,145
It's I I run Firefox uh for days at a time

413
00:17:02,549 --> 00:17:04,290
and I have no issues with it.

414
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:04,790
And in fact,

415
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,858
I think Firefox has been more stable lately

416
00:17:06,868 --> 00:17:08,410
than Chrome was when I was running Chrome,

417
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,410
which is, which is awesome.

418
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,819
I love that. But yeah, I, I feel like you need, you need more anti

419
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,680
Google isn't enough yet

420
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,368
yet. Give it time.

421
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:16,800
Anyway,

422
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:21,770
all you need to tell me you've been claiming there's a topic of open source ads

423
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,430
and you won't tell me what it is though.

424
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,329
-- And this is driving me insane and you must tell me.
-- OK,

425
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,800
-- so the deal was there is N PM
-- node package manager.

426
00:17:31,209 --> 00:17:33,459
-- Yeah,
-- it's for managing javascript libraries.

427
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:36,420
All the website people are using it.

428
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,339
This developer maintains this package called Standard.

429
00:17:40,349 --> 00:17:41,560
Literally, that's the name of the package.

430
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:45,410
He does this for free, which is nice of him.

431
00:17:45,729 --> 00:17:50,260
But like a lot of people doing stuff for free, they also need to have money to buy food

432
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:51,560
and internet.

433
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:52,599
Yeah.

434
00:17:52,829 --> 00:17:55,780
So he did an advertising thing in

435
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,540
the standard library

436
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:02,130
that advertised like on the terminal when you were like using it and installing it.

437
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,239
And he got uh two who was it?

438
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,130
He got two companies to buy advertising space on it and they

439
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,280
obviously backed it when this whole thing went south real fast.

440
00:18:11,619 --> 00:18:12,250
Um

441
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,890
But yeah, you know, it's like because,

442
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,930
you know, we, we,

443
00:18:15,939 --> 00:18:19,209
we ended up with uh advertising on what was it use net with the

444
00:18:19,219 --> 00:18:22,810
cantor and Segel green card thing way back in the day and then email

445
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,099
and then, you know, advertising on the web. And,

446
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:29,520
but you know, we've never really had advertising on your text based terminal.

447
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:30,160
Thank goodness.

448
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:33,790
And, and to be clear. I don't want advertising on my text based terminal either.

449
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,630
Uh, no, I detest ads

450
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,750
also that there's a good reason this podcast doesn't have ads.

451
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,680
But if you have enough money, we're open to sponsorship.

452
00:18:44,689 --> 00:18:49,469
-- To be clear,
-- it would have to be a huge bag of money and we won't put ads on our podcast.

453
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:51,550
You'll just have to give it to us. So,

454
00:18:51,819 --> 00:18:52,969
you're still open to that though.

455
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:53,880
But,

456
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,020
yeah,

457
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,550
but anyway, so yeah, I mean, he put ads in the terminal and

458
00:18:59,089 --> 00:18:59,890
how did I miss?

459
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,599
I generally keep up on this

460
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:01,829
kind

461
00:19:01,949 --> 00:19:01,969
of

462
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:03,489
like,

463
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,229
well, anyway,

464
00:19:05,369 --> 00:19:08,160
so anyways N PM has come out and banned ads.

465
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:11,319
So what's interesting is like because talking about software freedoms, right?

466
00:19:11,329 --> 00:19:13,000
The open source software freedoms thing.

467
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,319
Like shouldn't the author of a package have the freedom to put ads into his thing.

468
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:20,209
-- But conversely N PM doesn't have to distribute
-- you.

469
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,869
Right. That, that's fair.

470
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,760
So I think this is a reasonable trade off. But more to the point,

471
00:19:26,474 --> 00:19:27,255
I just, I,

472
00:19:27,265 --> 00:19:31,474
I question how effective or useful these ads would be and what really gets me is just

473
00:19:31,645 --> 00:19:34,614
the amount of time and effort they're going to waste

474
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,375
and people either trying to turn them off or like,

475
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,994
what's this weird junk in my file in my log files

476
00:19:40,175 --> 00:19:42,694
or whatever? You know, because like I run this one,

477
00:19:42,805 --> 00:19:46,474
I use this one package called gam. It's a Google account manager or something.

478
00:19:46,484 --> 00:19:50,675
It's a really nice set of uh apps to connect to your Google account and like, run,

479
00:19:50,744 --> 00:19:53,925
like export all your Google groups and who's in them and what the settings are.

480
00:19:54,275 --> 00:19:55,574
Right? Really handy.

481
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,390
And it does this one thing that I love and drives me nuts is

482
00:19:58,829 --> 00:20:01,270
when you run it, it checks if it's up to date and if it's not up to date,

483
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,839
it updates itself and then it runs the command you told it to which I love, right?

484
00:20:04,849 --> 00:20:06,760
Once in a while, it means I get a really slow run.

485
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:10,079
But the problem is I pipe all the output into files so I can record this.

486
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:13,959
And so every once in a while my parsing breaks because at the top of it is like this,

487
00:20:13,969 --> 00:20:14,349
you know,

488
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:14,569
G

489
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:19,400
A version 5.46 detected is old, you know, installing 547, blah, blah, blah.

490
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,199
It's like, it's like about 78 lines of text.

491
00:20:21,209 --> 00:20:23,650
And so now what I do is I just run G A manually

492
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:25,390
and then I run my reports,

493
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,150
you know, so I don't if it has to updated updates and,

494
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,310
but I'm ok with that because the trade off is I get an up to date version of G.

495
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:35,709
That's right. That's a benefit to me. That's a major benefit to me.

496
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:39,140
And I could totally get my script to ignore those front lines. I just whatever.

497
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:42,550
But um but like advertising, generally speaking,

498
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,530
advertising is not a benefit to me.

499
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,780
I'm like the, literally the number of ads I've seen where I'm like, oh, wow.

500
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,510
I'm, I'm really glad I found out about that.

501
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:52,989
I think the number of times that's happened in my life is about three times in total.

502
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,260
So, especially when you start, like, it's one thing for me to have to spend

503
00:20:57,364 --> 00:20:59,785
the cognitive load of like, oh, that's an ad I can ignore it

504
00:20:59,974 --> 00:21:01,385
versus now I have to like,

505
00:21:01,395 --> 00:21:03,744
I'm going through my log files or whatever and like the

506
00:21:03,755 --> 00:21:06,104
stuff is getting mangled and chewed up because there's like an,

507
00:21:06,114 --> 00:21:09,724
there's an ad stuck in there with the URL that I, I just, I feel like the,

508
00:21:09,734 --> 00:21:15,275
the benefit to the cost is just the, the that equation is out of whack and no one and

509
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:16,265
more to the point you're,

510
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,984
you're assaulting for that one last place where tech people don't have to see ads.

511
00:21:20,324 --> 00:21:23,224
And yeah, I'm, I'm guessing they're going to defend it staunchly.

512
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,979
Oh, man. I, I feel like there's so much wrong with this.

513
00:21:27,349 --> 00:21:28,020
Now,

514
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:31,780
I will also say there's the aspect of people who

515
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:35,810
write open source are underappreciated and often aren't paid.

516
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,119
And there's many arguments in many different directions here.

517
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:42,060
I mean, you could argue that, well, that's just the way it works, you know, and, and,

518
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:44,530
and, and it is, and, and that's part of it.

519
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,219
And of course,

520
00:21:45,229 --> 00:21:47,329
this is also one of those situations where this guy's

521
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,520
library would never be popular if it was close.

522
00:21:51,069 --> 00:21:52,380
I mean, that's just the reality of it.

523
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:55,469
The slippery slope, I guess I keep thinking of is so,

524
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:59,260
if you go and you put ads in your library in some way

525
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:02,920
and it generates you revenue, uh, I bet you can make a lot more money

526
00:22:03,339 --> 00:22:07,189
-- if somebody paid you to put a back door in your library.
-- Crypto mining.

527
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,199
Right. Right. Exactly. Exactly. That, I mean, in fact, what was it?

528
00:22:11,209 --> 00:22:13,380
The Pirate Bay was doing that at one point where you'd go

529
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:16,239
to their website and they would start mining crypto in your browser.

530
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,500
That's one of the new protections.

531
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:21,199
The latest version of Firefox has is protections against crypto mining, which,

532
00:22:21,979 --> 00:22:25,000
yeah, it's uh 2019 folks.

533
00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:26,239
That's the thing now,

534
00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:30,439
like it's common enough that Firefox is actually fixing it by default

535
00:22:30,829 --> 00:22:33,239
and, and you know what else I will say about Firefox?

536
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,180
Here's the other thing kind of on this ad.

537
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:38,459
I, I guess complaining session here is

538
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,280
like on my Android phone,

539
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:43,810
Google Chrome, you, you cannot make it block ads.

540
00:22:43,819 --> 00:22:47,699
Whereas Firefox on, on your Android phone, you can install an ad blocker.

541
00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:48,630
And I think like

542
00:22:48,819 --> 00:22:51,520
that's a place where being kind of the anti

543
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,640
Google is a huge plus because you can say, look,

544
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:57,459
you can block ads because ads are terrible.

545
00:22:57,469 --> 00:23:00,260
It's not even that ads are terrible. I found on mobile. I can't,

546
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,199
I can read the news on the CBC, the

547
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:06,819
broadcast corporation because it's, we don't really have ads on that site.

548
00:23:06,829 --> 00:23:10,270
But I go to, when I go to American news sites, I, I can't read the content.

549
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,510
Some of them are terrible.

550
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,609
And in fact, I was, I was trying to use chrome and for some reason,

551
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:18,109
chrome on my phone opened some link and I was

552
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:19,930
like looking through the site and at one point like a

553
00:23:19,939 --> 00:23:22,209
video literally appeared in the middle of the screen and I

554
00:23:22,219 --> 00:23:24,449
could not figure out how to make it go away.

555
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:26,349
I assume I had to just watch it all.

556
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,630
And that's when I just copied the link

557
00:23:29,209 --> 00:23:31,839
and pasted it into Firefox and everything was great

558
00:23:32,229 --> 00:23:33,680
and just odd.

559
00:23:33,689 --> 00:23:38,920
It's like we are living in an ad dystopia and it's infecting open source now.

560
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:39,790
Well, it's, it's

561
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:43,780
ads, I mean, they've, they've essentially done as much as they can on TV,

562
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,839
on radio in the physical world.

563
00:23:45,849 --> 00:23:46,520
You know, uh,

564
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,290
it's one thing I want to visit Hawaii.

565
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,219
-- You know, one of the reasons I want to visit Hawaii, they outlawed
-- billboards.

566
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:51,380
Right.

567
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,339
Long time ago,

568
00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:52,930
-- I
-- think

569
00:23:52,939 --> 00:23:54,060
-- Vermont did
-- too.

570
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,380
I would like to know what does the world actually look like

571
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:59,300
without billboards because I've never experienced

572
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,780
that outside of a national park.

573
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,339
Right. Right. And you're not wrong,

574
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,010
you know.

575
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:09,599
No, II, I know, I feel like it is ridiculous and I would love to get rid of it,

576
00:24:09,609 --> 00:24:12,069
-- but I don't know
-- how I'm, you know what,

577
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:14,939
I'm super hopeful for augmented reality glasses.

578
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:15,640
A

579
00:24:15,869 --> 00:24:16,699
black

580
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:21,530
straight up, just put the mono lease over everything or hell anything.

581
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,530
Literally,

582
00:24:22,739 --> 00:24:24,530
I want to see pictures of dogs

583
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:25,089
when,

584
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:30,010
-- when there's an ad
-- just like go through Reddit slash R slash R

585
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,560
and, you know, and

586
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:34,530
I use that to fill the ad space.

587
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,979
Yeah. Right. Right. I would love that.

588
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,560
It is. I don't know.

589
00:24:39,569 --> 00:24:43,140
I feel like it's frustrating and it's, it's one of those things where

590
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,380
I, I, you know,

591
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,339
so much research has been done where

592
00:24:46,349 --> 00:24:48,854
all these ad networks keep distributing malware

593
00:24:49,244 --> 00:24:49,875
on the systems.

594
00:24:49,885 --> 00:24:53,635
And, I mean, I don't know how these ads worked in the standard library.

595
00:24:53,645 --> 00:24:57,334
But imagine if you're like, if you install a library and it ends up,

596
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,334
like downloading arbitrary garbage

597
00:24:59,444 --> 00:25:01,175
from some ad network,

598
00:25:01,354 --> 00:25:04,135
like that's probably really bad.

599
00:25:04,675 --> 00:25:05,084
Yeah.

600
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:09,375
Well, I, yeah, I know, it really calls the trustworthiness of it into question.

601
00:25:09,385 --> 00:25:12,984
And also like, does your build fail because the ad network doesn't serve you an ad?

602
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,459
It would be.

603
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,189
-- Oh, my goodness.
-- The future is now, man,

604
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,920
I just, the thought of that makes me

605
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:21,770
just,

606
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:28,479
yeah. Yeah. I want to go brush my teeth. Yeah. No, it's just, and it's so,

607
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,430
like I said, I just can't imagine that the advertising made

608
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:34,910
anywhere near enough money to justify this.

609
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,729
I have no idea.

610
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,270
It, it probably not because, I mean, I know most of these ads,

611
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:45,430
people are selling and going through our paltry where it's like a couple of bucks.

612
00:25:45,439 --> 00:25:47,849
-- It's never, it's never a lot of money.
-- Oh, yeah.

613
00:25:47,859 --> 00:25:48,069
I mean,

614
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:50,500
when I ran Google ads on my personal website back in the day

615
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,709
when I actually had a lot of traffic and it paid quite well.

616
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:55,270
I mean, I was at most making one or $200 a month.

617
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:57,449
Yeah. I, I believe that.

618
00:25:57,459 --> 00:26:00,839
I think you need, like, literally hundreds of millions of views

619
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:04,290
on a consistent basis to actually pull in any revenue.

620
00:26:04,349 --> 00:26:08,160
And, and these days I know, like, for example, in, in like the podcast world

621
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:12,979
where what happens is you get like a, you know, a magic link or something or, you know,

622
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:14,339
enter this code

623
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:17,160
and, and these advertisers are obviously they,

624
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:19,969
they're analyzing that data heavily to understand, you know,

625
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:21,469
what's paying off and what's not,

626
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:25,250
what a lot of them are doing is linking, you know, like we, we will pay you for each sale

627
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:26,140
five bucks

628
00:26:26,689 --> 00:26:26,709
or

629
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:26,930
whatever,

630
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:27,339
you

631
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:27,550
know.

632
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:27,750
Yeah.

633
00:26:28,349 --> 00:26:28,739
And

634
00:26:28,969 --> 00:26:31,500
the ads I hate ads, I hate them so much.

635
00:26:31,739 --> 00:26:35,140
So, I don't know. And, and, but I do worry about this encroaching

636
00:26:35,349 --> 00:26:36,819
of advertising into,

637
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:40,099
you know, like max headroom, you know, blip

638
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:40,939
Verts, it's like, well,

639
00:26:40,949 --> 00:26:43,349
if we slow down their heads stop exploding so we

640
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:45,479
just push up right to that line and we're good.

641
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:48,079
Yeah. Right. What's Max headroom?

642
00:26:48,709 --> 00:26:50,890
That's got to be like 30 plus years at this

643
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:51,050
point.

644
00:26:51,619 --> 00:26:51,630
Oh,

645
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,599
-- Lord. Wow. Now, I feel
-- old

646
00:26:53,729 --> 00:26:57,530
and actually it's funny because they had to dress up a real person to look like a

647
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:01,189
computer generated like avatar because they actually didn't

648
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:03,800
have the technology to make a computer generated avatar

649
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:04,890
at the time.

650
00:27:05,209 --> 00:27:09,719
That's like, I, I love when, when people talk about like, the fake mood landings.

651
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:13,000
And I remember I watched a youtube video of this, like, uh, uh,

652
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:15,750
video producer one time there was basically like, look,

653
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,319
the technology didn't exist to do this in the sixties.

654
00:27:18,329 --> 00:27:19,750
Like, let's break it down.

655
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,060
And it's like, even if they wanted to fake it, they couldn't have just because

656
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:25,439
you couldn't,

657
00:27:25,449 --> 00:27:28,520
you couldn't do those things in a studio no matter how much money you had.

658
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,010
Ok. So anyway, we should, we should wrap this one up.

659
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:35,979
So I guess, and an open source, I feel sad for learning about this.

660
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:39,459
I feel sad that the guy felt he had no other options.

661
00:27:39,709 --> 00:27:43,180
That's, that's a story for another day. And I agree with that.

662
00:27:43,189 --> 00:27:45,839
I mean, there's organizations starting to look into some of this.

663
00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:48,780
Like Tide Lift is one, for example, where they're trying to pay

664
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:51,540
some open source contributors. But I mean, even then

665
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,829
I, I'm suspicious

666
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,089
that anyone's going to feed their family

667
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,530
on just open source in, in that way.

668
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:03,479
It's II I think, I, I don't know, I feel like there's something has to change here.

669
00:28:03,489 --> 00:28:05,449
I, I'm not sure because,

670
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:10,119
well, long story short, there are a lot of people who do get paid to do this,

671
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,119
just maybe not

672
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:15,219
100% of their day job or it's a, it's a big enough chunk of their day job that they,

673
00:28:15,229 --> 00:28:16,380
they do make a living doing this.

674
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:20,770
But it, I, I always come back to sort of the whole art thing and oh, we need copyright.

675
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,609
So artists will make art. No, we don't need copyright.

676
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:24,069
So artists will make art because people will make

677
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:26,119
art no matter what because there's people out there who

678
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:27,800
have to make art otherwise they get like all

679
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,760
twitchy and weird and they go and they make art

680
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:33,030
now ideally should people who create something of value

681
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,709
that so many people use and also get value from

682
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:39,349
and that like in some cases literally underpins a lot of the world.

683
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,829
Should we maybe make sure they can feed themselves well. Yeah.

684
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,489
Yeah, that should be sustainable, you know, back to the old red hat thing, you know,

685
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,680
is this sustainable

686
00:28:47,979 --> 00:28:48,359
it?

687
00:28:48,369 --> 00:28:52,089
Well, it better be because like we need G lip C, whether we like it or not, we need,

688
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:54,040
you know, Firefox, whether we like it or not.

689
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:58,260
I, I think that's, that's a fine place to end it. So thank you, Kurt.
