Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,670
Kurt Siegfried and my partner in trying to fix computers.

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,479
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:18,639
-- I don't try to fix computers. I mostly don't fix computers.
-- I've actually have luck.

4
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:21,309
I've got the, uh, the backup server is reliably

5
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,149
backing up the other server

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,430
and now I need to figure out how to get tail scale with SSH,

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,329
so I can move the server to my parents' house.

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,700
-- Ah,
-- I see. I see. That's fair.

9
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:31,229
Yeah, because I,

10
00:00:31,336 --> 00:00:35,486
I will cry if I have to go download like, 10 terabytes of data from the internet.

11
00:00:35,497 --> 00:00:40,117
-- That is totally not copyright infringement.
-- Uh, do I have 10 terabytes?

12
00:00:40,126 --> 00:00:40,277
No,

13
00:00:40,286 --> 00:00:45,376
my backup I back up to S3 is like 2.5 terabytes of

14
00:00:45,387 --> 00:00:48,556
stuff and then it goes into Glacier and it costs me,

15
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:50,306
like, $3 a month.

16
00:00:50,556 --> 00:00:53,347
-- It's hilariously cheap.
-- Everybody on the show,

17
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:57,157
if you're in Apple, go to privacy.apple.com and if you're in Google, go to

18
00:00:57,263 --> 00:00:57,374
the

19
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,124
search for Google, take out

20
00:00:59,453 --> 00:01:01,254
and go download all your photos

21
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:04,643
because sometimes they get nuked and disappear and

22
00:01:04,774 --> 00:01:07,503
go do that maybe once every year because you

23
00:01:07,513 --> 00:01:09,414
probably will cry if you lose all your photos.

24
00:01:09,424 --> 00:01:13,274
So I found a tool. I don't remember the name of it now.

25
00:01:13,454 --> 00:01:16,363
And it's, oh, it's on my laptop actually. Um, let me, let me look at it.

26
00:01:16,513 --> 00:01:17,594
I will tell you what it is.

27
00:01:17,694 --> 00:01:20,814
Well, you know what I did, which is horrible. I enabled icloud Sync.

28
00:01:21,094 --> 00:01:23,083
And then the trick is you just have to traverse and touch

29
00:01:23,191 --> 00:01:25,481
every file to make sure it actually downloads and then you get

30
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:28,570
about 99.5% of your files and a few just don't come through.

31
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:34,810
Yeah, I, I used to do that. I found a tool called icloud PD, which is

32
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:38,570
it, it says a command line tool to download photos from

33
00:01:38,831 --> 00:01:40,411
icloud or whatever.

34
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:46,250
Anyway, I run this and it downloads my photos into a directory which I then

35
00:01:46,411 --> 00:01:48,990
obviously store and back up appropriately.

36
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:54,339
And I've never downloaded my backup thing from Apple.

37
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:57,059
I did get the one from Google more than once.

38
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,059
But yes,

39
00:01:58,069 --> 00:02:04,309
losing all of my photos due to like Apple deciding I'm a bad person terrifies me.

40
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:06,379
-- Just a
-- little glitch. We fix the problem.

41
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,489
That's true.

42
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,300
Also, I've never had that particular thing happen to me,

43
00:02:11,309 --> 00:02:15,514
but I have heard of many people who have their Google or Apple account canceled for,

44
00:02:15,645 --> 00:02:17,315
they claim it's no reason

45
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,264
who knows. I mean, you know how it is.

46
00:02:19,274 --> 00:02:21,785
It's like funny enough your opening was fixing computers.

47
00:02:21,794 --> 00:02:24,875
It's when you go to like your, your uncle calls you. It's like a computer is broken.

48
00:02:24,884 --> 00:02:25,404
It's like,

49
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,264
what'd you do? Nothing.

50
00:02:27,485 --> 00:02:32,054
And like the, the case is bent and hanging open and there's a wire and it's like, yes,

51
00:02:32,065 --> 00:02:34,595
clearly you did nothing to this case.

52
00:02:34,764 --> 00:02:37,434
Well, my favorite is if you did nothing and you weren't using it,

53
00:02:37,445 --> 00:02:38,815
how did you notice it was broken?

54
00:02:38,824 --> 00:02:40,184
And they go, uh,

55
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:43,600
and I'm like, just be like, it's like a priest or a lawyer.

56
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,839
It's like, you know, I just, I need your honesty. So I like your doctor.

57
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,470
I need to know if you have a weird rash somewhere so I

58
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,850
can treat it because if you don't tell me about the weird rash,

59
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,389
your arm might fall off.

60
00:02:54,369 --> 00:02:58,139
Yes. Well, except we're tech people and we

61
00:02:58,505 --> 00:03:02,714
have no legal ramifications for

62
00:03:02,865 --> 00:03:05,815
telling other people the horrible things we learned about you.

63
00:03:05,824 --> 00:03:10,395
Whereas doctors and lawyers do have codes of ethics they have to follow.

64
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:11,955
Well, which funnily enough

65
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,154
-- is today's episode.
-- It kind of is, sadly.

66
00:03:16,369 --> 00:03:17,020
All right.

67
00:03:17,029 --> 00:03:22,059
So I'm going to start us out by reading the title of the register story for

68
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,830
anyone who doesn't know the register is a

69
00:03:23,839 --> 00:03:27,669
new site that will say has sensationalist headlines.

70
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:31,610
-- No, they have British headlines. British.
-- Are they, are they British?

71
00:03:31,619 --> 00:03:32,229
I don't even know

72
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:32,720
the

73
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,770
register.co.uk and then they rebranded to the register.com

74
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,919
a couple of years ago.

75
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:37,440
They have

76
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:42,039
British style of headlines that are very snarky. There's a lot of alliteration.

77
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:44,130
-- They're they're clever.
-- Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

78
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:47,529
-- Well, a little mean, very, I suppose it's very British.
-- Yeah, that's snarky.

79
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:48,630
Snarky is mean

80
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,750
-- a little mean.
-- Ok. So the, the, the title is Sisa Boss

81
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,000
Makers of Insecure software are enablers of the real villains.

82
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,600
Yeah.

83
00:03:57,929 --> 00:03:58,669
Which

84
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,309
-- she's not wrong.
-- I mean,

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,229
I kind of, I, so this article, I,

86
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:11,279
I have not seen the talk that Jen Easterly gave Jen Easterly is the head of CISA

87
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:15,539
and the register captures a handful of things. But kind of the

88
00:04:15,929 --> 00:04:17,750
we'll say summary of it all

89
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,950
is that Jen Easterly is blaming software developers.

90
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,029
No, my understanding was she was blaming the software vendors, the company,

91
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:26,559
the vendor,

92
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,339
the vendor.

93
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,059
That's an important distinction because that's

94
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,265
like you can

95
00:04:30,434 --> 00:04:30,785
like it.

96
00:04:30,795 --> 00:04:32,845
It's the difference between criticizing a person and

97
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,704
saying like the company you work for sucks.

98
00:04:34,904 --> 00:04:35,274
I mean,

99
00:04:35,285 --> 00:04:38,105
that's true because there are lots of people who work for

100
00:04:38,114 --> 00:04:40,424
the phone company and we all hate the phone company,

101
00:04:40,434 --> 00:04:41,714
but we like our neighbors.

102
00:04:41,725 --> 00:04:42,505
Well, hopefully

103
00:04:42,695 --> 00:04:47,024
there are a couple of nuggets in this article that I think are not terrible.

104
00:04:47,035 --> 00:04:50,505
Like for example, she says, stop calling them security vulnerabilities.

105
00:04:50,515 --> 00:04:53,945
I'm OK with that, you know, call them product defects essentially.

106
00:04:53,954 --> 00:04:55,825
And I won't argue with that one.

107
00:04:55,994 --> 00:04:57,809
-- Hey,
-- I mean, I just went through that like

108
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,320
is my engine blowing up a security problem?

109
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:00,559
No,

110
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:04,809
but like enough of these engines are blowing up that there's like a class

111
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,239
action lawsuit website and a process to get your engine swapped out with,

112
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,399
by the way, my car with a new engine.

113
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,369
So, Zippy,

114
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,799
it's a new engine cart. Of course, it is.

115
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:14,369
Like,

116
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:17,239
I've never had a new car with a new engine.

117
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,829
This is a first for me.

118
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,029
-- Right.
-- I'm in my late forties. I've never owned a new car.

119
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:23,869
I still, technically, I've never owned a new,

120
00:05:24,464 --> 00:05:26,975
I have never owned a new car.

121
00:05:26,984 --> 00:05:29,755
I will probably never own a new car because I'm a cheap skate. But,

122
00:05:29,975 --> 00:05:31,964
and like, I've never seen a clean engine.

123
00:05:32,075 --> 00:05:34,554
Well, I mean, my wife's had new cars so like Terra

124
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:37,975
Lee, I have, I guess anyway. Ok. But here's the thing.

125
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:38,535
So

126
00:05:38,654 --> 00:05:42,954
I feel like this article along with a couple of other things c

127
00:05:43,105 --> 00:05:46,174
has been doing lately is a cause for concern.

128
00:05:46,184 --> 00:05:51,850
And I think that Cisa is starting to take a stance of just security,

129
00:05:51,859 --> 00:05:54,869
harder nerds for solving some of this.

130
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,649
And I don't like that because it's kind of like, I don't, I don't know what to call it,

131
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,260
but I, the thing in my brain is like, reverse victim shaming,

132
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:08,070
right where? Instead of blaming the users, which thank goodness they're not,

133
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,410
they're saying, oh no, no.

134
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:13,959
The problem is lazy vendors and like the vendors could do more and we'll put,

135
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,309
could do more in quotes.

136
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,589
But I think it's more complicated than just blaming vendors.

137
00:06:18,665 --> 00:06:22,734
Well, it kind of ignores like the market realities of

138
00:06:22,894 --> 00:06:24,964
company A spends a million dollars on security.

139
00:06:24,975 --> 00:06:29,174
Company B spends a million dollars on new features and sales. Which company wins.

140
00:06:29,184 --> 00:06:32,295
-- Well, statistically, company B,
-- right, of course. I mean, Bruce Schneier

141
00:06:32,545 --> 00:06:36,154
had an article he wrote about this, what he called it, the security market for lemons

142
00:06:36,635 --> 00:06:42,364
that was decades ago, which is that famous economics paper about, you know, the,

143
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:46,950
-- the, the market for lemons where
-- you mean like cars that have engines blow up.

144
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:47,440
But how do you

145
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:47,720
know?

146
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,329
I mean, no, no, no, no, no, that's not what this is.

147
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:54,209
So what, what the the the I'll explain for anyone listening.

148
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:58,420
This was a, an economist, I believe that wrote this paper and they were,

149
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,859
they specifically focused on used cars

150
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:01,899
where

151
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:06,369
when you are the seller of a car like, you know, in theory, you know,

152
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,700
everything wrong with your car and as a buyer,

153
00:07:09,859 --> 00:07:13,260
they are at a disadvantage. So let's say, for example, you have,

154
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:18,320
I am a car owner. Kurt is a car owner. I have never taken care of my car at all.

155
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:23,910
I barely changed the oil like the tires are pretty much bald. The car is in shambles.

156
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,369
Kurt on the other hand,

157
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,649
has meticulously changed his oil and taking care of everything you can

158
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,549
take care of on the car and it is in marvelous shape,

159
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:33,450
but from the outside, they look the same.

160
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:37,980
Now, if both of those cars are sitting on a lot.

161
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:42,140
In theory, my car should be priced low and Kurt's car should be priced high,

162
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:47,070
but that isn't how it works because the car sellers basically pick

163
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:50,670
like the midpoint and they will sell both cars for the same price

164
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,709
knowing that the buyer has no idea.

165
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,010
And I'm, I'm probably screwing this up. So I apologize to anyone who understands.

166
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:57,570
Well, no, no, no.

167
00:07:57,579 --> 00:08:00,089
That, that also goes to information asymmetry,

168
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,260
which is especially a problem in real estate, for example of like

169
00:08:03,903 --> 00:08:05,252
end up with noisy neighbors.

170
00:08:05,442 --> 00:08:05,912
Sure.

171
00:08:05,972 --> 00:08:08,282
The the point is that like the,

172
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:13,963
the the car dealership buying the used cars is not going to give ding me

173
00:08:13,972 --> 00:08:18,403
necessarily in price and they're also not going to give Kurt a a higher price,

174
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:21,553
they're going to give us like this middle of the ground average.

175
00:08:21,683 --> 00:08:23,972
-- Well,
-- the Kelly blue book value or whatever, right?

176
00:08:23,983 --> 00:08:24,963
And that's kind of what

177
00:08:25,075 --> 00:08:25,415
it,

178
00:08:25,425 --> 00:08:28,256
it came down to and security is the same way where

179
00:08:28,265 --> 00:08:31,895
if you do good security versus someone who does bad security,

180
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:33,455
it's still going to be like the middle

181
00:08:33,466 --> 00:08:37,035
of the road price that wins because fundamentally

182
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:42,565
the buyers don't have enough information to correctly interpret what is

183
00:08:42,575 --> 00:08:46,116
-- going on with these products
-- or they straight up don't care.

184
00:08:46,989 --> 00:08:50,359
No, I don't like that either. I don't think that's a good attitude.

185
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:54,109
-- So
-- I for example, have bought several cars in the past and I have never

186
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,880
consciously cared about the quality of the engine.

187
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,840
I've never checked to see if there were recalls on that car and model

188
00:08:59,969 --> 00:09:01,400
and I will do so from now on

189
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:05,479
because I've learned the hard way that there are cars that have been mass produced,

190
00:09:05,489 --> 00:09:08,682
been around for 10 years that have engines that randomly blow up.

191
00:09:08,692 --> 00:09:12,153
Even if you do oil changes and take care of it correctly.

192
00:09:12,283 --> 00:09:15,482
Would that information have existed when you bought your car though? Yes.

193
00:09:15,572 --> 00:09:20,153
The lawsuit that, yeah, that happened years ago and that's the thing is,

194
00:09:20,163 --> 00:09:23,872
it's not that I didn't care in a sense of I was malicious or lazy or dumb.

195
00:09:23,882 --> 00:09:25,583
It's, I didn't know I had to care.

196
00:09:25,593 --> 00:09:28,703
I just sort of assumed if you're buying a proper brand name car,

197
00:09:28,806 --> 00:09:32,366
like, if I was buying a Trabant, I would expect the engine to blow up because, like,

198
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:36,546
-- it was made in East Germany 40 years ago,
-- which is an awesome car, by the way.

199
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:37,026
Right.

200
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:40,776
Yeah, it's, I love that they can't be recycled because they're, the,

201
00:09:40,786 --> 00:09:43,296
the body panels are made from recycled materials.

202
00:09:43,306 --> 00:09:46,926
It was industrial cotton waste and oil and it was pressed into a form of plastic.

203
00:09:47,046 --> 00:09:47,625
And so it's,

204
00:09:47,846 --> 00:09:49,565
you can't recycle it, like you can just

205
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:52,580
-- chip it. Yeah. I'm like, they're super
-- weird.

206
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,210
If anyone ever goes to Berlin, you can drive the Treant.

207
00:09:55,549 --> 00:09:58,619
They have like a tourist trap thing and I've done it before. It is

208
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:01,099
the most amazing car I've ever driven

209
00:10:01,219 --> 00:10:05,190
-- for all of the wrong reasons.
-- I've seen an angry, uh, a person who owned a Trevan

210
00:10:05,409 --> 00:10:08,840
and she was angry and she accidentally ripped the door handle off because she was,

211
00:10:08,849 --> 00:10:09,250
like, open

212
00:10:09,494 --> 00:10:10,575
it so angrily.

213
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:14,775
Ok. Anyway, I, I want, I want to get us back on the, on the path of security.

214
00:10:14,784 --> 00:10:15,854
-- That's the thing
-- is like, I,

215
00:10:15,864 --> 00:10:19,484
it's not that I didn't know or I didn't know I had to care because I assumed, hey,

216
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,515
these are like this is brand name software.

217
00:10:21,525 --> 00:10:23,934
-- It should be safe,
-- right? I want to

218
00:10:24,164 --> 00:10:28,494
separate that term. I think. So when you say they don't care

219
00:10:29,469 --> 00:10:35,710
in my mind, I interpret, don't care is I know better, but I am actively choosing

220
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,450
the known bad thing for some other reason.

221
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:44,349
Be it price or my friend is selling it or whatever, right? Versus, I don't know.

222
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:48,270
-- Yeah.
-- No, this is, this is more of a rum smelled, unknown, unknowns.

223
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,309
Like another thing I've learned from driving different cars in the last month.

224
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,630
My Kia optima is the best car

225
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,190
for cup holders because they're the same size in the front and back.

226
00:10:56,664 --> 00:10:58,455
So my water bottle fits in the front and back.

227
00:10:58,744 --> 00:10:59,645
The Kia sport,

228
00:10:59,854 --> 00:11:04,094
the Toyota Camry and the Toyota Rav four have smaller cup holders in the back.

229
00:11:04,104 --> 00:11:05,815
My water bottle does not fit in them

230
00:11:06,114 --> 00:11:09,135
-- so
-- just don't sit in the back, aren't you driving?

231
00:11:09,265 --> 00:11:11,734
Well, my kids would like to drink some water maybe anyways.

232
00:11:11,744 --> 00:11:15,534
But like again, I never cared about cup holders in a car because it,

233
00:11:15,544 --> 00:11:19,434
like I've only ever apparently owned cars that have all of the same size cup holders,

234
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,655
-- which is apparently
-- ok.

235
00:11:20,664 --> 00:11:22,405
We're done talking about cars.

236
00:11:22,534 --> 00:11:23,474
No more cars.

237
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:28,789
I want to put us on the path of security and we're going to discuss security. Right.

238
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:33,830
So Sisa is taking this attitude that I'm going to call blaming the vendors

239
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,159
and I think it is

240
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:39,390
not completely incorrect. However,

241
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:45,789
I think this is one of those examples where vendors have virtually no regulation,

242
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:49,979
the tooling that exists is terrible and unsafe. We keep using it.

243
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,710
We have no incentive.

244
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:53,369
I mean, you're talking about market forces,

245
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,280
we have no incentive from the market to do things correctly.

246
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,609
We have minimal incentive from the governments to do things correctly.

247
00:11:59,760 --> 00:11:59,979
The

248
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:03,625
investment in safe and reliable tooling is abysmal at

249
00:12:03,635 --> 00:12:06,265
best and it feels like every single metric we

250
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:08,655
could have to point us in the right direction

251
00:12:08,664 --> 00:12:11,575
has been like purposely pointed in the bad direction.

252
00:12:11,585 --> 00:12:12,815
That's what I feel like here.

253
00:12:12,825 --> 00:12:16,234
Well, I think it's also worse than that is, will this be effective?

254
00:12:16,244 --> 00:12:19,135
And so a great example is writing secure tooling,

255
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,265
I think sadly,

256
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:24,294
will not be as effective as people hope because you still have to get people to use it.

257
00:12:24,465 --> 00:12:25,695
And that's not

258
00:12:26,164 --> 00:12:26,380
a small

259
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,270
-- cost
-- that is not.

260
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,260
And rust is the example right now, right,

261
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:36,340
where like no one's gonna switch to rust and we don't expect them to, but the point is

262
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,770
it exists

263
00:12:37,969 --> 00:12:42,210
and there's so many other places like we just don't even have, you can say like, oh,

264
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,890
writing a secured alternative won't work.

265
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,450
Well, no, it doesn't exist.

266
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,880
But if it did, yes, it's not a silver bullet, but it's definitely

267
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:53,905
-- step one of a three 100 step journey.
-- Well, I think,

268
00:12:54,085 --> 00:12:55,184
like,

269
00:12:55,195 --> 00:13:00,505
I care less about security than I used to and I care more about process improvement,

270
00:13:00,515 --> 00:13:01,994
I think would be the best way to put it.

271
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,544
I mean, I think that's a reasonable statement.

272
00:13:04,554 --> 00:13:09,114
I feel like when we got into this space, it was all about like fix a vulnerability,

273
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,044
release, an update.

274
00:13:10,054 --> 00:13:10,765
Like that's it.

275
00:13:10,965 --> 00:13:13,315
And there's still a lot of places where that happens,

276
00:13:13,515 --> 00:13:15,905
but it's also becoming more apparent that like

277
00:13:16,354 --> 00:13:18,224
this stuff doesn't exist

278
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:22,770
kind of in, in a granular fashion. It's part of a larger system

279
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,809
and the larger system and the process with that system,

280
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,349
it's all very related and it all matters a ton.

281
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,229
Yeah,

282
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:34,739
I, I have a, I have a suspicion that security is an emergent property,

283
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,590
not kind of its own thing,

284
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,869
I expect that's true. And

285
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,919
uh so going to this, for example, the other thing I kind of wonder about is, well,

286
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:45,659
let's assume c is correct, right.

287
00:13:45,669 --> 00:13:47,659
Let's just assume is what they're saying,

288
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,780
going to be effective or helpful.

289
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:50,500
No,

290
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,260
no,

291
00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:52,619
I have a great example.

292
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:56,580
So there's a document I'm staring at from them that this one like wound me up to no end.

293
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,570
It's a, a secure design alert, which is a thing they have. Oh What now

294
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,700
Cisa has these things. They call them

295
00:14:03,952 --> 00:14:05,731
your design alerts where they

296
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:08,062
whatever they, they have their secure

297
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,831
their pledge where everyone like pinky Swor is stop being insecure,

298
00:14:11,841 --> 00:14:12,791
which totally works.

299
00:14:14,372 --> 00:14:17,552
Anyway. This one is called eliminating cross state scripting vulnerabilities.

300
00:14:17,952 --> 00:14:22,211
And they give like zero actionable advice inside of this thing.

301
00:14:22,221 --> 00:14:24,091
It's just totally actionable review. Their

302
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:25,192
models,

303
00:14:25,581 --> 00:14:29,323
ensure software validates input for both structures and meaning

304
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,323
they solve turing

305
00:14:31,734 --> 00:14:33,643
that. Yes, good job, good job.

306
00:14:34,093 --> 00:14:35,364
They solved it because

307
00:14:35,494 --> 00:14:38,133
I'm sorry, uh use modern web frameworks, OK?

308
00:14:38,223 --> 00:14:41,164
In fairness that actually should be emboldened at the top.

309
00:14:41,174 --> 00:14:43,633
-- That
-- should be, that's the only thing you can do today.

310
00:14:43,643 --> 00:14:45,484
And even with modern web frameworks,

311
00:14:45,494 --> 00:14:48,244
there's still plenty of room that you can make dumb mistakes.

312
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,083
But yes,

313
00:14:49,273 --> 00:14:51,864
-- they
-- also say you should conduct code reviews and so hit that

314
00:14:51,874 --> 00:14:54,435
yes button because we're all fatigue and want to go for lunch.

315
00:14:54,445 --> 00:14:55,515
LGTM.

316
00:14:55,806 --> 00:14:56,065
And,

317
00:14:56,075 --> 00:14:57,255
and this is my favorite and

318
00:14:57,265 --> 00:14:59,556
implement aggressive adversarial product testing to ensure

319
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,895
the quality and security of the code throughout the development life cycle.

320
00:15:02,406 --> 00:15:07,276
Sure, I'll just magic up a bag of money to pay for that. It's very easy, also

321
00:15:07,435 --> 00:15:12,476
the expertise to do that. Sure, I it's very common like there's totally not

322
00:15:12,726 --> 00:15:16,205
everybody with the ability to do this working already. For the pent testing firms.

323
00:15:16,486 --> 00:15:17,455
Yeah, exactly.

324
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,179
I

325
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:19,710
mean, but this is

326
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,890
this is the problem, right? This is the advice we get from

327
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:27,549
-- security people
-- secure by design principles to follow.

328
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:31,479
Sounds reasonable principle one, take ownership of customer security outcomes.

329
00:15:31,489 --> 00:15:31,719
Uh

330
00:15:31,969 --> 00:15:32,719
No,

331
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,809
I'm not taking all my customers liability.

332
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,820
Uh Number two, embrace radical transparency and accountability.

333
00:15:37,989 --> 00:15:40,770
Uh Pretty sure my lawyers are at this point screaming uh

334
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,450
three build organizational structure and leadership to achieve these goals.

335
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,679
I don't think that's gonna happen.

336
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:50,434
So the the radical change transparency is really if you read the text, it just says

337
00:15:50,565 --> 00:15:55,145
-- use CV ES basically like issue CV ES for your product.
-- Yeah, that's

338
00:15:55,494 --> 00:15:58,825
HP for example, straight up said we have products with automatic updates.

339
00:15:58,835 --> 00:16:00,544
So there's not going to be any CV

340
00:16:00,554 --> 00:16:02,664
S for them anymore because there's nothing actionable for

341
00:16:02,674 --> 00:16:05,005
the customer to do and they're not technically wrong

342
00:16:05,015 --> 00:16:06,645
because CV S are meant to be actionable.

343
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:10,715
You, you do something with them. Well, if automatic updates are your only choice

344
00:16:10,934 --> 00:16:13,554
and they happen, whether you like it or not, there's nothing actionable anymore.

345
00:16:13,565 --> 00:16:15,554
That is true. And a lot of

346
00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:17,409
products are

347
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,090
SAS

348
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:21,169
and if you have a SAS product and it has cross site scripting,

349
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:21,969
we fixed it

350
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,630
there. Well, there may or may not be, I mean it, you might need to check your,

351
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,270
your data or something. But

352
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,109
well

353
00:16:28,369 --> 00:16:29,479
as a concrete example,

354
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,380
Microsoft said they will do cloud vulnerability

355
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,400
CV S for vulnerabilities where the customer needs

356
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:37,830
to take an action such as using a newer version of the service or,

357
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,309
you know, retroactively

358
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,349
changing some configuration variable, whatever blah blah blah.

359
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,229
So

360
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,010
yeah, no, this whole thing is

361
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:50,940
uh in theory and principle, yes, but in practice, this isn't going to happen.

362
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:52,020
No, it's not.

363
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:52,349
And,

364
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:55,830
and so here's kind of my big takeaway from all of

365
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,739
this stuff that I because SISA also has this thing.

366
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:02,109
I put a link in the notes. Let me click it. So I get it. Exactly correct.

367
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:03,460
Uh It

368
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,060
is the secure by design pledge.

369
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,630
What an idiotic thing? I mean, come on.

370
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:15,698
No, you know what if you can't hold someone accountable,

371
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:19,409
making up this stupid pledge and saying, oh, I'm everyone's signing this pledge.

372
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:20,538
Like come on, that's

373
00:17:22,058 --> 00:17:22,078
it.

374
00:17:22,198 --> 00:17:23,019
-- If it was.
-- Oh,

375
00:17:23,368 --> 00:17:28,405
that's true. Oh, it says pledge signers, check out our group list of pledge signers,

376
00:17:28,805 --> 00:17:32,324
215 companies. Good job. Everyone. You fixed security. I mean,

377
00:17:32,535 --> 00:17:36,084
so this is the thing like you are a freaking government agency.

378
00:17:36,094 --> 00:17:40,604
Your job is to advise the government

379
00:17:40,734 --> 00:17:42,324
on policy

380
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:47,430
that can have like real change. This is where we need compliance.

381
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:48,949
We need things that have teeth.

382
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:49,750
Now you could say, oh,

383
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,079
we can't have security compliance because we don't have the

384
00:17:52,089 --> 00:17:55,270
security tools or the know how great invest in that.

385
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,189
Like, again,

386
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:59,750
part of your job is to make sure that we're actually doing the

387
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,520
research and we're understanding the problems and

388
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:05,729
we're creating viable solutions to this.

389
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:06,819
Instead,

390
00:18:06,829 --> 00:18:11,229
we have these stupid alerts and these dumb pledges that have zero

391
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:14,319
meaning to the real world and it's infuriating like come on,

392
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:15,619
do your freaking job.

393
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:19,020
Um I actually am not clear what is the secure by design

394
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,819
pledge that you're signing up to because they say take the pledge today

395
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,780
if you're an enterprise software manufacturer and would like to join the pledge,

396
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:25,699
please email us.

397
00:18:25,989 --> 00:18:28,729
-- Like, what, what
-- if you scroll down?

398
00:18:28,739 --> 00:18:30,800
It says pledge goals and I'm not even going to

399
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,719
go through them because they're stupid and it doesn't matter.

400
00:18:32,729 --> 00:18:35,650
-- No.
-- But that's, that's pledge goals. That's not the pledge itself.

401
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,209
Like what I'm saying is they're saying the Secure by design pledge,

402
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,510
what is it that these companies have actually agreed to?

403
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,650
-- Because that is not at all clear to me.
-- I assume the pledge goals.

404
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:47,329
-- It doesn't matter who cares. It's meaningless. That's the thing.
-- Right.

405
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:49,239
Well, that's what I'm saying. It's worse than that.

406
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,329
It's, I don't even know what these companies have signed up to.

407
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,630
They probably don't either.

408
00:18:54,329 --> 00:18:55,459
And, and here's the thing,

409
00:18:55,579 --> 00:18:59,859
I just took a pledge that I'm going to be secure if I don't do any of these things.

410
00:18:59,869 --> 00:19:00,719
What happens to me?

411
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,140
Yeah. Nothing

412
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,540
again. Like

413
00:19:03,689 --> 00:19:03,699
uh

414
00:19:04,339 --> 00:19:05,680
all the goals are ok.

415
00:19:05,689 --> 00:19:06,900
So goal within one year of signing the

416
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,959
pledge demonstrate transparency and vulnerability of burning.

417
00:19:08,969 --> 00:19:11,060
Ok. So this is what they're actually signing up to. Ok?

418
00:19:11,069 --> 00:19:12,459
Because this is not super clear.

419
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,920
No, it whatever. It doesn't matter. The point is

420
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:20,420
the job of Cisa should not be this fluffy crap. That doesn't matter.

421
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:23,719
The job of Cissa should not be to say the vendors are the bad guys.

422
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:27,489
Like we need real and concrete things that can be done.

423
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:30,459
-- I have an example actually, I want, I want to tell us
-- story actually,

424
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:31,219
simple question.

425
00:19:31,229 --> 00:19:33,459
why isn't the security pledge a regulatory

426
00:19:33,469 --> 00:19:36,060
-- requirement because
-- they don't have that ability,

427
00:19:36,069 --> 00:19:38,910
the regulatory requirements have to come from another organization.

428
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,420
Sisa doesn't have that power

429
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:43,199
like you have to involve nist and lawmakers and things like that,

430
00:19:43,209 --> 00:19:44,339
but like freaking do it.

431
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:45,540
You know what I mean?

432
00:19:46,209 --> 00:19:50,380
CIA should be telling us you need to call your lawmakers and we

433
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:53,180
need you to put pressure on them so these things can happen.

434
00:19:53,189 --> 00:19:55,300
Now, granted a lot of companies might be like, yeah,

435
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,209
we're going to lobby against that because we totally

436
00:19:57,219 --> 00:19:58,349
don't want to have to care about it.

437
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:58,959
Security

438
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:01,119
and yeah, like lots of companies have done that.

439
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:05,300
Who cares your job is to do what needs to be done?

440
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,160
I actually have a minor success story there.

441
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,859
Uh Remember we were talking a few days ago

442
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:11,500
about and I was bringing up the NASA railroad safety

443
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:15,280
-- thing that they run, which is still like an
-- insane to me. But

444
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:15,739
yes.

445
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,729
Well, anyways,

446
00:20:16,739 --> 00:20:19,319
the point is uh many train companies had pledged

447
00:20:19,329 --> 00:20:21,199
to join after a series of disasters and,

448
00:20:21,209 --> 00:20:21,390
and,

449
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:26,979
but actually a bunch of them did join in March of 2023.

450
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:30,099
And there has been some positive results and some of it's

451
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:34,030
like they actually have a, a PDF of success stories which I sent you a link to,

452
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,770
for example, some of the success stories are quite small like, oh, there was a,

453
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,339
a sign and an obstruction on the sign.

454
00:20:38,349 --> 00:20:39,989
So we moved the obstruction so that now the train

455
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,469
drivers can see the sign and slow down and,

456
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,709
you know, there, there was a lot of very

457
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:47,109
small or sometimes subtle process improvements but like,

458
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:50,469
if that prevents one train from, like, going off the rails and smashing stuff

459
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,979
that will totally pay for the project.

460
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,569
-- Absolutely.
-- For a decade.

461
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,250
Right. Yeah.

462
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:59,069
And trains are an example of, like, horrific and expensive accidents for sure.

463
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:02,579
Yeah. Well, or where they burnt like a town down.

464
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:05,569
Like my, uh, I can't pronounce it. The, the one in Quebec.

465
00:21:05,709 --> 00:21:08,660
-- Well, it's happened many places,
-- unfortunately.

466
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,800
I mean, I feel like this pledge is nice but I feel like, yeah,

467
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,329
wouldn't sis's effort maybe be better spent

468
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:16,489
making this more concrete.

469
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:21,180
I, I agree. I agree completely. I think celebrating wins

470
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:25,530
is one of the ways to do this and to show people there can be positive movement.

471
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,900
There are little things can matter,

472
00:21:27,109 --> 00:21:30,270
like little things can matter. And I think we lose sight of that.

473
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:35,989
A lot where we obsess over, we have to remove all cross site scripting flaws. Like

474
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,560
you're not, it's not gonna happen.

475
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:39,709
We don't have the technology or they know how to do that.

476
00:21:39,719 --> 00:21:41,339
Well, and this gets exactly to where I,

477
00:21:41,454 --> 00:21:43,714
I don't care as much about security. I care more.

478
00:21:43,795 --> 00:21:47,035
Are you doing process improvement as a consistent thing like

479
00:21:47,204 --> 00:21:48,145
Kaizen in Japan?

480
00:21:48,535 --> 00:21:51,194
And if you are cool then you're probably headed in the right direction,

481
00:21:51,614 --> 00:21:54,155
right? And, and so this is actually one of the things

482
00:21:54,275 --> 00:21:55,334
SISA has done

483
00:21:55,685 --> 00:21:57,314
is there is a standard from

484
00:21:57,454 --> 00:21:57,675
nn

485
00:21:57,885 --> 00:22:01,275
the secure software development framework. It's NIST 800-2 18

486
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,140
and

487
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:06,439
SISA created a portal and they created a questionnaire.

488
00:22:06,449 --> 00:22:10,339
So obviously, anytime you have a ni standard, it's very long and complicated and,

489
00:22:10,349 --> 00:22:11,459
and how to

490
00:22:11,739 --> 00:22:14,540
show your, your compliant is difficult

491
00:22:14,739 --> 00:22:16,459
and Sisa created a form,

492
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:20,459
it's you fill it out and you basically say like these are the things I am doing

493
00:22:20,729 --> 00:22:23,959
and then we uh you attach your evidence obviously showing like yes,

494
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:27,060
I'm doing the thing and it's all self at a station at the moment,

495
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:30,300
but they created this website and they're collecting these forms

496
00:22:30,855 --> 00:22:34,105
and then government agencies can go and find the forms on.

497
00:22:34,115 --> 00:22:37,485
This is a website like that is a concrete thing that

498
00:22:37,495 --> 00:22:40,745
granted you can argue it has no more teeth than,

499
00:22:40,755 --> 00:22:42,046
than the the pledge.

500
00:22:42,056 --> 00:22:43,625
No, there's a big difference in the,

501
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:46,875
in the pledge. They're saying we will do this

502
00:22:47,176 --> 00:22:48,706
and in the nist and

503
00:22:49,225 --> 00:22:53,796
showcase, they're saying we have done this from a, like from a judge's point of view.

504
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:57,635
That's one that's like, oh, you, you lied about trying to do it, don't do that.

505
00:22:57,645 --> 00:22:59,046
Versus you told the government

506
00:22:59,192 --> 00:23:02,031
-- you did this, did you do this on,
-- on their form?

507
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:04,192
You have to sign it and it's very clear about like,

508
00:23:04,202 --> 00:23:07,261
this is a government document you are signing and a testing

509
00:23:07,401 --> 00:23:10,832
and I think I'm lying to the government is illegal.

510
00:23:11,192 --> 00:23:11,871
It's fraud.

511
00:23:12,082 --> 00:23:13,251
Yeah, I I don't think anyone

512
00:23:13,362 --> 00:23:15,312
I suspect no one's going to go to jail over

513
00:23:15,322 --> 00:23:18,612
the SSDF but like it definitely carries slightly more teeth.

514
00:23:18,621 --> 00:23:20,432
And the point is the more important part of

515
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:24,031
this I think is SISA is collecting these documents.

516
00:23:24,161 --> 00:23:27,712
And I think this is an example of collect a whole bunch of data

517
00:23:28,118 --> 00:23:31,417
and now you can analyze the data and you can make decisions on the data.

518
00:23:31,427 --> 00:23:35,748
Like that is important because you know what, when I submit my form to CISA,

519
00:23:35,988 --> 00:23:40,297
I include all the evidence that shows how I am meeting a particular control.

520
00:23:40,307 --> 00:23:43,738
Now the government could look at it and be like this is ridiculous.

521
00:23:43,748 --> 00:23:46,458
You are not meeting the control by doing this thing, right? And

522
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,208
in my particular instance,

523
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,777
I hope that's not the case because I actually put a lot of work into this.

524
00:23:50,787 --> 00:23:51,858
But you know what I mean? Like

525
00:23:52,017 --> 00:23:54,527
this is the kind of stuff you can do.

526
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:54,887
Well,

527
00:23:54,897 --> 00:23:56,644
I've actually done this type of work in the

528
00:23:56,654 --> 00:23:58,144
last few weeks with all of our star entries.

529
00:23:58,154 --> 00:24:00,833
I was looking at just a hair over 1000 star entries is

530
00:24:01,014 --> 00:24:04,093
-- star.
-- Oh, sorry Security Trust Automation Registry.

531
00:24:04,104 --> 00:24:06,563
And it basically is based on the, the consensus.

532
00:24:06,693 --> 00:24:10,093
-- It's a cloud security alliance thing
-- assessment initiative questionnaire,

533
00:24:10,104 --> 00:24:10,563
right?

534
00:24:10,573 --> 00:24:14,884
And it's things like, you know, do you like, do you automate code deployment?

535
00:24:15,014 --> 00:24:15,683
Yes or no.

536
00:24:15,823 --> 00:24:18,563
Do you, you know, blah, blah, blah, a whole bunch of stuff.

537
00:24:18,573 --> 00:24:22,004
And what's fascinating is the vast majority of these questions are about

538
00:24:22,203 --> 00:24:24,203
99% of people say yes to them.

539
00:24:24,614 --> 00:24:26,109
And there are some interesting

540
00:24:26,219 --> 00:24:28,229
exceptions because for example, the,

541
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:33,079
do you do like a yearly test of your business continuity disaster and recovery plan

542
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:35,729
and guess what? The percentage of people who say yes to that is,

543
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:39,790
-- is
-- it i it's probably really high, I suspect no, you have to guess

544
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:43,560
if I was going to guess I'd guess 80% say yes. No.

545
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:46,770
Really? I'm impressed. They're not lying about 50.

546
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:51,050
I mean, 50 is 50 is what I would expect the actual number to be.

547
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:53,829
But I would assume a lot of people just say yes because

548
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:57,760
I've talked to people who do these questionnaires in the, in the past because like,

549
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:00,339
obviously we get a lot of them from big companies that are like,

550
00:25:00,349 --> 00:25:01,969
please fill out this horrible form.

551
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,650
And what's really nice is the, the CS a cake.

552
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:07,719
I have one of those. I'll often be like, here's my cake.

553
00:25:07,729 --> 00:25:09,310
They're like, oh, close enough. Never mind.

554
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:11,979
Ignore this horrible questionnaire I sent you. But anyway,

555
00:25:12,199 --> 00:25:15,780
a lot of them said it is often that you will catch,

556
00:25:15,869 --> 00:25:19,939
especially smaller companies just like egregiously lying on these forms.

557
00:25:19,949 --> 00:25:20,119
Well,

558
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:21,540
they say yes to everything and that's a good

559
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,969
-- sign that they're
-- lying and that's just it.

560
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:25,979
They're like, if all the answers are yes, we think you're lying.

561
00:25:25,989 --> 00:25:27,410
-- And I'm like, oh,
-- well,

562
00:25:27,689 --> 00:25:29,709
yeah, because like a great example is I was,

563
00:25:29,719 --> 00:25:33,239
I was looking at a couple of large entries, uh Amazon, for example, like,

564
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,130
I think we would all agree.

565
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,989
Amazon has a large mature security

566
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,239
mess,

567
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:38,150
right?

568
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,630
Well, they make their own silicon.

569
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,390
But anyways, their cake entry has quite a few nose

570
00:25:42,589 --> 00:25:44,839
because technically they don't do it.

571
00:25:44,849 --> 00:25:47,640
They provide a service that does it for the customers to do it.

572
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,520
So they themselves like a lot of stuff around encryption keys. They're like,

573
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:51,380
oh, no,

574
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:54,369
we don't technically kind of make sure your data is encrypted

575
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,680
at restaurant transit that's up to the customer to do.

576
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,900
And obviously they make it very easy and even the default in most cases,

577
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,380
but like they don't force it.

578
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,280
Right. So they can't say yes to it.

579
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:06,989
And, and so they're very honest and forthright, which is quite wonderful.

580
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,719
So, so looking at this, one of the biggest again, my takeaway from this is,

581
00:26:10,729 --> 00:26:15,380
it's less about the security answers and more about the maturity of,

582
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:18,040
did they say, do they have a bunch of nos and

583
00:26:18,329 --> 00:26:20,959
hopefully good explanations for why those are nos.

584
00:26:20,969 --> 00:26:24,709
Like my favorite for some of them is like, do you do secure code practices, blah,

585
00:26:24,719 --> 00:26:25,150
blah, blah.

586
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,550
And their answer is like, no, because we don't do that.

587
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,680
Like, we don't do secure coding stuff, you know,

588
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:32,680
we're like some kind of weird niche service that that's not an issue.

589
00:26:33,469 --> 00:26:37,170
And so coming back to this whole CISA thing, I think if we're going to

590
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,569
chastise someone like ah here's what I'm gonna say,

591
00:26:40,579 --> 00:26:42,390
it has to be constructive criticism.

592
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,130
I think that's basically my my summary of this whole show.

593
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,239
-- I mean,
-- I mean, I'm I'm OK with that

594
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:51,250
but I think more importantly than constructive criticism is you need,

595
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:54,810
you need like actionable real examples of things to do.

596
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:58,290
I disagree because that's not always possible because sometimes we don't

597
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,890
-- know yet like we
-- we and when we don't know,

598
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,910
say we don't know,

599
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:03,010
right? Like

600
00:27:03,199 --> 00:27:07,040
that is it for example, this this whole cross a scripting thing, right?

601
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,390
The actionable guidance is to

602
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,229
use a web framework,

603
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,790
right? Which

604
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:15,650
I think we can all kind of agree with.

605
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,650
But there's more than that, it's not just use a web framework, right?

606
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:22,750
There's which web frameworks like it would be lovely if Sisa had

607
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,500
a document that says

608
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,859
if you're using these web frameworks.

609
00:27:26,869 --> 00:27:30,890
Here are some best practices to avoid cross site scripting vulnerabilities.

610
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,020
Well,

611
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:36,890
here's a silly question is why has there never been a vendor or a service or a list of

612
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,859
here is a list of frameworks that are not great

613
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:43,739
and here are better replacements that are maybe ideally dropping

614
00:27:43,849 --> 00:27:44,829
replacements even.

615
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:46,680
And that you should move to like essentially,

616
00:27:46,689 --> 00:27:49,829
here's a list of software that is known to be kind of not great or bad.

617
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:51,260
-- And here's the better
-- solution.

618
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,130
I don't know that for web frameworks and I promise

619
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,670
-- you none of them are drop in replacements
-- well,

620
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,400
or maybe not necessarily drop in replacements but close enough.

621
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,520
So like a good example would be Apache and Engen

622
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,430
-- X.
-- Those are not web frameworks,

623
00:28:03,439 --> 00:28:04,869
not a drop in replacement,

624
00:28:05,069 --> 00:28:09,829
but there is a tool to convert your Apache config to Engen X reasonably correctly.

625
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:13,430
I would say changing web frameworks would be like saying

626
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,800
-- you should switch from Python to
-- Pearl. Yes.

627
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:21,079
But in some cases, that's the only answer because like using this one web framework,

628
00:28:21,089 --> 00:28:25,760
it's so bad and so insecure and so poorly maintained that, that it can't,

629
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,270
it's like it's like the whole C versus rust argument, right?

630
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:28,640
We, we,

631
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:33,319
I think we finally learned and most people are not willing to admit it yet out loud,

632
00:28:33,329 --> 00:28:33,709
but

633
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:36,750
some of us are and that is you can't secure C,

634
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:37,290
-- you
-- can't

635
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:38,199
secure

636
00:28:38,369 --> 00:28:39,160
arguments

637
00:28:40,109 --> 00:28:41,040
against

638
00:28:41,689 --> 00:28:44,729
that, that particular talking point. It's so much fun.

639
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:45,380
Yeah.

640
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,189
But anyway, but here's the point.

641
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:52,069
So then Cisa should be investing in the research to figure out, like, let's

642
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,099
investigate web frameworks.

643
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:58,869
Let's figure out which ones are good or bad or in between or whatever, like,

644
00:28:59,109 --> 00:29:01,969
yeah, no one's doing that because who's going to fund that?

645
00:29:01,979 --> 00:29:05,709
-- That's not exciting
-- work and be vendor neutral and not, you know,

646
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:07,619
have referral links to get money.

647
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:10,520
Right. And that's the thing. like there's a lot of ignoring the technical

648
00:29:10,694 --> 00:29:14,484
that and switching costs, there's a lot of greenfields projects of like, well, what

649
00:29:14,665 --> 00:29:15,625
should I pick?

650
00:29:16,185 --> 00:29:17,964
-- It's hard, it's very hard.
-- Yes.

651
00:29:18,185 --> 00:29:21,844
When I pick a web server, I usually pick Apache because I know how to configure it,

652
00:29:22,214 --> 00:29:24,255
I should probably make the switch to inject at

653
00:29:24,454 --> 00:29:25,454
some point. But

654
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:28,104
most people don't even use web servers anymore, man.

655
00:29:28,114 --> 00:29:31,444
Like when you're using, say for example, your web framework with N PM,

656
00:29:31,535 --> 00:29:33,564
it's standing up a web server and then you're

657
00:29:33,574 --> 00:29:34,974
just supposed to put something in front of it,

658
00:29:34,984 --> 00:29:35,964
some sort of proxy

659
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,150
like, yeah, the world is so different and

660
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:43,290
and but here's the thing, right is let's talk about like web frameworks,

661
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,280
analyzing web frameworks are a great example.

662
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:49,130
Web frameworks were like super exciting and hot like a decade ago, right?

663
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,089
Because it was kind of a new and interesting thing.

664
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:54,300
No one talks about them anymore because there's a ton of them and you just,

665
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,165
it it's, it's not exciting Right.

666
00:29:56,535 --> 00:30:01,964
Security is, I think one of the most notorious industries for chasing shiny objects

667
00:30:02,334 --> 00:30:06,285
where the stuff we actually need to do is super boring

668
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,525
and you are going to get VC money to do it.

669
00:30:08,694 --> 00:30:11,165
That's the reality. Something like rust

670
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:12,484
is boring

671
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:13,530
and

672
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:16,430
no venture capitalist is going to fund

673
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,180
like rust development.

674
00:30:18,189 --> 00:30:19,239
This is where we like,

675
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:23,880
we literally need organizations like Cisa and the sovereign tech fund to fund this

676
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:26,790
stuff because it is boring and no one wants to pay for it,

677
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:26,930
right?

678
00:30:26,939 --> 00:30:27,569
This is like

679
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:32,000
this is like fixing the roads, fixing roads is boring, right?

680
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:35,770
No one is key notting a conference about fixing roads, well,

681
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,699
-- maybe a road conference,
-- but I have a perfect example.

682
00:30:38,709 --> 00:30:40,119
I literally just had

683
00:30:40,303 --> 00:30:43,654
we we just had an STF call where we discussed the choices,

684
00:30:43,663 --> 00:30:46,524
the rankings of the current crop projects for funding

685
00:30:46,894 --> 00:30:49,514
and one of the projects that was most popular,

686
00:30:49,673 --> 00:30:53,994
one of the things they want to do is document what's in the developers' heads so that

687
00:30:54,364 --> 00:30:55,923
they can bring no so that they can

688
00:30:57,014 --> 00:30:57,053
I

689
00:30:57,163 --> 00:30:57,254
get

690
00:30:57,413 --> 00:30:57,484
it

691
00:30:57,774 --> 00:30:58,413
but they

692
00:30:58,624 --> 00:31:03,364
-- so that they can on board new people to the project.
-- I get that 100%.

693
00:31:03,374 --> 00:31:07,604
And I'm like, I was so excited when I read that because I'm like this,

694
00:31:07,937 --> 00:31:11,598
this is exactly this is a sustainable long like

695
00:31:11,608 --> 00:31:13,488
this is something that spending some money on.

696
00:31:14,317 --> 00:31:17,838
Oh my God, the return on investment of this will be easily a factor of one.

697
00:31:18,697 --> 00:31:22,807
But now the venture capital world would only fund that if you're building a device to

698
00:31:22,817 --> 00:31:26,767
extract the brain from the developers and then turn it into an A I model,

699
00:31:26,777 --> 00:31:28,807
-- you know, with,
-- with copyright

700
00:31:28,947 --> 00:31:31,708
-- obviously. Yes.
-- But yeah, but that's the thing, right?

701
00:31:31,718 --> 00:31:33,868
There's, and that's, and I keep coming back to this sort of kai

702
00:31:33,968 --> 00:31:35,008
and constant improvement of

703
00:31:35,112 --> 00:31:39,182
small stuff like looking at that railroads uh uh success report.

704
00:31:39,192 --> 00:31:40,812
Like it was a lot of stuff like

705
00:31:41,072 --> 00:31:44,072
we put up an extra sign so that when they were in a construction zone,

706
00:31:44,082 --> 00:31:46,362
they knew that they had to maintain a low speed, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

707
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,011
like it's small,

708
00:31:48,021 --> 00:31:50,212
but like you do enough of this and you don't

709
00:31:50,222 --> 00:31:52,281
have a train going off the rails at some point.

710
00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:57,612
That's just it, right? Like, like 1000 little things turn into a really big thing.

711
00:31:57,802 --> 00:31:58,131
Yeah.

712
00:31:58,312 --> 00:32:01,812
And eventually you don't even realize it. But suddenly you've changed the world

713
00:32:02,645 --> 00:32:04,676
aspect too is by doing all these little things,

714
00:32:04,686 --> 00:32:08,436
it reduces the noise and the kind of constant alarm, fatigue and stressors.

715
00:32:08,536 --> 00:32:11,495
And you actually now have space and time to focus on the big things.

716
00:32:11,615 --> 00:32:11,706
You

717
00:32:12,385 --> 00:32:15,946
start to have strategic discussions because you can't have a strategic

718
00:32:15,956 --> 00:32:18,456
discussion when the fire alarm is going off every 10 minutes

719
00:32:18,865 --> 00:32:23,495
and security is nothing but fire alarms, like fire, fire after fire after fire.

720
00:32:23,505 --> 00:32:25,515
Like, well, I just, this fire is

721
00:32:25,656 --> 00:32:29,776
good enough. I'm going to the next one now. You know, it's not, they're never put out.

722
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,300
Yeah, it's small ring but probably won't catch.

723
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,750
Hopefully.

724
00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:36,839
No, I know. And so anyway, I, I guess

725
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,089
we need to, we need to close this one out.

726
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:43,280
But, like, fundamentally, I think at the end of the day, all of this stuff, like

727
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:44,319
the job of SISA,

728
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:49,489
I think functionally at this point is we, we lay the foundation,

729
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,969
we need a foundation for doing all of this work.

730
00:32:51,979 --> 00:32:52,650
And I think

731
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,609
a lot of the things I'm seeing

732
00:32:54,849 --> 00:32:59,449
is chasing the shiny and that's not it. Like we need boring foundation work.

733
00:32:59,459 --> 00:33:02,270
That is what we need more than anything in this space.

734
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,810
The one concern I have is this might kind of evolve, be all that they're capable of,

735
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:08,780
they might not be able to do long term

736
00:33:08,985 --> 00:33:11,176
projects. They might, I, I don't know. Right.

737
00:33:11,186 --> 00:33:13,995
I'm just spitballing but based on what they're doing,

738
00:33:14,005 --> 00:33:16,296
I assume that's kind of what they're capable of doing.

739
00:33:16,306 --> 00:33:16,895
And

740
00:33:17,046 --> 00:33:19,776
-- that worries me.
-- I mean, it's certainly plausible.

741
00:33:19,906 --> 00:33:23,975
I feel like though I've yet to see them talk about the fact that we need to

742
00:33:23,985 --> 00:33:26,375
lay the foundation and I feel like they get

743
00:33:26,385 --> 00:33:30,686
a very shiny object chasing mentality is what?

744
00:33:30,696 --> 00:33:32,336
And, and maybe there's some foundation

745
00:33:32,442 --> 00:33:34,251
work going on that I don't know about.

746
00:33:34,261 --> 00:33:34,552
Well,

747
00:33:34,562 --> 00:33:36,302
it might also be they're doing that because that's what

748
00:33:36,312 --> 00:33:38,562
-- most of the market seems to want
-- that very well.

749
00:33:38,572 --> 00:33:39,862
Could be too like you're right.

750
00:33:39,871 --> 00:33:43,942
The market wants security people making bold ridiculous statements

751
00:33:44,161 --> 00:33:47,921
with nothing backing it up and it gets lots of press,

752
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:50,881
which is traditionally the security market

753
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:53,421
anyway. Ok. Here's my happy thought.

754
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:55,901
I don't want to end on this note because I feel like I feel defeated.

755
00:33:56,199 --> 00:33:58,189
The happy thought is go look at what the

756
00:33:58,199 --> 00:34:00,099
sovereign tech fund is doing because holy crap,

757
00:34:00,109 --> 00:34:01,719
I think they've cracked the code like

758
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:04,979
they're doing the boring, amazing work we need to do.

759
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:08,100
I'm also gonna give people a hint and it's not a hidden hint.

760
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,728
It's actually on their application form,

761
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:12,739
but you need to be focusing on sustainability and

762
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:15,620
making sure there's a lot of projects that seem to think

763
00:34:15,629 --> 00:34:17,978
they want to get stf funding on it ongoing basis.

764
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,100
And that's not the point of this.

765
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:23,760
The point of this is to help people grow and stand up on their own.

766
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:24,478
All right,

767
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,679
I'm calling it. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you for listening.
