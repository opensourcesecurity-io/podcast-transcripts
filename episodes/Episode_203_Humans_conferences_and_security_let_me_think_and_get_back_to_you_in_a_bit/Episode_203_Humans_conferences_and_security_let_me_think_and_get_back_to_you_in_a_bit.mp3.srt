Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:11,119
Kurt Siefried and my partner in the Rock Crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,590
So, what's new and exciting? Not much, actually. Well,

3
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:17,409
-- there's plenty new and exciting in the world.
-- I mean, the world,

4
00:00:17,909 --> 00:00:21,690
like, literally there's a new CBC podcast called World on Fire.

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,420
And I just looked at him. I like, yeah, I don't, I don't need to listen to this.

6
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,079
-- I already know what it is.
-- You know, I kind of agree with that.

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,625
I, I stopped watching the, so in the mornings I used to make my coffee

8
00:00:31,764 --> 00:00:35,884
and then go turn on the local news and, like, sit there and half listen to the news,

9
00:00:35,895 --> 00:00:38,034
half read my newspaper and I've quit turning on the

10
00:00:38,044 --> 00:00:40,694
news because it's just everything is such a tire fire.

11
00:00:40,705 --> 00:00:43,075
At least with the newspaper I can hit next on the

12
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:46,025
stories that I don't want to read and it's just,

13
00:00:46,044 --> 00:00:46,654
oh, man.

14
00:00:46,674 --> 00:00:49,145
Yeah, it's, it's hard being a human

15
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:50,450
today

16
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:53,590
and that's related to what we're going to talk

17
00:00:53,599 --> 00:00:56,830
about as well as just the world in general.

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,139
Yeah.

19
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,259
And I think most of us also have, like, enough weirdness going on in our lives with,

20
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:00,549
you know,

21
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,029
like just schedule disruptions and life disruptions like it,

22
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,019
you know, I love this whole,

23
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:10,540
oh, so this is what work from home is like. No, no, I've done this for 22 years.

24
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:15,720
-- Work from home is nothing like this.
-- It has been really hard to concentrate.

25
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,720
-- The
-- first
-- 21.5 years were ok. Then the last five months have been rough.

26
00:01:19,889 --> 00:01:22,720
It's, it's been bananas for sure. And

27
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:23,349
it's,

28
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,949
it's always wild talking to people who have never

29
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,809
worked from home before and don't even like it.

30
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:29,190
Which

31
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,930
in my brain, I think, how could you not like it like that. But

32
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,360
at the same time

33
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,720
they're totally not working from home.

34
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,419
-- Well,
-- I mean, if this is your experience of working from home. Yeah.

35
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,410
-- No, I'm sorry, you're totally fair to hate this.
-- Yeah.

36
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,750
Yeah. Seriously. Anyway, anyway, humans insecurity.

37
00:01:45,669 --> 00:01:46,589
I was going to

38
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:48,015
the show.

39
00:01:48,026 --> 00:01:50,475
So, one of the things I was thinking about is so,

40
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:53,986
Kurt sends me a link to Schneier's blog

41
00:01:54,195 --> 00:01:56,305
and there's what, what is it, the

42
00:01:56,475 --> 00:01:58,195
security and human behavior,

43
00:01:58,636 --> 00:02:00,966
security and human behavior is what it's about.

44
00:02:00,975 --> 00:02:03,276
And it's a really interesting concept and it's something,

45
00:02:03,286 --> 00:02:05,676
actually ironically I wrote a blog post about

46
00:02:05,685 --> 00:02:07,865
unknowingly that this was going to be our topic

47
00:02:08,115 --> 00:02:10,326
that is published now, you know,

48
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,421
link to it. It's about, I, I, what did I call it? The Ineffective

49
00:02:13,962 --> 00:02:16,522
ciso? Maybe it's, it's Clickbait title. But anyway,

50
00:02:16,632 --> 00:02:19,621
you know what I kept thinking of before we last night.

51
00:02:19,632 --> 00:02:20,992
Well, I was, I was kind of, you know,

52
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:23,082
doing some research and everything for this episode

53
00:02:23,091 --> 00:02:25,822
was if I could retitled this podcast,

54
00:02:25,832 --> 00:02:28,141
which I would never do it just because it's too much work,

55
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:31,141
I would call it security philosophy, I think,

56
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,302
because I think that more accurately describes what we do then

57
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:37,009
than actually open source security,

58
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,589
which is our background.

59
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:42,619
But I feel like as security practitioners with the podcast,

60
00:02:42,809 --> 00:02:47,690
we are definitely more philosophy than security. I think in most of these episodes.

61
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:48,710
Well, I mean, we lucked out.

62
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,240
Well, we didn't luck out, but we, we lucked out and that we chose open sources are,

63
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,330
you know, which, which is what one fundamentally.

64
00:02:54,339 --> 00:02:57,279
-- So we got lucky there, Survivor
-- Bias, I knew it would win.

65
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:01,330
Well, hey, 20 years ago, man, that was not, that was not a clear outcome.

66
00:03:01,339 --> 00:03:02,970
No, it kind of wasn't actually.

67
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:03,330
And you know,

68
00:03:03,339 --> 00:03:05,250
that would be a fun show some time just to

69
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:08,009
talk about some of the crazy stories from the past.

70
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:08,279
You wonder,

71
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,429
I just installed visual studio code

72
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:15,169
and then looked at it and realized I also have visual studio already installed.

73
00:03:15,179 --> 00:03:16,570
And I'm like, when did I do that?

74
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:22,270
Like I've literally at some point installed Microsoft development tools because

75
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:24,240
I guess I was investigating them and forgot about it.

76
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:29,000
-- And it's like, I guess Microsoft isn't the baddies anymore. They
-- run on Linux,

77
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:33,580
man. I mean, if you would have told me 20 years ago, visual studio would run on Linux.

78
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:37,839
I would have punched you in the face. Like I'd have been like, you're an idiot.

79
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,399
You have no idea what you're talking about.

80
00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:42,990
Yeah. For your, for your own good and the good of the species we need to put you down.

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,070
That's right. That's right. You're an idiot. And,

82
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,869
yeah. Anyway, anyway, that's a topic for another day today.

83
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,690
We're going to talk about security and human behavior,

84
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:55,750
which I think is a super fascinating topic because one of the things, I guess,

85
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:59,225
ironically, well, a couple of things I always think about here is

86
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:00,884
you've got on one side,

87
00:04:01,255 --> 00:04:02,964
people are people and

88
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,735
they're going to do people things

89
00:04:06,014 --> 00:04:10,164
and then there's kind of this side of security where we'll tell people things like,

90
00:04:10,175 --> 00:04:13,505
-- oh, don't click links and don't open on suspicious emails and
-- don't,

91
00:04:13,514 --> 00:04:14,615
don't click links

92
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:17,720
that you don't trust. So somehow you're supposed to click

93
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:21,858
and know what they are and where they go, even though we all use URL shortener now.

94
00:04:21,869 --> 00:04:25,160
Yeah, it's a lot of our advice is insane.

95
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:28,959
And we also often fail to just account for the fact

96
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,750
that people are people and they're going to do people things.

97
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,549
I don't even, I don't even know where I want to start with this one.

98
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:38,290
-- I
-- think the problem is it's so complicated because it's not just one question.

99
00:04:38,299 --> 00:04:42,029
It's multiple questions. It's like a human can be fully security trained.

100
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,359
But there is a big difference

101
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:48,950
in a person between, they had eight hours of sleep and they had three hours of sleep.

102
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,989
There are differences.

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,399
They've done studies with parole boards and, you know,

104
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,049
you better be getting your parole hearing right after lunch, not before lunch,

105
00:04:56,059 --> 00:04:57,570
but after lunch before.

106
00:04:57,579 --> 00:05:00,589
Right, they're, you know, they've done all these studies with, you know,

107
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,109
how humans make decisions.

108
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:03,089
I've read into this a lot.

109
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,390
I remember one time the company I worked for one was talking about, hey, you know,

110
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,670
we need 24 7 coverage.

111
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:09,856
So we're going to like, make people work different shifts.

112
00:05:09,867 --> 00:05:11,687
You'll work a bunch of day shifts and then a bunch of night shifts.

113
00:05:11,696 --> 00:05:13,277
And my response is no, I'll quit.

114
00:05:13,307 --> 00:05:15,536
And what was really interesting is I looked up

115
00:05:15,546 --> 00:05:17,937
a whole bunch of studies and information on this

116
00:05:18,087 --> 00:05:20,437
to basically prove what a terrible idea this was.

117
00:05:20,536 --> 00:05:24,057
And one fascinating study was from the first Gulf War. So fighter pilots, right?

118
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:29,046
Fighter pilots need to basically go out and fly planes up all sorts of random times.

119
00:05:29,057 --> 00:05:29,427
Right.

120
00:05:29,606 --> 00:05:31,897
So, to help them with this, they give them drugs, you know,

121
00:05:32,134 --> 00:05:35,394
and downers uppers to stimulate them and, you know, get going and downers

122
00:05:35,623 --> 00:05:37,303
when they come back, they can crash and get some sleep.

123
00:05:37,313 --> 00:05:40,394
And what was most interesting to me was the young pilots were taking

124
00:05:40,403 --> 00:05:44,174
the uppers and the older pilots generally tended to take the sedatives,

125
00:05:44,183 --> 00:05:46,473
the downers to get, you know, more rest.

126
00:05:46,484 --> 00:05:51,003
So, even a truly professionally, like these guys cost millions of dollars to train.

127
00:05:51,093 --> 00:05:52,683
And what was amazing to me is they had no

128
00:05:52,824 --> 00:05:56,071
specific sort of doctrine or strategy for how to handle, you know,

129
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,330
medication to keep them awake.

130
00:05:57,341 --> 00:06:00,170
-- It was kind of left up to the pilot.
-- I mean, that doesn't surprise me

131
00:06:00,281 --> 00:06:03,050
-- and it kind of makes sense because everybody's different. Right.
-- Right. Right.

132
00:06:03,061 --> 00:06:06,401
-- Right.
-- All these human things, you know? Ok.

133
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:07,121
So let's do this.

134
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:11,131
-- Let's start with Schneer and what he did
-- quick back story.

135
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,401
-- If you don't know who Sneer is, he wrote a book called,
-- everyone knows who Schneer

136
00:06:14,621 --> 00:06:17,341
-- is, who's listening to this podcast.
-- I bet you a dollar.

137
00:06:17,351 --> 00:06:18,670
Somebody listening to this show doesn't

138
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:23,010
because honestly applied cryptography has kind of been out of sight for a long time.

139
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,670
That's true. And it's even considered harmful in some places.

140
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:28,070
But it's still a cool book.

141
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:33,600
I would actively agree that it is now harmful, but 10 years ago it was 10,

142
00:06:33,609 --> 00:06:34,549
but the world changed.

143
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:35,859
When did, when did it come out,

144
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:36,369
uh,

145
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,070
ages ago?

146
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,399
But I, I would say more to the point,

147
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:43,040
like crypto matured to the point now where you just, you use the cream, rub it on.

148
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:45,869
That's it. Just use it as, as specified on the tube,

149
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,024
make up your own cream.

150
00:06:47,345 --> 00:06:48,875
So he wrote applied cryptography.

151
00:06:48,885 --> 00:06:51,644
I don't remember if there's ever, I think there was a second volume, sort of ish,

152
00:06:51,654 --> 00:06:52,125
but not really.

153
00:06:52,135 --> 00:06:54,904
But anyways, he basically has become one of the, I guess,

154
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:58,385
grandfathers of information security, kind of the wise old man.

155
00:06:58,714 --> 00:07:03,864
-- Yeah, we could, I'll buy that.
-- He's done a lot of thoughtful pieces.

156
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,864
He's, he's done a lot of,

157
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,695
I don't want to call it high level work but it's sort of

158
00:07:07,704 --> 00:07:09,765
that really high level strategic where

159
00:07:09,774 --> 00:07:12,625
there's nothing you can really actually specifically

160
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,079
immediately do with it, but you really should be reading it.

161
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,540
Yeah, I'll agree with that.

162
00:07:17,549 --> 00:07:20,440
So, yeah, one of the things he's done is the security and human behavior conference,

163
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,420
which I, that's now in its 12th year.

164
00:07:22,429 --> 00:07:25,779
Like I was looking at that and I'm like, man, this, we've been around for a while.

165
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,070
It's invite only

166
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,269
and, and in all seriousness, I think Schneier

167
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,820
was talking about human behavior

168
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,359
before most of us cared.

169
00:07:35,369 --> 00:07:35,890
Well,

170
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:38,184
I feel like a lot of technologists get stuck in the

171
00:07:38,195 --> 00:07:41,804
trap of trying to solve all problems with the same hammer,

172
00:07:41,815 --> 00:07:43,454
the same technological hammer, right?

173
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:47,804
Like I've had so many people ask, how do I prevent X where X is?

174
00:07:47,815 --> 00:07:50,285
Much more of a social problem than a technical problem.

175
00:07:50,295 --> 00:07:53,445
Like people ask me how I secure my kids computers and I'm like, well simple.

176
00:07:53,454 --> 00:07:55,875
It's up against the wall in the living room, in a public space.

177
00:07:55,885 --> 00:07:57,674
Like they, you know, it's just high

178
00:07:57,994 --> 00:07:58,554
visible

179
00:07:58,734 --> 00:07:59,875
and when he's on it,

180
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,750
you know, like we keep an eye on him.

181
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:03,329
Right.

182
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,519
And that's probably far more effective than any technical

183
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:09,450
measure you can possibly because let's face it.

184
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:10,559
In most families,

185
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:13,850
the kids are smarter than the parents and they're going to get around

186
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:17,899
any sort of lockdown software you try to put on that computer.

187
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:18,290
Well,

188
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:20,829
the number of people I've had where they've tried to

189
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:23,440
lock down their kids' devices specifically so they can't,

190
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,790
like, view too much youtube videos.

191
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:26,380
Like, they only get half an hour an hour or whatever.

192
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,769
And the number of interesting and weird workarounds kids have found. It's amazing.

193
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:32,359
Yeah, the security and human behavior thing.

194
00:08:32,369 --> 00:08:37,489
One thing I like about his conference is that it is small and they've structured

195
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,558
apparently so that, like,

196
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,440
everybody gets a few minutes to talk and kind of do their thing.

197
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,299
So there's, it sounds like there's a,

198
00:08:43,308 --> 00:08:46,619
instead of like five or six people talking for an hour,

199
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:50,000
it's several dozen people each getting their five or 10 minutes.

200
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:53,760
-- So you get, it sounds like a lot more cross pollination
-- from what I've gathered.

201
00:08:53,979 --> 00:08:56,799
There's seven minute talks

202
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:02,159
and then people break out and discuss facets of whatever the topic is,

203
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:03,059
which I love that.

204
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,239
That I'm not gonna lie.

205
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,030
When I go to a conference,

206
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:10,989
I'll, I'll go to a handful of talks, but generally speaking, the hallway,

207
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,469
hallway con, as people say is where it's at,

208
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:16,650
I've never enjoyed having someone talk at me for an hour.

209
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:18,830
In fact, I hate, like, I like giving talks.

210
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,150
-- I don't like giving talks for an hour
-- because my favorite

211
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,549
part is always the Q and A at the end,

212
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:25,549
especially when somebody asks a question. I'm like, holy crap.

213
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,859
I totally forgot to cover that or just that to

214
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,150
my mind.

215
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:32,559
Or my favorite thing. I always tell people when I'll start.

216
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:37,059
One of these talks is I love being interrupted and if you can derail me so bad,

217
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,210
we don't finish a slide deck.

218
00:09:38,219 --> 00:09:39,890
I consider that a success.

219
00:09:39,989 --> 00:09:45,020
And like I've, I've done talks before where I make it through two slides and we,

220
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,840
we're off the rails and I love it.

221
00:09:46,849 --> 00:09:47,840
It's marvelous.

222
00:09:47,849 --> 00:09:50,510
-- You want
-- to hear my ideal scenario, a person presents a talk,

223
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,700
they have their slides and they actually send out in

224
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,500
advance the slides with proper notes and an agenda,

225
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,739
but everybody acts,

226
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:00,020
he reads and pays attention to so that you can whip through the slides

227
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,390
in about four minutes and then get to the guts of the discussion.

228
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,080
That would be my ideal scenario in a perfect world.

229
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,700
Never going to happen. I get that.

230
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,390
But, you know, if we had spherical counts, that's what I would want to happen.

231
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,609
Yeah, I could agree with that. I do enjoy the conversations.

232
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:14,590
It's definitely more interesting for sure.

233
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:16,820
-- And
-- this leads to my biggest thing where, you know,

234
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,789
you and I are having that disagreement of whether or not

235
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,049
this sort of stuff is actually conferences in general are useful.

236
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,450
So I would argue

237
00:10:24,979 --> 00:10:28,580
they are not useful for the reason people think they are

238
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:29,719
OK.

239
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:30,510
And

240
00:10:30,739 --> 00:10:33,080
I would say so people envision you go to a conference,

241
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,479
you're going to learn new things and you can then take your knowledge back

242
00:10:36,489 --> 00:10:40,390
to wherever it is you came from and apply it in some meaningful way.

243
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,679
And I'm going to argue that most of the conference content I've seen and even given,

244
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,630
I don't think is particularly useful.

245
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,000
-- I think a lot of the ideas are old and stuffy is
-- the word you want to use is actionable.

246
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:54,950
That's a fair word, I think. And yeah, there's rarely any actionable items.

247
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,945
A lot of this stuff is just thinly veiled

248
00:10:56,955 --> 00:10:59,776
sales pitches for wherever somebody happens to be working.

249
00:10:59,786 --> 00:11:03,255
And I find them frustrating and it's very flat.

250
00:11:03,265 --> 00:11:07,015
I would, I was actually listening to Russell Brand's podcast the other day,

251
00:11:07,026 --> 00:11:09,375
he had Conan o'brien on which was a marvelous episode.

252
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:14,495
And the thing Conan o'brien, he, how he described fame is a flavorless broth.

253
00:11:14,635 --> 00:11:17,676
And I think that's what a lot of these conference talks feel like because it's,

254
00:11:17,685 --> 00:11:19,356
it's like a flavorless broth.

255
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:23,711
-- You, you, you can consume it, but there's no sustenance in it
-- to actually,

256
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:26,642
I would agree generally with what you're saying. But I would add to that.

257
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:30,252
I think on the Dunning Kruger Curve, I remember every year going to RSA and, you know,

258
00:11:30,262 --> 00:11:33,091
these people would be giving new talks on new attacks and I'm like, no,

259
00:11:33,101 --> 00:11:34,752
I already heard about that, like, months ago.

260
00:11:34,841 --> 00:11:38,752
My favorite is when the same people give the same talks every year on the same thing.

261
00:11:38,762 --> 00:11:40,992
And it's like, this is insanity.

262
00:11:41,002 --> 00:11:41,442
Well, I mean,

263
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:44,111
I'm talking about actually new stuff but I was working

264
00:11:44,122 --> 00:11:46,911
for security information vendors at the time where it's like,

265
00:11:46,921 --> 00:11:46,942
yeah.

266
00:11:46,952 --> 00:11:50,081
no, we, we were told about that because we were part of the effort to deal with this.

267
00:11:50,469 --> 00:11:51,580
And then it's like, oh, yeah. Right.

268
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:54,750
I'm not, I'm not having to fix printers or servers. Right.

269
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,070
I'm in the information security industry side of this,

270
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,700
not the actually making it work side industry.

271
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:03,309
And so one thing that I always have to keep in mind is for a lot of people,

272
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,260
this stuff is new.

273
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,789
A great example, you know, hands up who here

274
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:12,119
-- knows what Excel pivot tables are.
-- You can't say hands up on a podcast. Yeah.

275
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:15,609
Anyways point is how many people use Excel or a spreadsheet at

276
00:12:15,619 --> 00:12:18,239
least once or twice in their life and have no idea.

277
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,799
Pivot tables exist. Cool.

278
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:23,010
But how many people use Excel, like on a weekly or daily basis and don't know,

279
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,080
-- pivot tables exist
-- probably lots.

280
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:29,280
I know what they are. I basically can't ever get them to work. So I don't care.

281
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:32,815
But the point is they're this hugely useful, easy to use. Tool.

282
00:12:32,825 --> 00:12:33,575
Like literally,

283
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:35,875
you just need to spend 10 minutes on youtube watching

284
00:12:35,885 --> 00:12:38,176
a tutorial video and you can start using them.

285
00:12:38,185 --> 00:12:40,556
-- I've spent more than 10 minutes and I still can't figure
-- them

286
00:12:40,565 --> 00:12:41,116
-- out.
-- Ok.

287
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,955
Well, in Google Sheets, they have a walk through example that makes it really easy.

288
00:12:43,966 --> 00:12:47,526
Like it literally helps you select your data anyways. I tried it. I couldn't do it.

289
00:12:47,536 --> 00:12:47,926
Ok.

290
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:48,866
Well, I literally, the last,

291
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,356
I literally set this up yesterday and I had

292
00:12:50,366 --> 00:12:51,875
to re watch the tutorial because I forgot how,

293
00:12:51,885 --> 00:12:52,736
and it took me three minutes.

294
00:12:52,745 --> 00:12:55,736
But the point is it's this hugely useful tool

295
00:12:55,812 --> 00:12:57,671
and it's not even that most people don't know

296
00:12:57,812 --> 00:13:00,992
how to use it. It's that most people don't even know it exists.

297
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:04,671
And that's one of the things I do find useful for these conferences.

298
00:13:04,682 --> 00:13:05,642
Like a great example.

299
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:08,651
Remember when I Ds and IP S was new and people were literally like,

300
00:13:08,661 --> 00:13:11,151
it blew their mind like they, you know, wait,

301
00:13:11,262 --> 00:13:15,512
I, OK. So I know what a firewall is and I can block incoming data to arbitrary ports.

302
00:13:15,521 --> 00:13:19,911
Cool. Wait, you're saying I can like, actually filter for content and sort of

303
00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:23,549
the bad stuff and let the good stuff through, you know what I mean?

304
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:26,070
And that was at one point that was new and again,

305
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,090
I bet you there's still people out there that don't really have

306
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,609
a good cognition of what this is and what it can do.

307
00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:36,150
Yeah. You know, you're probably not wrong. I'm spinning this in my mind now of

308
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,840
what, what does that mean?

309
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:42,159
So the point is, is just knowing something exists, is a huge step forward,

310
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:46,020
knowing that there is a territory that is marked here, be dragons and going.

311
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:46,280
Huh?

312
00:13:46,609 --> 00:13:47,979
I wonder what is actually there?

313
00:13:47,989 --> 00:13:51,130
Well, and you know, you know, what else you just made me realize is

314
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,239
we were,

315
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,559
we had a conversation before I hit record where I had to remind Kurt that in no way,

316
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,229
are we comparable to normal people?

317
00:13:58,239 --> 00:13:59,750
Because you're talking about dropping laptops

318
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:02,119
and Kurt and I don't drop laptops.

319
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:05,515
Like it's just an unwritten rule will say like, it's just don't do it.

320
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:07,955
Well, it's like people who break their phones and I'm like,

321
00:14:08,294 --> 00:14:09,445
why did you break your phone?

322
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:11,075
We're not getting into.

323
00:14:12,325 --> 00:14:14,114
My point is given

324
00:14:14,364 --> 00:14:17,635
our, our how long we've been in the industry and we have a podcast.

325
00:14:17,645 --> 00:14:19,114
So we obviously consume

326
00:14:19,284 --> 00:14:23,715
vastly more information than I suspect most security people.

327
00:14:23,724 --> 00:14:26,635
And, and let's face it. There are security people that it's a job.

328
00:14:26,645 --> 00:14:27,955
Well, most people are busy

329
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,950
-- making stuff work so their boss doesn't yell at them. Yeah, that
-- too. That too.

330
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,400
And so it's a very different universe I think in that regard.

331
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:40,070
And so I'm spinning this in my brain and I don't think you're wrong in a lot of ways.

332
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,710
I, I always think back like basics there, there's so many basic fundamentals that,

333
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:46,309
where, where do you get them from?

334
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,830
And I think unfortunately, in a lot of cases, conferences might be it,

335
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,270
which is appalling now that I'm thinking about it.

336
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,640
Well, it's not just that it's the,

337
00:14:53,885 --> 00:14:56,145
is having the time and space to actually, like,

338
00:14:56,155 --> 00:14:58,224
breathe and learn something and not be.

339
00:14:58,234 --> 00:15:00,575
I remember once when I was very young, you know,

340
00:15:00,585 --> 00:15:03,265
looking locally for a job and this one place was like,

341
00:15:03,275 --> 00:15:05,494
we expect you to work like 40 or whatever hours a week.

342
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:08,775
And I'm like, cool. And it's like, and we expect you to stay up to date in your own time.

343
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:11,484
And I'm like, well, I do that anyways, but I'm not cool with you.

344
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,434
Kind of expecting me to then

345
00:15:13,604 --> 00:15:18,815
-- do 10 to 20 unpaid hours of work a week.
-- They had a term for this

346
00:15:19,094 --> 00:15:19,544
in,

347
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:21,830
in a company I used to work for,

348
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,799
we called it church time where instead of going to church,

349
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:27,219
you spend that time doing something that is,

350
00:15:27,229 --> 00:15:30,229
your company should be letting you do anyways.

351
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:33,340
It's just the way they structured it and kind of presented it.

352
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,380
I was like, ok, I'm, I do not want to work for you because it was pretty clear,

353
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,130
it was a sweatshop.

354
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,590
But that's the reality where a lot of people work is.

355
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:44,119
They don't have the time and space and support from their leadership

356
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:45,960
to actually get better.

357
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:48,320
I mean, and, and even when you do so, like, in all

358
00:15:48,432 --> 00:15:49,093
seriousness.

359
00:15:49,103 --> 00:15:53,853
I currently work, I work at Elastic and they're very generous with this concept.

360
00:15:53,862 --> 00:15:56,653
We call it space time where we encourage people to take

361
00:15:56,843 --> 00:16:01,333
like a week or two to go and do something that isn't your day to day job.

362
00:16:01,343 --> 00:16:02,333
And it's not really, you know,

363
00:16:02,343 --> 00:16:05,492
it's not vacation either but you go do something else and like,

364
00:16:05,502 --> 00:16:08,692
I'm in a position where I just don't have time for space time,

365
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,973
which is super annoying.

366
00:16:09,982 --> 00:16:11,932
And of course, it's easy to say, oh, just take your time.

367
00:16:11,942 --> 00:16:13,653
But it's like, no, because if I don't do this,

368
00:16:13,703 --> 00:16:16,732
my work is literally going to pile up because I don't have anyone to help,

369
00:16:16,846 --> 00:16:18,486
do some of these tasks right now.

370
00:16:18,495 --> 00:16:21,585
And I mean, one of the goals is like get Josh some help,

371
00:16:21,596 --> 00:16:24,325
but that's also easier said than done in itself.

372
00:16:24,335 --> 00:16:28,885
-- And so I get this, it's
-- the red queen. You have to run just to stay where you are.

373
00:16:28,895 --> 00:16:32,995
Oh, absolutely. 100%. And it's super frustrating because I know I'm doing it.

374
00:16:33,005 --> 00:16:34,606
And funny enough when I was younger,

375
00:16:34,616 --> 00:16:37,445
-- I didn't realize that
-- so many people burn out of infosec

376
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:40,176
because they don't realize that in a lot of infosec,

377
00:16:40,185 --> 00:16:41,565
you have to run to keep up.

378
00:16:41,575 --> 00:16:45,185
And the problem is there are things that you can let fall by the wayside.

379
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,669
But to know what things you can actually let fall by the wayside and

380
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:52,469
not get like fired for requires a high degree of maturity and again,

381
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,929
some support from your leadership.

382
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,799
Right. So anyways back to the actual Shulk

383
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:57,729
topic,

384
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:01,210
I like conferences because

385
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:05,209
I don't want to call them normals because it, people even are not normal, but like,

386
00:17:05,219 --> 00:17:07,930
even for it, people just to know that,

387
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:11,410
you know, products exist or to know that a new strategy exists.

388
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,930
Like how many people basically

389
00:17:14,348 --> 00:17:18,589
know about Blockchain, but actually what they know is a little bit about Bitcoin.

390
00:17:18,598 --> 00:17:20,520
And they think that that's what the Blockchain world is.

391
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:24,770
And when I start telling them what is actually not just possible in Blockchain

392
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:26,910
and distributed ledger technologies,

393
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,180
but what is actually out there in the form of like, things like, you know,

394
00:17:30,189 --> 00:17:32,609
R three or hyper ledger or block one or whatever,

395
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:34,739
like things that are actually shipping where you can, like,

396
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,180
download an SDK and start building things.

397
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:40,199
-- It blows their mind
-- or what they, what they're good for.

398
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:45,449
I mean, I actually, so I had, uh, someone I work with, their daughter was

399
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,099
doing a report on security and she said,

400
00:17:48,207 --> 00:17:50,337
can my daughter, you know, can we have a, like,

401
00:17:50,347 --> 00:17:52,136
I want to take 15 minutes of your time or whatever?

402
00:17:52,146 --> 00:17:53,557
And I said schedule an hour. Trust me.

403
00:17:54,036 --> 00:17:55,746
That's what I said. I said schedule an hour.

404
00:17:55,756 --> 00:17:58,026
She's like, I don't want to take that much time. I'm like, just trust me.

405
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,977
Schedule an hour. All right. Well, we'll take as much time as we need

406
00:18:01,126 --> 00:18:02,697
and, yeah, I took an hour but,

407
00:18:02,817 --> 00:18:05,906
and, and, yeah, at one point the, uh, this lady's daughter was like, you know,

408
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,626
what do you know about, like, Blockchain?

409
00:18:07,636 --> 00:18:11,067
What is this Blockchain stuff? And I said, all right, we don't have a lot of time.

410
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,193
I've got, like, buckle up, I'm going to give it and,

411
00:18:13,244 --> 00:18:15,534
and the thing is at first it was like, oh, magic money, whatever.

412
00:18:15,543 --> 00:18:18,663
I don't get it. But then when I started talking about like lettuce, right?

413
00:18:18,673 --> 00:18:20,193
How, how people are using,

414
00:18:20,203 --> 00:18:24,833
let you know the Blockchain technology to track the lettuce supply chain.

415
00:18:25,154 --> 00:18:28,524
And obviously, then when you have, let's say some sort of incident with,

416
00:18:28,534 --> 00:18:29,384
let's say coli

417
00:18:29,524 --> 00:18:31,624
and lettuce and all of a sudden now you

418
00:18:31,634 --> 00:18:34,014
don't have suppliers that are like just accidentally,

419
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,500
you know, tipping that book into the garbage.

420
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:40,640
And no, we didn't have any lettuce come through here, you know, like, yeah, you did.

421
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:43,921
It's, it's right there anyway. Anyway, II, I do think you're right.

422
00:18:43,931 --> 00:18:48,441
And I think so funny enough, we've, we've transitioned this, this talk from,

423
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:50,520
I guess, human behavior into conferences.

424
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:54,441
But I think that is an interesting point you raise is

425
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,921
they give certain people

426
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,770
and out, I guess almost.

427
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:03,939
But now here is the other side and I think the danger of conferences there are more

428
00:19:03,949 --> 00:19:09,260
people I know than not who don't have budget or time to go to any conferences.

429
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,569
Well, I guess the good news there is a COVID.

430
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:15,790
-- It's all the conferences have a virtual component now
-- they do and

431
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,449
it is different for sure.

432
00:19:18,459 --> 00:19:22,630
But I think even more importantly than COVID I would say has been. Besides

433
00:19:22,989 --> 00:19:23,300
yes,

434
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:26,349
because I found the B size regional

435
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:30,819
conferences are substantially higher quality than anything

436
00:19:30,829 --> 00:19:34,329
I've seen at like Black Hat or Rs A in the last decade.

437
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,709
And it is accessible

438
00:19:36,869 --> 00:19:40,689
-- and fun.
-- I would say Bides has more variation.

439
00:19:40,699 --> 00:19:43,709
The larger conferences tend to be very much a bell curve.

440
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:46,869
-- I think for content quality,
-- I agree with that 100%.

441
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,260
Partly because people are

442
00:19:49,935 --> 00:19:54,435
-- so invested in trying to game the system.
-- They got to play it safe too. Right.

443
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:56,844
You can't bite a chicken's head off on stage

444
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:58,824
but you cannot be

445
00:19:58,925 --> 00:20:00,834
-- sides.
-- You totally could. But not

446
00:20:00,974 --> 00:20:02,594
that Rs A is a machine.

447
00:20:02,655 --> 00:20:06,895
-- They can't afford to make people angry or to lose their sponsors.
-- True.

448
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:10,805
I mean, there's been talks that have been canceled or withheld or like lawyer

449
00:20:11,055 --> 00:20:12,484
stuff got involved and

450
00:20:12,974 --> 00:20:14,515
-- big controversies
-- and

451
00:20:14,734 --> 00:20:15,564
Bides doesn't care.

452
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:16,680
Well, it

453
00:20:16,979 --> 00:20:19,880
-- isn't big enough for anybody to care yet.
-- I don't know.

454
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:20,160
Yeah,

455
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:23,130
I don't know if they ever will be though because I think the whole point is to

456
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,810
keep it regional and if they start getting too

457
00:20:24,819 --> 00:20:27,469
big now make two regions instead of one.

458
00:20:27,489 --> 00:20:29,699
And I think that's part of the challenge too is that, you know,

459
00:20:29,709 --> 00:20:31,979
it's these victims of their own success.

460
00:20:31,989 --> 00:20:33,750
Like locally there's this guy who basically

461
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,319
started putting up Christmas lights in his,

462
00:20:35,329 --> 00:20:35,680
like

463
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,219
on his farm and people started driving by to see it.

464
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,479
And then like 10 years later

465
00:20:39,592 --> 00:20:41,031
guys got like eight C cans,

466
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:44,812
like 40 ft sea cans full of Christmas decorations that he has to put out every year.

467
00:20:44,832 --> 00:20:48,932
And he's like, you know what? Just I, I quit, I'm done here. I get that

468
00:20:49,062 --> 00:20:50,942
and everybody's like, oh, but we love it. We love it.

469
00:20:50,952 --> 00:20:53,491
And he's like, cool, like y'all gonna pay 10 bucks to see it.

470
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:54,482
And of course, everyone is like,

471
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:57,102
you know, but this poor like,

472
00:20:57,302 --> 00:21:01,171
or these music festivals like literally that start out with like, you know,

473
00:21:01,182 --> 00:21:03,092
a couple dozen people and then 1020 years,

474
00:21:03,203 --> 00:21:06,034
it's like, OK, you know, 5000 people show up and like,

475
00:21:06,043 --> 00:21:07,723
we just don't have enough porta potties,

476
00:21:08,004 --> 00:21:11,293
you know, and, and that's kind of what's happened with, well, by definition,

477
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,784
that's what happens with a good conference that runs yearly.

478
00:21:13,793 --> 00:21:15,374
That is a good point.

479
00:21:15,593 --> 00:21:16,504
And of course,

480
00:21:16,754 --> 00:21:18,384
like the security and human behavior,

481
00:21:18,394 --> 00:21:20,343
one looks like they intentionally keep it small,

482
00:21:20,354 --> 00:21:23,624
but most conferences are run as a business and thus

483
00:21:24,014 --> 00:21:26,693
the more the merrier and you know, and, and in fairness.

484
00:21:26,816 --> 00:21:30,355
So I would say something like Rs A one thing I love about Rs A is

485
00:21:30,365 --> 00:21:34,845
wandering around the vendor halls because I see at least five or 10 or 20.

486
00:21:34,855 --> 00:21:35,485
Like just

487
00:21:35,755 --> 00:21:39,715
I'm like, that is what? Oh that's actually really cool.

488
00:21:39,725 --> 00:21:41,676
Like, I've never even considered that

489
00:21:41,895 --> 00:21:45,515
-- and here it is as a product that I can actually buy.
-- No, I, I agree. I agree.

490
00:21:45,526 --> 00:21:50,436
I do, I do love the vendor halls for that. That reason. Of course, it's also amusing

491
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:54,956
because there's always vendors there who clearly have no idea what's going on and

492
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,930
giving them a hard time can be fun.

493
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:58,660
-- There's
-- a lot of wackiness,

494
00:21:58,949 --> 00:21:59,910
I'll still never forget.

495
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:04,459
One of my favorite things ever was, this was back in probably 2002, 2003,

496
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:05,619
going to Linux

497
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:06,380
World.

498
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:10,329
And it was one of the first times Microsoft had a booth there

499
00:22:10,469 --> 00:22:12,689
and walking around. They're like, oh, do you use windows?

500
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:13,819
I'm like, no, I hate you guys.

501
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,579
And,

502
00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:18,239
and they said, well, well, do you actually download the software and edit?

503
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,300
I'm like, yeah, I work for a Linux company, like, oh,

504
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:24,359
well, here's, here's a shirt, like, go away. Like, it was great because they were,

505
00:22:25,189 --> 00:22:28,130
I was not their target audience at that show.

506
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,030
I mean, you know,

507
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,719
that's like communists and capitalists meeting at a World Bank forum.

508
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,689
Like, it's just

509
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,089
not that they're,

510
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:39,000
yeah, it's just, I think that conferences have the one thing too is like,

511
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:42,689
you just to get face to face as king for communication.

512
00:22:42,699 --> 00:22:44,630
Like, I'm sorry, like we can, you know,

513
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,670
I've worked remotely for 22 years so I've learned how to write.

514
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:50,930
Well, and, you know, the phone and reach out to people and, you know,

515
00:22:50,939 --> 00:22:53,760
kind of get up in their stuff so that I can get their attention.

516
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:57,719
But man, face to face wins. It's just so much easier and you get body language.

517
00:22:57,729 --> 00:23:00,449
Oh, absolutely. There's huge advantages to it.

518
00:23:00,459 --> 00:23:00,939
But again,

519
00:23:00,949 --> 00:23:05,310
the most powerful aspect of that even isn't always the meetings you're

520
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:07,819
in during the day or the talks you're going to see.

521
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:11,680
It's, it's who you run into in the hallway and who you have dinner with at night.

522
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,829
Well, it's, I call it the, by the way, right?

523
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:16,469
Because in an email nobody ever types, oh, by the way,

524
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:18,349
we're going to be like burning down the

525
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:20,319
DC tomorrow night because we've got cockroaches,

526
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:20,709
right?

527
00:23:20,719 --> 00:23:22,900
-- But they will say that face to face.
-- Yeah, that's true.

528
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:25,469
And if I ever saw an email that had, oh, and by the way,

529
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:28,420
I would stop reading at that point and just move on because it's like,

530
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,030
I don't even want to know.

531
00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:33,089
Yeah. Whereas that's actually probably the most important critical thing.

532
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:36,449
Oh, by the way, you know, we're moving all the offices to

533
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,369
Mars for tax purposes tomorrow, pack your bags. Right.

534
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:40,949
And I mean,

535
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:42,770
then this is part of the human behavior piece is

536
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,060
just that humans are fickle and complicated and like,

537
00:23:46,069 --> 00:23:49,619
I know my behavior and my kids' behavior changes from day to day.

538
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:53,489
Like, now that school's out, my one kid is kind of stressed and not happy about it.

539
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,300
And we are supposed to treat people like they're sort of this quasi

540
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,689
rational economic actor that actually behaves the same day in and day out.

541
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:00,219
No,

542
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,680
-- that's not how people work.
-- No, I agree.

543
00:24:02,689 --> 00:24:06,959
I agree completely and kind of on that note if you, I'll put a link to it. But

544
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,920
so in Schneier's blog about his conference,

545
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,699
I'm really sad that there isn't more info,

546
00:24:11,709 --> 00:24:14,410
someone did a little bit of kind of live blogging about it,

547
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,969
but it's not nearly as detailed as I would love to see.

548
00:24:16,979 --> 00:24:20,969
It's fascinating, some of these topics and it also fascinated me that

549
00:24:21,189 --> 00:24:24,810
a lot of these were less human focused than I expected as

550
00:24:24,819 --> 00:24:28,025
well where I thought this was going to be very philosophical.

551
00:24:28,035 --> 00:24:30,984
-- It's
-- sort
-- of that human machine interface part that

552
00:24:30,994 --> 00:24:33,385
we get quite terribly wrong most of the time,

553
00:24:33,395 --> 00:24:34,135
like all the time.

554
00:24:34,145 --> 00:24:37,665
So many examples where, you know, clearly the people. Oh, a perfect example.

555
00:24:37,675 --> 00:24:38,185
I'm at IKE

556
00:24:38,305 --> 00:24:39,905
a yesterday trying, you know,

557
00:24:39,915 --> 00:24:42,214
to buy some kitchen cabinets and we order a

558
00:24:42,224 --> 00:24:44,305
custom countertop and she's got to print it out.

559
00:24:44,574 --> 00:24:47,484
And a perfect example is she's scrolling through this list of like over 100

560
00:24:47,494 --> 00:24:50,145
printers trying to find the printer that's like a foot in front of her.

561
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,589
Right? And I'm like, oh, can you set favors?

562
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:53,489
And she's like, yeah, we can,

563
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,910
but they keep changing and they change between the

564
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,520
apps and everything and they don't always stay put.

565
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:59,329
And I'm like, holy crap. You must hate your print setup and everything.

566
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:03,479
She's like, yeah, it's, it's like she literally, it took her two or three minutes

567
00:25:03,719 --> 00:25:05,640
to find the printer she wanted to print to.

568
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:10,530
And like, I was just thinking, like, man, this is something that can be solved.

569
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:14,209
This is a solvable problem. But like, it just hasn't.

570
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:16,719
And, and that's kind of where I come to insecurity. There's

571
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:21,459
if you watch users for like five minutes, like going back to our talk before the show,

572
00:25:21,469 --> 00:25:21,819
like

573
00:25:21,939 --> 00:25:22,609
with laptops

574
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,560
back in the early days, people are like,

575
00:25:24,569 --> 00:25:26,459
why do these laptops keep coming back broken?

576
00:25:26,469 --> 00:25:29,560
What people do to these expensive things? And the answer is they're dropping them.

577
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:33,319
Why? Well, because they're people, people drop stuff on my kids' school.

578
00:25:33,329 --> 00:25:36,140
They have chromebooks and they are taught a specific chromebook

579
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:39,109
hold where you cross your arms in front of you

580
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,920
and you kind of hug the chromebook to your chest.

581
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,739
-- Right?
-- Well, and they would, kids would break them.

582
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:48,770
It reminds me also of when I took science class in my younger days,

583
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:51,410
they taught you how to carry a microscope, right?

584
00:25:51,729 --> 00:25:53,979
Like one hand on the base, nice and tight,

585
00:25:53,989 --> 00:25:56,660
the other hand on the neck and you walk slowly to where you're

586
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:59,839
going because this thing is expensive and we don't want to replace them.

587
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:04,479
I get that here's where I want to end this and this is related

588
00:26:04,489 --> 00:26:07,520
to everything that's going on and it is very human focused and this,

589
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:10,520
it ties back to the IKEA problem of, oh, you can fix this.

590
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:14,310
It's a matter of incentives and this was the focus of that blog post.

591
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:18,140
I wrote of, we often don't have incentives, especially in security.

592
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:21,219
And we think just complaining a lot is an incentive but it's not,

593
00:26:21,229 --> 00:26:23,829
nobody cares if you want to see something fixed.

594
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:26,239
You have to actually have a reason to get it fixed.

595
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,589
-- Well, you have to align the incentives.
-- Well, right, exactly.

596
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:30,349
Just complaining isn't an incentive.

597
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:30,729
I mean,

598
00:26:30,739 --> 00:26:35,750
so kind of the story I like to tell here that I've really kind of kicked it all off was

599
00:26:35,854 --> 00:26:36,675
there was

600
00:26:36,814 --> 00:26:40,385
a thread Mudge put on Twitter where he was basically

601
00:26:40,395 --> 00:26:43,224
complaining about iot security and he's not wrong at all.

602
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:43,474
Sorry.

603
00:26:43,484 --> 00:26:45,604
Every time somebody complains about iot security, I'm like, well,

604
00:26:45,614 --> 00:26:47,275
what did you expect for a $5 like?

605
00:26:47,385 --> 00:26:48,635
And so here's the thing though, right?

606
00:26:48,645 --> 00:26:53,645
Is so the loft and cult of the dead cow and all these people back in the day,

607
00:26:53,744 --> 00:26:56,785
they basically went to the public at large and they

608
00:26:56,795 --> 00:27:00,895
shamed people like Microsoft into effectively caring about security.

609
00:27:01,364 --> 00:27:04,625
And that worked. But that was a different problem. And

610
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:06,959
I think a lot of these people,

611
00:27:06,969 --> 00:27:09,439
they think that bag of tricks still works and

612
00:27:09,449 --> 00:27:12,640
shaming people is basically that that boat is gone.

613
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:15,449
It is sailed and especially in the world of iot

614
00:27:15,729 --> 00:27:18,689
nobody cares. So, you have to think what is the incentive here, right.

615
00:27:18,699 --> 00:27:22,579
Public shaming is no longer a valid incentive. So, what are we going to do next?

616
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:23,920
It's not effective.

617
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,359
It, it's probably, yeah,

618
00:27:26,369 --> 00:27:30,910
and it might have been once and I have a feeling that was the planets aligned

619
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:31,599
and

620
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,319
it happened to work.

621
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:34,369
But,

622
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,469
yeah, like for real,

623
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:38,949
if you want someone to change behavior or you want to fix the system,

624
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,939
there has to be an incentive to do it.

625
00:27:40,949 --> 00:27:43,869
Complaining and yelling at them isn't an incentive.

626
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:44,800
Yep,

627
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:45,800
I would agree.

628
00:27:46,089 --> 00:27:49,640
And I think that's the hard part is especially as security people,

629
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:51,979
we often have misaligned incentives and we don't

630
00:27:51,989 --> 00:27:54,979
understand what makes somebody care about something.

631
00:27:54,989 --> 00:27:55,520
And

632
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:58,920
this is where kind of the point of the blog post I wrote was saying that, you know,

633
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:00,390
you have these csos screaming,

634
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,689
oh I have to report to the CEO and the reality is you're ineffective at your job.

635
00:28:04,699 --> 00:28:05,439
And so the incentive

636
00:28:05,545 --> 00:28:06,564
needs to be the CEO,

637
00:28:06,574 --> 00:28:08,964
yelling at people on your behalf instead of being an

638
00:28:08,974 --> 00:28:11,685
effective communicator and giving people a reason to care.

639
00:28:11,694 --> 00:28:13,364
I just, I keep coming back to the, you know,

640
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:16,525
if you can't sell security to an organization,

641
00:28:16,535 --> 00:28:17,905
maybe you don't actually really need it.

642
00:28:17,915 --> 00:28:18,204
Yeah,

643
00:28:18,214 --> 00:28:21,785
I agree because all these massive organizations have

644
00:28:21,795 --> 00:28:23,964
had massive data breaches and you know,

645
00:28:23,974 --> 00:28:26,564
what life goes on, man, like has anything

646
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:31,209
truly bad or terrible happened as a result of these breaches.

647
00:28:31,219 --> 00:28:33,050
Yeah, there's, everybody had to, like, you know,

648
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,800
pay an extra 10 cents to get their credit cards replaced or whatever.

649
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:37,770
But fundamentally, you know,

650
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:41,489
-- I can't tell
-- sometimes there isn't an incentive and you have to be

651
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,250
-- able to recognize that and say there's no incentive
-- sometimes in life.

652
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,000
How do I put this nicely? Sometimes in life you're going to

653
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,589
step in dog poop

654
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,339
or there's potholes,

655
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,150
potholes are a better example. Potholes are just a thing

656
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,530
and, you know, we'll fill the big ones, but

657
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:59,239
that's it. Just if you want roads, you're going to have to live with potholes.

658
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,780
And if you want it, you're going to have to live with it.

659
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:06,040
-- Security problems
-- to a degree. Yeah, I agree with that. Absolutely.

660
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,500
But now at the same time,

661
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:12,430
you would make the argument that if we're going to use potholes as the analogy,

662
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:13,569
we'll ride this out on

663
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:17,000
-- you like a bridge shouldn't fall down when you go across
-- it.

664
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,800
That's a catastrophic failure. That has a larger impact.

665
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:22,550
-- Whereas a pothole,
-- but if a bridge fell down, people would

666
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,010
care, they tend to notice.

667
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,170
And I think that's part of the challenge we

668
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:29,489
have also is if you claim everything is critical,

669
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:29,930
nothing is,

670
00:29:30,223 --> 00:29:32,633
-- and I think that's part of our problem is
-- alarm fatigue.

671
00:29:32,802 --> 00:29:35,312
-- Yeah,
-- we claim everything is critical. So nothing's critical.

672
00:29:35,322 --> 00:29:38,042
-- So no one listens to us because there's no incentive
-- and that's a challenge too.

673
00:29:38,052 --> 00:29:40,223
Is like, literally, like, my DEV team came to me and they're like, oh,

674
00:29:40,233 --> 00:29:41,432
we need to start tracking cvs.

675
00:29:41,442 --> 00:29:44,353
And I'm like, no, no, you don't. And they're like, who cares? You're the CV guy.

676
00:29:44,363 --> 00:29:45,753
I'm like, yeah. Yeah. Don't,

677
00:29:46,103 --> 00:29:48,542
I'm like, they're like, but what do we do? What do we do?

678
00:29:48,552 --> 00:29:50,312
And I'm like, well, you guys ship an update, like,

679
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:53,215
you guys refresh the software about every week or two.

680
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:56,026
And they're like, yeah, and I'm like, well, and you can push out an emergency update,

681
00:29:56,036 --> 00:29:56,975
what, in about an afternoon?

682
00:29:56,985 --> 00:30:00,015
-- They're like, yeah, and I'm like, ok, keep doing that. Yeah.
-- Right. Exactly.

683
00:30:00,026 --> 00:30:03,056
-- That's way more valuable than tracking this crap.
-- And even better.

684
00:30:03,066 --> 00:30:06,056
I'm like, do you keep all your, you know, your dependencies up to date?

685
00:30:06,066 --> 00:30:08,286
And he's like, well, most of them we have a couple pin because of wonkiness.

686
00:30:08,296 --> 00:30:09,635
I'm like, yeah, cool. Yeah. Right.

687
00:30:09,645 --> 00:30:12,605
Keep an eye on those, like, just keep everything up to date and

688
00:30:12,806 --> 00:30:14,336
keep pushing updates quickly and

689
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:17,260
because, I mean, that's what we're going to do if there's a CV flaw. Right.

690
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,469
He's like, yeah, I'm like, so,

691
00:30:18,579 --> 00:30:18,949
yeah,

692
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,880
don't spend time tracking these things because

693
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:22,979
-- keep it up to date, man. Right.
-- There's,

694
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,550
and it's funny because I,

695
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,130
there,

696
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,199
there's almost a negative incentive to

697
00:30:27,209 --> 00:30:29,209
doing something like tracking individual CV,

698
00:30:29,469 --> 00:30:31,380
-- si
-- get for some people in some situations.

699
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:35,520
-- It matters and it does, but
-- there are instances, but I don't think they're the norm.

700
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,520
Well, and again,

701
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:39,390
part of that maturity piece of knowing when you actually need to do that and not do it.

702
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:41,229
Right. Right. Oh, yeah, definitely.

703
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:43,885
Banks need to make sure all accounts come out to within the penny.

704
00:30:43,895 --> 00:30:46,564
Otherwise maybe there's fraud whereas, you know me,

705
00:30:46,574 --> 00:30:49,905
I like fire up mint and I'm like the pie chart looks roughly correct,

706
00:30:50,295 --> 00:30:53,045
whatever. You know, my kids probably aren't embezzling me.

707
00:30:53,055 --> 00:30:55,545
-- So
-- I will, I will end this show

708
00:30:55,655 --> 00:30:59,035
on, on, I have a story related to what you just talked about. So

709
00:30:59,194 --> 00:31:03,744
I used to use good new cash to track my finances.

710
00:31:03,755 --> 00:31:07,224
Yeah, like it was, I had a set up but I realized at one point

711
00:31:07,334 --> 00:31:09,785
I was spending about four hours a month

712
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:14,430
on, on making sure everything worked out and anytime there's an inconsistency,

713
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,209
I'd have to go back through paperwork and figure out

714
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:20,449
and like 100% of the time it was because I forgot to put something into

715
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:24,859
one of the accounts. And I had many. And so anyway, I finally like, one day, I'm like,

716
00:31:24,979 --> 00:31:26,989
II, I just, I don't want to do this anymore.

717
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,109
I'm,

718
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:29,550
this is driving me insane and it's taking tons and

719
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,209
tons of time and it just kept taking more,

720
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,485
more and more time.

721
00:31:32,495 --> 00:31:34,826
And eventually I was like, I can't do it

722
00:31:35,066 --> 00:31:36,265
and I quit. And that was,

723
00:31:36,406 --> 00:31:39,365
I bet two years ago now it didn't matter.

724
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:42,125
The only thing that's different is I have four hours of my life

725
00:31:42,135 --> 00:31:44,995
back and I'm not stressing out about why the numbers in Gnu cache

726
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:46,286
weren't matching up.

727
00:31:46,296 --> 00:31:49,645
I used to have servers in my house and I got rid of all of them for the same reason.

728
00:31:49,656 --> 00:31:52,166
Like running my own email was pointless. Right.

729
00:31:52,302 --> 00:31:55,802
Sometimes. Just not doing something is vastly more effective.

730
00:31:56,592 --> 00:31:59,842
And that's a perfect example of if it turns out you actually needed to do it,

731
00:31:59,852 --> 00:32:01,482
you can go back in time and do it.

732
00:32:01,511 --> 00:32:07,661
Exactly. I have, I keep the paperwork, I keep it in a file just so someday if I need it,

733
00:32:07,862 --> 00:32:09,001
I can go get it,

734
00:32:09,381 --> 00:32:13,202
but I don't need it and I haven't. So I win anyway.

735
00:32:13,459 --> 00:32:16,319
