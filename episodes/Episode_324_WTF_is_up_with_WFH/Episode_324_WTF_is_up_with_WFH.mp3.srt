Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt Siefried

1
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:13,000
and my partner in working from home for about two decades. Josh Bresser,

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,380
what were you saying?

3
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,000
-- I was distracted by cheese that
-- we've both been

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,110
working from home uh for about two decades,

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,149
for myself since 98.

6
00:00:20,159 --> 00:00:21,780
And I think you were about the same.

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,750
I started working from home in 2000 and four.

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,790
Oh, ok. You're a latecomer to this.

9
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:27,819
Indeed.

10
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,110
Yeah, I love when people, you know, they're like,

11
00:00:31,319 --> 00:00:33,270
essentially the work from home thing comes up.

12
00:00:33,279 --> 00:00:36,549
And I'm like, yeah, I've been doing this since 1998 and they're like, what I'm like.

13
00:00:36,849 --> 00:00:37,630
Yeah, like that.

14
00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:42,240
Basically the people that do what I do have a choice in Canada back in the day,

15
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,250
which is you either move to America or you work remotely that seems fair

16
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,790
there just, there isn't this kind, there wasn't this kind of work in Canada.

17
00:00:50,604 --> 00:00:52,154
Were you working from home? In 1998?

18
00:00:52,165 --> 00:00:56,104
-- Most people had dial up internet in 1998
-- Security portal.com.

19
00:00:56,154 --> 00:00:59,055
I was working, I was contracting for security portal.com

20
00:00:59,194 --> 00:01:02,625
and I had high speed internet. Oh, I see. That's, ah, see, I cheated.

21
00:01:02,634 --> 00:01:05,565
I lived in Edmonton, Alberta. I still live in Edmonton, Alberta.

22
00:01:05,605 --> 00:01:09,614
-- And what's interesting. So, there was,
-- we'll put high speed in quotes.

23
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:14,540
So, no, no, no, no. Here's the thing. Edmonton is fascinating because we had our own

24
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,419
phone company, Edel,

25
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,629
because basically Alexander Graham Bell refused to install phones out here.

26
00:01:19,639 --> 00:01:23,400
So they started a phone company out here that then became a GT tell us blah, blah,

27
00:01:23,419 --> 00:01:23,519
blah.

28
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,410
But we had, the city is split in half by a river.

29
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,800
And traditionally there were two cable companies, Von

30
00:01:29,059 --> 00:01:29,569
and Shaw

31
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:30,910
and Vide

32
00:01:31,029 --> 00:01:33,069
on had a problem which is

33
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,290
they sold cable TV to everybody that would buy cable TV.

34
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,919
So the only time they got like a significant

35
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,300
number of new subscribers is if somebody built a subdivision

36
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,050
and so they were like,

37
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,889
well, ok, cool. What, what can we sell people to make more money?

38
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,519
Well, the answer is high speed internet and see Von had the foresight

39
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:51,970
when they built up their physical network,

40
00:01:52,309 --> 00:01:58,730
they installed the bidirectional amplifiers. Most cable companies installed

41
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,720
the unit directional amplifiers that just

42
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,330
amplify the signal going down. Because why?

43
00:02:05,339 --> 00:02:06,089
Well, you'll never,

44
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:07,980
you're never going to need to amplify the signal coming back

45
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:09,690
up because that's just not a thing that will happen.

46
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:11,410
That's right. We'll never do that. But Vide

47
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:11,839
on

48
00:02:12,059 --> 00:02:14,050
had spent the extra money.

49
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:15,720
And of course, this is one of those things where it's like, yeah,

50
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:17,570
a bidirectional amplifier costs a few bucks

51
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,139
more than a unit directional amplifier.

52
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:21,809
But retrofitting it after the fact costs

53
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,529
like, all the money basically. Right. Like across an entire city.

54
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:29,089
Like, I can't even fathom the number.

55
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,580
Um, so anyways,

56
00:02:30,589 --> 00:02:34,270
they had this network that was physically capable of deploying cable modems on.

57
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:34,809
So they did.

58
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:41,070
So I actually had 10 megabit down one megabit up on metered internet back in 9798.

59
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:41,460
Right.

60
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:42,610
Yeah.

61
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,729
And I hate to say this but like on Irc like you annoyed me,

62
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,089
I would just ping flood you just,

63
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:48,369
and you would disappear

64
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,580
because

65
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,289
-- I'll be blunt, one megabit versus dial up.
-- I mean, look in 1998

66
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:59,399
it would have been no 1996. It probably would have been, I went to work for an ISP

67
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:05,259
and it was, it was a big deal because we had a T one which was what, 1.5 megabits, I think

68
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,729
544 megabits.

69
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,789
-- It was 24 bonded.
-- Uh

70
00:03:09,059 --> 00:03:10,990
Yeah, we had a T one to the office

71
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,990
-- 24 bonded
-- channels. It was amazing

72
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:17,509
because I could download a Linux distribution

73
00:03:17,779 --> 00:03:18,550
in an hour.

74
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,110
Yeah.

75
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:20,809
Yeah.

76
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:21,539
No,

77
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,830
it's um they deployed 10 megabit down one megabit up

78
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:27,479
uh Motorola cable modems that ran hot enough that I,

79
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,779
that's where I get my coffee mug.

80
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,229
They actually had a pretty fat internet pipe but more

81
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,539
to the point nobody was using bandwidth back then.

82
00:03:34,899 --> 00:03:36,100
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, like

83
00:03:36,339 --> 00:03:39,500
there literally was nothing you could do that would actually consume that

84
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:41,889
much bandwidth unless you were somebody like me or you who's like,

85
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,350
I'm going to download all the Linux

86
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,589
and also, you know, Napster,

87
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:48,539
maybe some wares or something like Napster.

88
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:48,750
That's

89
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:50,240
honestly,

90
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,160
that's one of the reasons I ran Linux is because it had all the apps I wanted.

91
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:55,410
No, I know, I know

92
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,710
it, it was, I mean, you think back then all of the Linux software

93
00:03:59,899 --> 00:04:03,479
you had to buy a UNIX Workstation, which was like 40 grand.

94
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:04,699
I mean,

95
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:07,720
no, I had a P 100 with eight megs of R AM.

96
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:09,179
-- Yeah,
-- those are the days. Anyway,

97
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:11,820
today we wanted to talk about working from home,

98
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:15,839
which I know isn't exactly a security topic and we pretend we're a security podcast.

99
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:16,899
But fundamentally,

100
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,380
there has been all this weird talk of working from home and Kurt

101
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,920
and I have literally been doing this for decades at this point.

102
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:22,459
And we thought

103
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,440
what a fun topic because I feel like everyone talking about it

104
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,230
is

105
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:31,720
a moron or at least everyone against work from home. That's what I feel like.

106
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,989
So let's get two quick things out of the way. The first one is,

107
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,179
there's a whole bunch of jobs you can't do from home,

108
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:38,640
like

109
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:42,029
brain surgery or uh, oh, good one airline pilot.

110
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,079
Not yet. Anyway,

111
00:04:43,489 --> 00:04:44,109
maybe later.

112
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,420
And so I accept that there's not just accept like I get it,

113
00:04:47,429 --> 00:04:49,720
there's a bunch of jobs you can't do from home.

114
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:53,679
-- Restaurants.
-- Right. Like a chef. You know what I mean? Like, yes, there are

115
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:54,089
there.

116
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,950
And I want,

117
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,670
we should also point out there are people who don't like working from home.

118
00:04:57,679 --> 00:04:58,549
And that's great too.

119
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,029
There's nothing wrong with working from home,

120
00:05:01,204 --> 00:05:02,654
-- not working from home. The
-- other thing.

121
00:05:02,665 --> 00:05:03,834
Well, and this is a tangent,

122
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,674
but there's also a big difference between choosing to work

123
00:05:05,684 --> 00:05:07,345
from home and being forced to work from home.

124
00:05:07,355 --> 00:05:09,295
Which is interesting because when COVID started,

125
00:05:09,445 --> 00:05:13,584
I've been working from home for over 20 years and within about two or three months,

126
00:05:13,595 --> 00:05:14,945
uh, I remember it was in March, I was,

127
00:05:14,954 --> 00:05:17,184
I realized something was off and I realized what it

128
00:05:17,195 --> 00:05:19,054
was is I was now being forced to work from home

129
00:05:19,065 --> 00:05:22,345
in the sense of I couldn't go out for a cup of coffee once every week or two where I,

130
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:22,545
you know,

131
00:05:22,554 --> 00:05:24,984
go to a coffee shop and sit and do my work for

132
00:05:24,994 --> 00:05:26,625
an hour or two just to be around people a bit.

133
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,779
That was no longer an option. Right.

134
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:32,410
And my kids were here all the time doing online school and it was, you know, so, I mean,

135
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,910
and, and I have a house so, I mean, especially if you're stuck in a, in a,

136
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,779
in an apartment with your kids trying to work from home.

137
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:37,859
God,

138
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:38,380
no.

139
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,380
Right. I get it. That's not ideal.

140
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,950
The other thing, let's get out of the way is I, I get it.

141
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,619
There's a whole bunch of like, locally,

142
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,470
the government is forcing the government to go back to work downtown because

143
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:48,600
a

144
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:50,625
downtown is going to create her out, right?

145
00:05:50,635 --> 00:05:52,494
Like people have to return to the office or

146
00:05:52,505 --> 00:05:54,334
the downtown economy is going to poop itself again.

147
00:05:54,345 --> 00:05:56,654
Like uh and we already had that happen once in Edmonton when

148
00:05:56,934 --> 00:05:58,915
they built West Edmonton Mall out here in the west end

149
00:05:59,075 --> 00:05:59,744
and it, like,

150
00:05:59,755 --> 00:06:02,535
literally vacuumed up like all the stores because it just

151
00:06:02,545 --> 00:06:05,165
had like such a inertia and gravity to it.

152
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:10,225
But like, literally Edmonton's downtown was dead for about like 10 years.

153
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:13,980
I mean, that happened in a lot of places due to malls

154
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,690
and w like big box stores will just say I won't necessarily blame Walmart. But

155
00:06:18,809 --> 00:06:21,640
yeah, well, and urban decay and all those other things.

156
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,109
Right. Right. And

157
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,989
it's, it's changing now. But

158
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,230
-- yeah, and
-- so I get that there's a big push like San Francisco is like,

159
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:29,510
pretty freaked out about,

160
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:32,739
like, if five or 10% of these tech companies leave

161
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:34,910
-- real estate rates will crater
-- out.

162
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:38,779
They won't crater out. The, the return to normal, like

163
00:06:40,829 --> 00:06:43,339
by San Francisco standards is cratering out.

164
00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:45,809
-- Ok. That's fair. Right. Yes,
-- it would.

165
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,320
You know, same with New York.

166
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,820
Yes. Exactly.

167
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,100
Although ironically now because of all the work from home,

168
00:06:52,109 --> 00:06:57,380
the real estate in everywhere else is out of control, which is its own weird problem.

169
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:57,690
But

170
00:06:58,059 --> 00:06:59,140
anyway, anyway.

171
00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:02,730
Ok. Ok. So I, I agree with your statements.

172
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,200
And then a third thing is that I get that

173
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:08,429
there are business cultures that don't do work from home,

174
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,089
especially I,

175
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,640
I think basically what our conversation boils down to

176
00:07:11,649 --> 00:07:13,359
is it has to come from the top down

177
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,989
and see. And that's why I, I was able to work from home back in 98.

178
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Is Jim Revis the CEO then of Security portal.com.

179
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,980
Now the CEO of the cloud security lines, he worked from home.

180
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,070
Oh, I didn't realize you worked for Jim back then. That's hilarious.

181
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,760
I've been working, I've been contracting for Jim for, I think now, what is it?

182
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,700
14 or 15

183
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,809
out of the last 24 years?

184
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,320
-- Wow.
-- Like that's

185
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:35,850
that poor

186
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:36,100
guy.

187
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:36,420
I

188
00:07:36,929 --> 00:07:36,950
know.

189
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,480
I know

190
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,119
it's uh

191
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:43,170
like I knew Jim when he had a blackberry.

192
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:44,179
Wow.

193
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:44,920
Wow,

194
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:45,309
that's,

195
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,420
that's hilarious.

196
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:52,059
So that's the thing. He worked from home and he needed flexible work time

197
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,160
because he also wanted to be with his family and stuff. And so

198
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,279
he's kind of set that culture and well, that's why I work there

199
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,970
and why I continue to contract for him, you know, because

200
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:09,279
that flexibility of work life balance. Like he, he not only says it like he means it,

201
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,049
I get that there's a lot of places like,

202
00:08:11,059 --> 00:08:12,660
like those tweets from Boris Johnson were

203
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,170
classic because it's clear that Boris Johnson,

204
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:19,480
I, I don't know that he has a DH D but it's clear that the man cannot like,

205
00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:20,839
work unsupervised.

206
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,279
-- No, that's, that's all I got.
-- Maybe

207
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,059
I, I wonder this. So,

208
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,029
the thing I always think of

209
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:33,479
is if you look at Boris Johnson, he appears to be a bumbling idiot,

210
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,840
but he's clearly not

211
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:35,539
a great person.

212
00:08:35,989 --> 00:08:40,140
He went to impressive schools. He's clearly a very smart person.

213
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,320
I mean, I always think of the,

214
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,739
when he was asked about his hobbies and he said he paints

215
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,169
pictures of buses

216
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,789
and it was clearly a way to Google bomb away some bad press of his. And, and like

217
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:57,940
before or since none of us have ever seen a picture of Boris Johnson's painted buses,

218
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:58,489
which

219
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,130
if you do, you know, if you have a hobby like that,

220
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,289
you show people and you don't stop talking about it because that's just how it works,

221
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:05,539
right?

222
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:06,059
It's like,

223
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:11,179
actually, it was very funny. I'm just reminded of a little side tangent.

224
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,200
There is a picture on,

225
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,239
I think on Reddit

226
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:14,039
where

227
00:09:14,229 --> 00:09:17,989
it was one of the, would you recommend windows to your friends?

228
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:20,719
And someone clicked, you know? No.

229
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:21,640
And then it was,

230
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,849
please explain your answer and they said you don't need to understand

231
00:09:23,859 --> 00:09:27,260
like us normal people don't walk around talking about our operating systems.

232
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,979
And the first comment was like, have you ever talked to a Linux person?

233
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:30,799
You know,

234
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:31,719
I laughed out loud,

235
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,500
but

236
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,419
it was like, I totally get that

237
00:09:34,669 --> 00:09:35,659
but, but anyway,

238
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:40,169
and so my suspicion is not that Boris Johnson can't work from home.

239
00:09:40,219 --> 00:09:43,869
There's probably something else going on here because he's probably smart

240
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,849
enough to not actually be distracted by cheese and coffee.

241
00:09:46,859 --> 00:09:48,330
Even though I will say I do

242
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:49,510
cheese and coffee

243
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,530
is

244
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,359
work from home.

245
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:56,409
Forces you to have better process because you can't paper over cracks.

246
00:09:56,419 --> 00:09:59,419
So a great example of this is, this is my favorite story and I've told it before. But

247
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:02,090
long story short, I was working at, I was contracting for a place

248
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,900
and I was on a conference call and my

249
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:06,640
then manager was very upset because he's like her,

250
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,750
you don't seem to read these emails.

251
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,049
I have to email you myself personally and then you finally do it.

252
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:10,380
And I'm like,

253
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,030
I read every email from you and I do what you

254
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:14,390
tell me to because you guys pay me and like that's,

255
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,789
that's kind of how this works, right?

256
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,049
Transactional relationship.

257
00:10:17,739 --> 00:10:20,359
And he's like, it's like every email to the at home list. You don't read it.

258
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,640
And I'm like the what now list

259
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:24,630
and he's like, you guys, can we check if Kurt's on the at home list?

260
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,760
And they're like, no, he's not.

261
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,960
And so he apologized and he's like, can we please put Kurt on the at home list?

262
00:10:29,109 --> 00:10:33,000
You know, to tell people what to do. But that's the thing working from home.

263
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,280
Like I have a very

264
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,789
simple policy of if you don't put it down in writing to me, it doesn't exist.

265
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:43,059
And I don't mean Slack. Slack is too ephemeral. Like, either it's an email or a ticket

266
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:45,289
and if it's like, if it's not captured,

267
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:49,510
like if you don't tell me in a way that it gets captured doesn't exist.

268
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,150
And I've trained people to do this

269
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:55,109
and it works really well, but it takes a lot of discipline to do that

270
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:58,000
And a lot of places don't have that kind of

271
00:10:58,229 --> 00:10:58,989
culture.

272
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:02,190
You know, they, they sort of discuss things around the water cooler, but they don't

273
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,830
how many places take good meeting minutes and distribute the meeting minutes

274
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,190
or archive them in a place that you can easily find them.

275
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,460
I mean, it's, it's very uncommon,

276
00:11:11,469 --> 00:11:14,330
I think in the business world for that to be the case if,

277
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,859
if you look at organizations like the Cloud Security

278
00:11:16,869 --> 00:11:19,369
Alliance or many of the Linux Foundation's working groups,

279
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,849
they actually do a really good job of this because they have to,

280
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:24,690
you know, because they're, they're completely virtual

281
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:28,630
well. And I think coming from the open source world too. So that's the other trick.

282
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,119
You and I are both open source freaks.

283
00:11:30,849 --> 00:11:32,710
Open source has been work from home since ever.

284
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,500
And I count the people working in open source who are

285
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:39,270
in offices as work from home because they're collaborating remotely anyways,

286
00:11:39,349 --> 00:11:42,960
like they may physically be at an office because it's not like the Linux kernel,

287
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:43,989
they don't have an office.

288
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,640
Like some of the contributors probably work together

289
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,190
in offices because it's big enough now.

290
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,169
But like back in the day, like in 19 nineties and two thousands, you know, that

291
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:56,729
it's so spread out, it has to be virtualized and distributed.

292
00:11:57,239 --> 00:11:57,270
Right.

293
00:11:57,409 --> 00:11:58,450
That's right. And

294
00:11:58,849 --> 00:12:02,890
it used to amuse me to no end when I started working at Red Hat

295
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,119
and I would ask someone something who I knew was in an office

296
00:12:07,469 --> 00:12:10,059
because I, I worked, I worked remote the whole hours at Red Hat.

297
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,429
I started there in 2004

298
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:13,530
and I'd ask someone something in the office and then I

299
00:12:13,539 --> 00:12:15,429
just seen them send an Irc message and it's like,

300
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,309
well, I can freaking do that like, yeah, exactly.

301
00:12:18,469 --> 00:12:19,650
That was the culture, right?

302
00:12:19,659 --> 00:12:20,940
Even if you were in an office,

303
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:24,820
you still used IRC to communicate because that was the way you communicated.

304
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,099
I remember being at a P

305
00:12:26,229 --> 00:12:26,700
to own

306
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,700
in Vancouver in a

307
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,299
office or in a uh in the hotel room with my then boss

308
00:12:32,349 --> 00:12:34,950
and we're writing up like there's this really bad zero day the drop.

309
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,289
So we had to write it up and analyze it.

310
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:39,849
And we were using Irc and we were sitting 6 ft apart from each other.

311
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,570
-- I, I have no problem with that because that was
-- our culture.

312
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,239
Like we were both just silently sitting in this hotel room,

313
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,409
politely ignoring each other,

314
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:48,570
banging away on our laptops trying to get this thing out.

315
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,260
And I, like, literally at one point forced myself to turn to him.

316
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,770
And I was like, I need, I need to go buy a Pepsi.

317
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,530
He's like, don't waste your time, call room service.

318
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:58,140
And I, you know, call him and like, the minimum is a six pack.

319
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:01,070
He's like, he's like, I don't care. Just, we need to get this out in the next hour.

320
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,419
Like, I don't care that we're,

321
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:04,239
it was like $20 for that Pepsi.

322
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,630
And he's like, I don't care, we just need to get this out. Whatever.

323
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,380
That's money well spent. Like, it's, that's the culture, right?

324
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:13,270
It's like we used Yeah, IRC and everything was captured and text and

325
00:13:13,619 --> 00:13:15,679
like, I had a deaf coworker and I'm like,

326
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:19,960
he sends out an email saying I'm deaf. So if you come to my office, you need to like,

327
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:25,059
physically get my attention because like, if like, I can't hear you, I can read lips,

328
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,659
but I can't read lips if I'm not looking at you.

329
00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:29,719
And I, like, I remember literally contacting my RC and I'm like,

330
00:13:29,729 --> 00:13:31,270
I hate to say this but like, you're really deaf.

331
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,630
He's like, yeah, I'm like, oh, I had no idea. Cool

332
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,559
because like, I work remotely with the, with him. Like, how would,

333
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:37,280
right?

334
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:39,919
And that's one thing I love about work from home is

335
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:43,030
I've, I've worked with people with, you know, various

336
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,239
different abilities or lifestyles.

337
00:13:45,349 --> 00:13:47,109
Don't know or care they get good work done.

338
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:49,469
And I think that's part of it is, it removes that

339
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,460
sort of it in some ways, removes that social aspect, which can also, I think,

340
00:13:53,469 --> 00:13:54,130
be very good.

341
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:58,489
Yes. Now I want to shift the conversation a little bit because

342
00:13:58,739 --> 00:13:59,799
rather than

343
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,880
pining upon all of the benefits from work, work from home,

344
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,919
which clearly we are enormous fans of,

345
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,330
I think and,

346
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:10,090
and we won't even get into all of like the Daily commute and the grind and all that.

347
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:10,890
Let's ignore that.

348
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,530
So

349
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,940
I, I, what I find the most interesting

350
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,859
is you brought this up at the beginning where you're talking about,

351
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:18,890
the government is making people go to

352
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,539
downtown because they're worried downtown will suffer.

353
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,030
And I think that I think

354
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:28,229
when we hear everyone talk about work from home, that's not what they talk about.

355
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:29,469
There's always some other reason.

356
00:14:29,479 --> 00:14:32,679
It, it's, we need camaraderie, we need culture, we need

357
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:36,039
-- less cheese, whatever
-- face to face communications. Right.

358
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:36,309
Right.

359
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:42,369
I feel like what we're actually witnessing is people know this is coming,

360
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,659
I think they know there's nothing they can do about it.

361
00:14:44,669 --> 00:14:46,489
And they're actually worried about

362
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,559
the, the 3rd and 4th order

363
00:14:49,809 --> 00:14:51,090
things that are going to

364
00:14:51,239 --> 00:14:55,159
like an easy example is if I'm a big Silicon Valley company

365
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,650
and I just built a brand new building

366
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,719
and then all my workers had to go home

367
00:15:00,289 --> 00:15:03,010
and we'll say this is all theoretical of course,

368
00:15:03,219 --> 00:15:06,320
-- I just built this brand new, beautiful building. The windows don't
-- open.

369
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:10,320
-- Yeah, nothing to do with the fruit company,
-- right? Shaped like a rib maybe

370
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,039
and,

371
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:15,729
-- and everyone goes home and I'm like
-- located at one infinity wave, right?

372
00:15:15,739 --> 00:15:18,250
We just built this big expensive fancy building.

373
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:22,729
Like you all need to get your asses back in here and people are like, we don't want to.

374
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:23,590
What do you do?

375
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:26,409
You just, you have this huge capital expense,

376
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,849
you literally cannot sell this building to anyone because

377
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,599
even like there's just no market for it.

378
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,890
-- What do you do?
-- Well, and I think there's worse things too.

379
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,890
So, so many companies like Red Hat

380
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:42,320
pay remote people based on where they are.

381
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,780
And so for example, somebody living in America,

382
00:15:44,789 --> 00:15:47,320
even within different parts of America gets different pay, you know,

383
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:50,270
and vastly more pay compared to say somebody in India or

384
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:53,309
some other, you know, quote unquote cheaper country.

385
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,280
And so what's interesting is some companies are now,

386
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,200
uh like airbnb basically announced we're going to be

387
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,840
work from home if you want or you can,

388
00:15:59,849 --> 00:16:02,510
you come into the office if you're that kind of crazy, but sure, whatever,

389
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:05,359
but we're gonna pay you based on what you're worth, not

390
00:16:05,659 --> 00:16:06,940
where you live.

391
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:09,520
And I think that's one big problem for a

392
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:12,909
lot of these companies because they've historically trenched incomes

393
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:15,119
because, well, let's talk about pay a little bit.

394
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:16,460
I remember working at Red hat.

395
00:16:16,469 --> 00:16:20,099
And you and I both knew that we were making quite a

396
00:16:20,109 --> 00:16:23,150
bit more than some of our coworkers doing basically the exact same work

397
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:25,950
-- just in different parts of the world.
-- They lived in a different country.

398
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:26,690
I know.

399
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:30,190
-- I know.
-- And that struck me as kind of desperately unfair.

400
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,440
It's completely unfair, I think.

401
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:34,599
And what's funny? So, here again,

402
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:38,179
you end up with this argument where people are complaining

403
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,960
in small towns like where I live, I live in Green Bay, Wisconsin

404
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,840
where there are people coming in from

405
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,960
large cities that are getting paid

406
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,000
five times what the local rate might be

407
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,530
and they're just writing checks for houses because they're like,

408
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:54,659
look how cheap the property is.

409
00:16:54,669 --> 00:16:56,750
-- This is great. Like I'll take that house there,
-- please.

410
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,479
We have that problem in Canada with, you know,

411
00:16:58,489 --> 00:17:00,030
uh foreign investors coming to Toronto and

412
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:02,299
Vancouver because real estate in Canada is,

413
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,069
it's a real safe thing to invest in.

414
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,010
Like it's gonna go up

415
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:10,469
-- and Canada is a nice boring country with
-- healthcare, right? Oh, no, no, I, I get it.

416
00:17:10,479 --> 00:17:13,209
And so like again, we get to that like 2nd and 3rd

417
00:17:13,348 --> 00:17:14,150
a problem

418
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,839
that all of this creates

419
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:16,810
and

420
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:17,250
I,

421
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,979
I am sensitive to this problem because I think

422
00:17:19,989 --> 00:17:22,319
that like there are definite housing problems in many,

423
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:24,530
many parts of, of, of the world.

424
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:26,390
But I also know that

425
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:30,880
the answer to this is not, oh, just stop working from home like that's,

426
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,979
that's out of the question. Right. That's like that would be like saying when

427
00:17:35,469 --> 00:17:38,829
New York City in the early 19 hundreds started building subways

428
00:17:38,979 --> 00:17:41,750
and the people who fed and cared for horses in

429
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,219
the city were going out of business being like,

430
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,699
oh, everyone just stop taking the subway.

431
00:17:44,709 --> 00:17:48,910
Like, no, this is a change that is coming. There's nothing you can do about

432
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:53,160
it in that other industry while necessary in the past.

433
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,849
Like, it needs to change.

434
00:17:54,859 --> 00:17:58,270
Well, see, this is one of my hopes is, I mean, right now in western Canada, you know,

435
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,050
small towns are bleeding out because

436
00:18:00,219 --> 00:18:01,939
living there kind of sucks.

437
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,449
And,

438
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:08,089
you know, there's, I mean, there's been articles for a decade or two about, you know,

439
00:18:08,219 --> 00:18:09,750
the entire graduating class of the

440
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,130
small Saskatchewan town is leaving after graduation

441
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:16,050
and the town is happy about it because their kids have a future now.

442
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:16,619
Oh,

443
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:16,790
yeah.

444
00:18:16,989 --> 00:18:17,439
Right.

445
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:19,199
But the town knows that they're basically gonna

446
00:18:19,209 --> 00:18:20,849
die because all the young people are moving away

447
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:24,010
but they're happy about it because what's the alternative

448
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,729
you live in this town with no industry.

449
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,079
Well, a lot of,

450
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:30,810
a lot of rural communities don't take that particular attitude towards

451
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,280
the change occurring around them. But

452
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:34,510
no,

453
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:35,500
but I, I

454
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,209
would like to hope that we have better housing policy,

455
00:18:38,219 --> 00:18:40,119
things like UB I universal basic income.

456
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,469
And I know that's not going to be the case and I know it's going to be messy and painful.

457
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:43,839
You know,

458
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:47,439
we've already got resort towns here in Alberta where nobody can afford to live.

459
00:18:47,449 --> 00:18:50,680
Same thing in the US in Colorado and stuff. There's ski towns where literally

460
00:18:50,969 --> 00:18:53,000
nobody that works there can afford to live there.

461
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:56,209
And so what's interesting though is it becomes, it,

462
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:59,689
it actually seems to correct relatively.

463
00:18:59,829 --> 00:19:00,050
Well, not,

464
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,469
I'm not going to say it corrects relatively

465
00:19:01,479 --> 00:19:03,930
quickly but the pain becomes known relatively quickly

466
00:19:03,939 --> 00:19:07,150
when you have a town full of rich people and nobody to work at the restaurants.

467
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,060
-- I mean,
-- we're, we're seeing that now. I, I don't know how this ends.

468
00:19:11,069 --> 00:19:13,170
We're gonna, we're gonna find out because

469
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:15,170
-- like it's coming, well,
-- like I said,

470
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,030
hopefully we see some intelligent housing policy and stuff.

471
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,130
I'm not going to hold my breath though.

472
00:19:19,349 --> 00:19:23,349
Yeah, I'm, I'm not either. I mean, but ok, anyway, I don't, I don't want to do it.

473
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,579
I want to get into government policy around housing because it's,

474
00:19:25,589 --> 00:19:29,199
it's not only depressing but it's unsolvable by us, obviously.

475
00:19:29,229 --> 00:19:31,979
Well, and I think that's what's so fascinating to me about work from home. Is it,

476
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:35,900
it's such a fundamental shift in reality. Like,

477
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:39,250
both my sons have been doing online school and it really

478
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,449
works for Felix and it doesn't work for Wolfgang at all.

479
00:19:41,459 --> 00:19:42,400
And that's another story.

480
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,949
But how is somebody going to hire Felix when

481
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:47,319
he's done 2.5 or three years of online school

482
00:19:47,489 --> 00:19:50,819
and tell him he has to come into the office to work, like, unless he's a, you know,

483
00:19:50,829 --> 00:19:53,020
like he was a brain surgeon, he'll be like, yeah, obviously.

484
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:53,910
But,

485
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,689
you know, chances are statistically white collar work.

486
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,930
Yeah, you can do that from home.

487
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,500
Well, and that's what's going to happen. I think that, that, that's one of the points

488
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,310
that, that's on my list was

489
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,560
if you look at the future generations,

490
00:20:07,569 --> 00:20:10,619
if you're an organization saying you have to move to,

491
00:20:10,829 --> 00:20:14,400
you know, somewhere in California to work for us, they're going to be like, well,

492
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:17,420
I'm just not going to work for you then like, whatever who cares?

493
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:17,699
-- You
-- know,

494
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:19,619
I can't afford it. And B

495
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,390
I have to rip up.

496
00:20:21,349 --> 00:20:22,569
The other thing too is

497
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:25,520
because we're at the CS A, we're hiring right now and it's, you know,

498
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,939
the CS A is based out of a small town called Bellingham.

499
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:31,459
There's not a lot of cloud security talent in a, you know,

500
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,510
and all the cloud security talent in that area has

501
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,859
been hoovered up by Microsoft and Amazon in Seattle,

502
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:36,430
right?

503
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,380
Like they're the, you know,

504
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:41,069
they have this massive gravity and they just suck in everybody, you know, I mean,

505
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:43,410
Amazon to the point where they had to open up a second headquarters

506
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,359
because essentially everybody that lived in Seattle that would work for them,

507
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:48,540
works for them and everybody that would move to Seattle

508
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,510
has already moved to Seattle and works for them.

509
00:20:50,729 --> 00:20:53,209
And they literally can't get more people there.

510
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:53,959
And so they

511
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,180
opened up their second headquarters,

512
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,150
you bring this up. And here's an interesting point to think about is so

513
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:02,010
back in the early days of Silicon Valley,

514
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:06,869
the idea was we will move to this area because that's where the talent is, right?

515
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,989
Like we have to move to where the talent is in effect.

516
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,829
Microsoft specifically went to Redmond Washington

517
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,010
because

518
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:16,900
they wanted the people they hire to not be able to easily switch jobs.

519
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:18,010
Right?

520
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:20,239
And ironically then because they went there,

521
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:23,300
it built up this whole industry in the area with,

522
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:27,489
I mean, I remember reading a history of the company Nintendo at one point

523
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,400
and they were looking for someone to put their offer.

524
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:33,219
They're like, oh, Seattle Microsoft is there. It must be a cool tech place.

525
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:35,619
Like, no, actually it's the opposite.

526
00:21:36,449 --> 00:21:39,069
But, you know, it was the beginning and that is true.

527
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:42,599
I mean, I remember like back in the nineties when I first started working, no,

528
00:21:42,609 --> 00:21:45,839
it was the early two thousands when I got my, I got out of college and got my job,

529
00:21:46,219 --> 00:21:50,020
there was this thing they called the Valley shuffle where like every six months

530
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:53,130
you'd get a new job somewhere in Silicon Valley and

531
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:57,079
you, you knew all the people because you'd work with them somewhere else before.

532
00:21:57,089 --> 00:21:57,489
Right?

533
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,359
And everyone just kind of kept moving around

534
00:21:59,369 --> 00:22:02,140
in this weird shuffling nature throughout Silicon Valley.

535
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:02,479
And

536
00:22:02,939 --> 00:22:06,359
it it's very interesting because with a concept, like, work from home

537
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,709
you don't have to go to San Francisco anymore to find talent.

538
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:11,079
You can literally find the talent

539
00:22:11,369 --> 00:22:12,869
anywhere, anywhere they are.

540
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:16,859
Yeah. No, we, we interviewed four people and they were scattered all over the US.

541
00:22:17,089 --> 00:22:17,869
Yeah, that's awesome.

542
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:23,880
Like from Florida to, I want to say Colorado to somewhere in the middle ish,

543
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,319
you know, the Midwest, whatever. That is. That big giant blob of

544
00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:32,319
-- stuff you fly over mostly
-- we, we have the Great Lakes. It's very nice.

545
00:22:32,569 --> 00:22:34,150
Yeah, I've been there. I do like it.

546
00:22:34,469 --> 00:22:37,800
But, um, and I think part of it is there's,

547
00:22:38,969 --> 00:22:43,219
I mean, if you thought adoption of enterprise software took a long time,

548
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:45,550
adoption of new corporate culture

549
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,170
and as you've pointed out, like,

550
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:51,300
you can't change corporate culture without some sort of massive,

551
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:52,060
like,

552
00:22:52,069 --> 00:22:54,300
call to action or existential threat that

553
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:57,099
-- they actually understand or
-- maybe a pandemic.

554
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,810
But even then, like, how many, like, what blows my mind is we've had

555
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:03,250
so many things have improved.

556
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,369
Like for one of my favorite things is, is all the medicines

557
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,640
here. Now, the vast majority of them do

558
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:09,130
no more walking appointments.

559
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,719
You have to make an appointment or better, you make an online appointment.

560
00:23:12,729 --> 00:23:13,699
And I get, again,

561
00:23:13,709 --> 00:23:15,979
there are certain things where you want to go into the doctor and have them like,

562
00:23:15,989 --> 00:23:20,180
poke it or palpitate it or like, see, you know, that, that is a weird color, you know,

563
00:23:20,189 --> 00:23:22,260
but there's a lot of things that you can do over the phone.

564
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:26,800
Like I, you know, I wanted to go get my, uh, uh, a vaccine for pneumo cocoa

565
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,959
and, you know, talked with my doctor quickly about it.

566
00:23:28,969 --> 00:23:29,619
He's like, yeah, you know,

567
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,790
you should probably get that because you're prone to a lung infection.

568
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,199
So,

569
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:35,160
that would be good, you know, five minute phone call done. Right.

570
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,160
Otherwise if I go and see him, even without waiting, it's still an hour round trip.

571
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:40,250
Yeah.

572
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:40,869
You know,

573
00:23:41,459 --> 00:23:44,130
and I have to sit in a waiting room with potentially sick people. So

574
00:23:44,469 --> 00:23:44,550
I

575
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,050
know

576
00:23:45,239 --> 00:23:46,890
there's a lot of places that are getting

577
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,849
like rid of these improvements that they made,

578
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:50,780
especially in the government.

579
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,619
Like the government is reopening offices so the

580
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,969
public can physically come back to visit.

581
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:58,290
And it's like, but wait, you managed to go two years without people visiting.

582
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,770
Why do we need to go back to that?

583
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,469
Right. Well, because we have to provide service to people. Yeah.

584
00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:03,829
But you provided service to people for

585
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:05,489
two years without them physically being there.

586
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,410
Well, sometimes, I mean, you also have to admit that there were

587
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,390
many,

588
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,599
I guess, like,

589
00:24:10,609 --> 00:24:13,359
donate whole events in government services during the

590
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:15,640
pandemic where people slipped through the cracks and,

591
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:18,050
and there were a lot of problems, I'm not going to say it was flawed

592
00:24:18,229 --> 00:24:18,790
but,

593
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:19,560
but

594
00:24:19,689 --> 00:24:22,920
you are, you are correct to a degree that I think

595
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:25,599
if you look at everything that happened during the pandemic,

596
00:24:25,609 --> 00:24:27,719
there was a remarkable amount of society that

597
00:24:27,729 --> 00:24:30,040
managed to function with everyone working from home.

598
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:30,989
And

599
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:34,150
I think it was one of those things, if you would have told people this was a case,

600
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,329
they would have been like no way.

601
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:37,969
That's impossible. But because we had to do it, we did it.

602
00:24:38,069 --> 00:24:41,109
I know some of the numbers, but basically at this point,

603
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,969
there are some government offices that are open

604
00:24:42,979 --> 00:24:44,589
that are seeing like two people a day.

605
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:46,050
And I'm like, why don't you just, you know,

606
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,699
do that thing in France where you call it and

607
00:24:47,709 --> 00:24:49,369
a doctor shows up at your doorstep an hour later,

608
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:53,689
like that would be cheaper and the person was like, yes, it, it would be cheaper.

609
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:56,319
It would be much better service obviously because like,

610
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:57,339
right,

611
00:24:57,569 --> 00:24:58,020
but, you know,

612
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:01,479
the government doesn't want or can't do that because it's seen as being too nice.

613
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,489
That is the sad truth.

614
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:06,089
Like who gets that white glove service? So

615
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:06,890
I,

616
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,540
I fear like

617
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,510
there are so many things where people are trying to, you know,

618
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,989
sort of shove it back to normal and especially managers with

619
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,290
bums and seeds because I was reading some papers about this.

620
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:16,729
And so

621
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,790
historically,

622
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,770
every measure of power at companies and organizations boils down to head count.

623
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,449
-- Yep.
-- Yep. Absolutely.

624
00:25:23,619 --> 00:25:26,040
With a second one being budget.

625
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:29,469
But even if you have a big budget, but no head count people don't take you seriously.

626
00:25:29,689 --> 00:25:31,410
Right. You need the people for sure.

627
00:25:32,369 --> 00:25:34,550
Yeah. And I think that's a big part of it is that,

628
00:25:35,469 --> 00:25:35,930
that

629
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:38,890
there's a lot of managers out there that aren't very good at managing.

630
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:40,199
Oh, yes.

631
00:25:40,369 --> 00:25:42,030
Unquestionable. That's it. I'm going to leave it at that.

632
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:45,130
I mean, you know what, this makes me think of. So,

633
00:25:45,469 --> 00:25:49,010
if you look at a lot of, I'll pick on call centers because II,

634
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,439
I have some examples of this.

635
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:51,560
I've heard of where

636
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,739
you had a very hierarchical,

637
00:25:54,069 --> 00:25:55,989
hierarchical, hierarchical, that's

638
00:25:56,219 --> 00:25:56,520
right

639
00:25:56,699 --> 00:25:57,410
structure

640
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,410
in these call centers, right?

641
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,170
We have the people doing the work and then they have supervisors

642
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,939
and then the supervisors and managers and the managers have managers and,

643
00:26:03,949 --> 00:26:06,329
you know, there's like 20 layers of stuff, whatever

644
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,219
and

645
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:07,979
when

646
00:26:08,189 --> 00:26:09,380
the pandemic hit

647
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:12,199
and everyone goes home all of a sudden now it's like, wait a minute,

648
00:26:12,209 --> 00:26:14,369
what is the supervisor actually doing if they're not like

649
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,199
walking around yelling at people to get back to work?

650
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:18,780
Right? Because now you have just, you're looking at the metrics, like

651
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,420
you answered four phone calls in an hour, everyone else answered 10.

652
00:26:22,489 --> 00:26:25,020
You're clearly slacking off, you know what I mean?

653
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,680
And so I think you also see these situations

654
00:26:27,689 --> 00:26:30,569
where it's that self preservation aspect where people are,

655
00:26:30,579 --> 00:26:32,219
like, if I'm not in an office,

656
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,359
they're gonna figure out I'm not actually doing any work, you know,

657
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:37,790
because like I need to be walking around and yelling at people.

658
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,680
That's my job.

659
00:26:39,719 --> 00:26:39,910
Yeah,

660
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,939
that's one thing I love is all

661
00:26:40,949 --> 00:26:43,780
these places that clearly can't measure productivity.

662
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,020
And

663
00:26:44,189 --> 00:26:45,780
again, I've read a bunch of papers on this.

664
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:48,630
We've never figured out a good way to measure white collar productivity because

665
00:26:48,939 --> 00:26:51,969
like, if you look at as well, infosec is a great example.

666
00:26:51,979 --> 00:26:53,540
You look at infosec, what's the value?

667
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:56,699
Well, the CS A hasn't been knowingly hacked.

668
00:26:57,459 --> 00:26:58,770
OK. What's the value of that?

669
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:01,560
No, I, I agree. Actually, I've got, I've got a good one for you.

670
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:02,959
This is, this is a treat.

671
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,640
So

672
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:09,219
there's a, an issue in one of the open ssf repos where they're talking about

673
00:27:09,699 --> 00:27:15,339
what is the right number of maintainers for a project to make it

674
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:16,140
good,

675
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:16,739
right?

676
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:17,140
Oh,

677
00:27:17,329 --> 00:27:18,020
easy. Seven,

678
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:19,160
whatever.

679
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:20,290
Seven,

680
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:21,099
shut up.

681
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,079
So

682
00:27:22,729 --> 00:27:25,199
someone asked this question and of course, everyone's like, oh,

683
00:27:25,209 --> 00:27:27,569
it's a good question actually, you know, it is a good question,

684
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:30,949
but here's the thing and, and everyone's like, oh, we should pick a number

685
00:27:31,209 --> 00:27:33,060
and I, I chime in of course because

686
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:37,599
II I, everything obviously and I'm like, actually I have all this N PM data

687
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:44,300
and of the 28 million N PM package releases that have happened in my data set.

688
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:47,959
Do you want to guess how many of those have one maintainer tied to them?

689
00:27:47,969 --> 00:27:49,969
I'll be somewhere between 90 95%.

690
00:27:49,979 --> 00:27:52,020
And I would assume a lot of those actually are tied,

691
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:54,540
like there's multiple packages tied to one maintainer.

692
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,670
You have to pick a number, you can't say 95 percent.

693
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,560
Sorry, what do you say of 28 million releases?

694
00:27:58,569 --> 00:28:01,959
I'm going to go with about like 20 I'm going to say 23.

695
00:28:02,069 --> 00:28:03,739
-- No,
-- it's 1616 million,

696
00:28:03,969 --> 00:28:05,189
but 16 million

697
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:05,599
way

698
00:28:05,869 --> 00:28:07,760
-- lower than I would guess. It
-- is kind of, I,

699
00:28:07,949 --> 00:28:08,079
I

700
00:28:08,209 --> 00:28:11,640
disagree with that, but it's a huge number, right? 16 million of those releases.

701
00:28:12,469 --> 00:28:12,530
And

702
00:28:12,689 --> 00:28:12,800
so

703
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:16,390
I point out there is a couple of issues now in, in thinking about this,

704
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,390
of saying number one,

705
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:22,069
we don't really have any data that says, does the number of maintainers even

706
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:26,520
directly influence the goodness or badness of an open source project?

707
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:29,180
Like we think it does, but we don't actually know,

708
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,939
I don't mean to be rude but have you defied good or badness?

709
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:32,619
Not yet.

710
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:33,339
No, that

711
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:35,260
that's part of the conversation.

712
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,390
-- Ok,
-- because I'm like, but

713
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,930
I, I think here's the thing is

714
00:28:39,189 --> 00:28:41,449
insecurity. We have

715
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:46,339
a notoriously bad habit of just like making crap up and saying, well, more,

716
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,719
more maintainers feels better.

717
00:28:47,729 --> 00:28:49,339
So let's say five or more. But

718
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,819
is it, I mean, how you making stuff up

719
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,369
isn't valuable

720
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:58,650
and I feel like a lot of this work from home or work in the office and everything,

721
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,020
like obviously, I want to say, oh, working from home is better

722
00:29:01,189 --> 00:29:04,859
and for my mental health, I, I don't doubt it is but you know what I mean? Like,

723
00:29:05,099 --> 00:29:07,599
we don't really have a lot of data, I think at this point,

724
00:29:07,609 --> 00:29:11,930
the only reason we really got to where we were is because society shut down for a year.

725
00:29:12,219 --> 00:29:13,719
And when we looked around, we're like,

726
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,540
actually this isn't so bad. Like we want to keep doing this, you know what I mean?

727
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:21,089
But is there data proving one thing or another? Like there really isn't?

728
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:21,520
Well,

729
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:24,089
Microsoft and some other companies have really studies showing

730
00:29:24,099 --> 00:29:27,099
that productivity went up or basically stayed the same,

731
00:29:27,209 --> 00:29:28,859
some have claimed that, you know,

732
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:32,000
kind of productivity was the same or better but like, you know,

733
00:29:32,969 --> 00:29:33,550
like

734
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,310
creativity was down or whatever, that means those kind of things, you know,

735
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:39,390
and again, I get it like there's certain, like,

736
00:29:39,439 --> 00:29:42,369
like if you're part of a design team that normally meets in a, you know,

737
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,510
in a room and brainstorms physically together on a white board,

738
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:49,930
you can't rep like I'll be blunt, you cannot replicate that with technology out.

739
00:29:50,229 --> 00:29:52,579
And I've looked into it because II I looked

740
00:29:52,589 --> 00:29:54,979
into like the highest end smart boards and everything

741
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:57,260
and they're flaming hot garbage compared to

742
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,780
a $200 white board with people physically present

743
00:29:59,989 --> 00:30:01,420
-- the
-- metaverse. Sorry,

744
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,439
the metaverse,

745
00:30:03,989 --> 00:30:07,140
-- maybe one day once we have
-- in all seriousness,

746
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:10,739
that's probably the best chance right now, but not right now.

747
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,020
But uh no, I, I agree.

748
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:12,540
And in fact,

749
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,849
you say that and a huge number of video

750
00:30:14,859 --> 00:30:18,660
game companies have delayed releases by years because they,

751
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:23,459
they're creative, people were struggling to get the creative work done from home.

752
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:28,359
So I agree, there's, there's totally, in fact, I was just at an all hands last week

753
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,839
through the magic of podcasting. No one knows there was an absence

754
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:32,729
but like,

755
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:35,410
I was on site for a week and it was absolutely

756
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:38,599
amazing being next to people and talking to them and,

757
00:30:38,609 --> 00:30:41,079
and the, the human interaction, of course, I'm like,

758
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:44,099
completely exhausted now because I haven't been anywhere in two years and it like,

759
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:45,839
drained me so much.

760
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,189
But yeah, I, I agree.

761
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:52,160
There is immense value in humans being together in a room but not every day.

762
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:53,290
Well, part of that is that

763
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,390
so I call it,

764
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:57,949
I call it the, oh by the way, effect of when you're face to face with somebody,

765
00:30:57,959 --> 00:31:01,680
they will say, oh, by the way, and then a super critical thing that you need to know,

766
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:02,910
right?

767
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:06,349
Or some problem that's been bugging them for years and you can solve in 20 minutes.

768
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:10,780
And the thing is I will literally put in emails, like, is there any, oh, by the way,

769
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,719
kind of things like pain points, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

770
00:31:12,729 --> 00:31:15,819
Or when I'm on, you know, calls with people, I will ask them, I'm like,

771
00:31:15,829 --> 00:31:16,959
is there anything else, like,

772
00:31:16,969 --> 00:31:20,109
no matter how weird or strange or painful or unpleasant or whatever

773
00:31:20,239 --> 00:31:22,969
that you want? To bring up or mention to me or email to me

774
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,479
and then sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.

775
00:31:25,489 --> 00:31:29,579
But again, having the discipline to do that and to ask that and to kind of,

776
00:31:29,589 --> 00:31:31,579
I think part of it too is people are afraid

777
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,270
to put things in writing that they will say to your face.

778
00:31:35,709 --> 00:31:38,150
Yeah, I, I, yes, I agree with that. And

779
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,040
I think in all seriousness, Kurt,

780
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:42,180
that is one of our superpowers.

781
00:31:42,189 --> 00:31:44,939
And I've talked to people about this at length because you and I

782
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,479
have no shame in looking dumb.

783
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,949
I mean, obviously you couldn't have a podcast if you were even because we are, I mean,

784
00:31:51,959 --> 00:31:53,719
that, that's what we tell people obviously.

785
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:54,650
But you know what I mean?

786
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:59,500
Like I will just spout nonsense into slack and it's not necessarily because I'm

787
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:03,380
trying to show I'm smart or something, it's to encourage

788
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:06,339
other people to get involved in some way.

789
00:32:06,689 --> 00:32:07,180
And

790
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,449
I find

791
00:32:08,589 --> 00:32:13,060
like in the morning, I will put a stupid meme in slack or something like that. And

792
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:16,459
90% of the time it elicits responses.

793
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:20,270
Whereas if no one says anything, it's, it's crickets and I think

794
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,130
part of working from home

795
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,250
is

796
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:25,989
making interactions happen sometimes.

797
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,459
So you have to force it where when you're in an office you're not forcing it.

798
00:32:29,469 --> 00:32:31,660
It's magically happening as you go get coffee.

799
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,040
But that doesn't exist.

800
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:33,819
You have to give some,

801
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:35,400
sometimes you just got to give it a little poke

802
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:37,400
with a stick and it goes a really long way.

803
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:41,280
And you also have to recognize, you have to be able to look stupid because you will.

804
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:42,949
And that's scary and hard.

805
00:32:42,959 --> 00:32:47,589
Especially for new people and young people in any organization. Luckily I'm old

806
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,069
and I don't care.

807
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:49,910
Well, when you think about it,

808
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,290
humans have had thousands of years of face to face interactions of like,

809
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,099
one of my favorite things is most people can with

810
00:32:57,109 --> 00:32:59,910
almost no effort tell where somebody else's eyes are looking,

811
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,069
right?

812
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:04,000
Like there's a big chunk of the brain devoted to basically figuring

813
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:06,469
that out because it's really important in face to face interactions,

814
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:09,050
to kind of read body language and stuff, not everybody can do it.

815
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,300
You know, I have a son with autism and

816
00:33:10,459 --> 00:33:12,640
right, it's, it can be challenging for some people

817
00:33:12,829 --> 00:33:13,300
but,

818
00:33:13,689 --> 00:33:16,900
and the technology, especially for real time communications, like,

819
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:20,650
let's start with the phone basically being, you know, kind of the first one, right?

820
00:33:20,969 --> 00:33:24,530
Because I don't think telegram, you know, and letters and stuff kind of, you know,

821
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:24,859
the,

822
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,339
that's not a real time thing

823
00:33:26,459 --> 00:33:29,130
that's only been around real and available to

824
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,810
people for like really less than 100 years.

825
00:33:31,819 --> 00:33:33,530
Like the majority of people

826
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:38,209
didn't have access to that stuff on the regular in a, in an affordable way.

827
00:33:38,219 --> 00:33:40,339
You know, I remember when phone calls, like local,

828
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:43,920
like I've lived in countries where local calls were charged by the minute.

829
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,569
Oh, man. I know.

830
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:49,099
And so I think part of it too is we've only like,

831
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:52,640
even in you, you read accounts of World War Two.

832
00:33:52,849 --> 00:33:55,869
You know, people were lucky to get one letter a month from home

833
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,489
or, you know, and people working together clearly, we're not, you know,

834
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,479
working together

835
00:34:00,699 --> 00:34:03,250
remotely like we can now.

836
00:34:03,699 --> 00:34:04,530
And so

837
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,969
we're, we're fighting thousands of years of,

838
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:12,530
of evolution and of cultural and social conditioning.

839
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:14,429
You know, my favorite thing is zoom fatigue and I,

840
00:34:14,438 --> 00:34:16,978
I firmly believe zoom fatigue is due to the fact

841
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:19,489
that your brain is desperately trying to read body language

842
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:22,350
-- off of a potato quality video.
-- Probably

843
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,159
I, I, yeah, I have no doubt.

844
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:27,330
And, and so it's hard and it's exhausting because you have to do things a new way.

845
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,010
You have to learn things a new way and you have to be very

846
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:33,489
explicit and you have to be very declarative. You have to,

847
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,649
you know,

848
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,879
nobody's gonna see you on a Zoom call and notice that you're kind

849
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:41,290
of slumped or feeling down whereas they would notice that immediately in person.

850
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,290
-- Yep,
-- it's true.

851
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,228
It's true.

852
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:48,129
And, and I guess on that note, no one noticing we're slumped or, or feeling down

853
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:48,870
is

854
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:50,250
it's time to end the show.

855
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:51,620

You too and remember to send out meeting agendas everybody.

863

Yeah, that's my number one pet peeve meetings with no agenda. What

864
00:35:09,879 --> 00:35:09,899
is

865
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,030
