Hello and welcome to episode 99 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,489 --> 00:00:11,949
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:12,409 --> 00:00:18,079
So, do you know the email address of a good GDPR consultant? I could get a hold of Kurt.

3
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:18,530
Yes,

4
00:00:18,729 --> 00:00:19,840
but I can't give it to you,

5
00:00:20,459 --> 00:00:20,850
but I'm,

6
00:00:23,049 --> 00:00:23,819
ah, ha ha

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:24,420
ha ha

8
00:00:24,549 --> 00:00:24,569
ha.

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,590
I'm shocked at apparently how many recruiting

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,229
companies have my information in Europe.

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,590
And I'm a little puzzled because

12
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,790
I haven't ever worked in Europe

13
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:39,319
-- or tried to work in Europe.
-- Doesn't matter.

14
00:00:39,419 --> 00:00:41,540
-- So, like,
-- welcome to

15
00:00:41,849 --> 00:00:45,090
-- the world.
-- Did they just scrape linkedin? I don't know.

16
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,180
I,

17
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:49,799
I imagine there are countless reasons

18
00:00:50,099 --> 00:00:51,759
that they have your information

19
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,599
and, and I guess this is, I mean, whatever,

20
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,169
it's good and funny enough this does tie in with,

21
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,950
with the topic for the day of consumer security is,

22
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:02,569
I mean, whether you're in Europe or not,

23
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,220
this is going to give consumers a certain level

24
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,269
of control over their data they've never had.

25
00:01:07,279 --> 00:01:09,720
And I will ignore the political discussion around it.

26
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:10,069
But I mean,

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,989
I think fundamentally this is not going to be a bad thing at the end of the day.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,430
I,

29
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:17,769
ok. I think it won't be a bad thing for consumers. I think it

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,750
is

31
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:23,250
going to be problematic for smaller firms, especially start ups,

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,580
largely because of the unknowns. Right. We, it hasn't settled down yet. Right.

33
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,029
We don't have precedent. We don't,

34
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:32,279
we don't actually know like how much and

35
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,519
how hard they're going to enforce certain things

36
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,019
and we don't.

37
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:41,809
But so here's kind of the one fundamental takeaway from all of this is

38
00:01:42,339 --> 00:01:44,500
in the context of something like GDPR.

39
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,099
They're not there to get you right.

40
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:50,959
This isn't like some, some court case where there's a winner and there's a loser.

41
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,500
You,

42
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,199
you have what is essentially the people who want to make sure GDPR gets

43
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:57,620
enforced and then there's the people who have to deal with it and,

44
00:01:57,629 --> 00:02:01,120
and the enforcers aren't looking to, like, put you out of business, right?

45
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:03,860
So you can talk to them and, and work through things.

46
00:02:04,309 --> 00:02:07,059
Yeah. No, it's, I'm curious to see all those two lawsuits against, what was it?

47
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:09,250
Facebook. And I want to

48
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,259
-- Google
-- for like $8 billion or

49
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,970
$10 times everybody in Europe.

50
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,169
So

51
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,949
we'll see. I don't know. I mean, as I think I,

52
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,690
II, I forget I was talking to somebody and I said, um,

53
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:25,720
this is probably going to end up being like a 175 year old fine and

54
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,309
they have to write an apology note on the back of the lunch menu.

55
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,039
That's, that's how these things.

56
00:02:30,429 --> 00:02:30,610
Well,

57
00:02:30,619 --> 00:02:33,029
I imagine Google for $8 billion are gonna throw a few

58
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:35,929
dollars at their lawyers to prevent that from being a thing.

59
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:40,259
-- Right.
-- Like, just, just make sure this court case takes 20 years or more. Right?

60
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:40,880
Like,

61
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,559
but by then this, this, this trust fund we set up to pay for, this should

62
00:02:46,089 --> 00:02:46,149
pretty

63
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:46,729
much

64
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:49,720
-- $8 billion.
-- Yeah.

65
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,539
Yeah, that's pretty wild.

66
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:52,490
So,

67
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:56,460
anyway, so you had an article about the FBI giving consumers?

68
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,539
I don't want to say advice.

69
00:02:59,039 --> 00:02:59,869
My goodness.

70
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,990
I don't even know what to call it. So

71
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:07,910
there's apparently malware on 500,000 routers

72
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:11,399
that I think Talis found. I think it was the Cisco

73
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,369
Tali guys.

74
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:17,429
Anyway, that's where I saw the report first and, and basically the FBI told people

75
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,750
if you own like, one of these specific routers reboot it.

76
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,779
And I'm like,

77
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:27,339
man, that is just terrible advice because let's face it.

78
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:30,080
Most people probably don't know, they own one of these routers.

79
00:03:30,089 --> 00:03:31,699
They don't have a good way to find out

80
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:36,460
and let's face it, telling them to read. Do they know how to reboot the router?

81
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:41,110
-- Well, you unplug it and plug it back in.
-- Do they know that? I mean,

82
00:03:41,869 --> 00:03:43,539
I, I feel like

83
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,289
as a consumer,

84
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,960
if I was a normal person,

85
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:48,929
I would have no idea what to do

86
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:52,649
like ever. Right. What, what is, what is the purpose of this advice?

87
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,949
Why am I rebooting my router. Why does it matter? Does it affect me in any way?

88
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,929
And let's face it for the vast majority of them.

89
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:58,880
They,

90
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:01,289
they don't even know their router has been infected with malware and

91
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,279
it probably doesn't affect them in a super huge negative manner.

92
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:04,820
Right.

93
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,740
And not only that you're going to reboot the thing

94
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,979
and it's almost certainly going to get re hacked.

95
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,479
I, I actually just, uh, have been cleaning out some old, uh, it gear and, uh,

96
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,858
came across three of my wireless, old wireless routers.

97
00:04:16,869 --> 00:04:19,309
A Cisco E 2300, 2500 and a,

98
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:20,100
I think, a

99
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,040
Dlin something or other.

100
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,079
And the Ciscos have like DDW RT on them because that's by

101
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:26,959
far the most recent thing that you can get for them.

102
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,170
And it's from like,

103
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,040
it's,

104
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,279
it's over five years old at this point. The software. Right.

105
00:04:32,809 --> 00:04:33,679
And then

106
00:04:33,989 --> 00:04:34,690
I think it was, the D

107
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:38,910
link has whatever D link software on it. And it's from like 2015

108
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,630
and there's no updates available,

109
00:04:40,859 --> 00:04:43,070
you know, and that's just kind of the reality.

110
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,079
I'm, I'm sure it's fine.

111
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:49,149
Well, the channel, I think part of the problem is like most of these devices get,

112
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,230
what about maybe 1 to 3 years of support from the vendor if you're lucky,

113
00:04:53,529 --> 00:04:54,910
you know, that seems to be

114
00:04:55,109 --> 00:04:55,670
maybe, but

115
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,510
realistically a wireless router can run for 1020 years.

116
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,010
Well,

117
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:02,309
but here's the more important thing is even

118
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,720
if the manufacturer is supporting it for,

119
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,890
let's say, five years.

120
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:08,940
And I think that's generous in a lot of cases. But let's say it's five years.

121
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,730
-- How many normal people ever update their
-- firm.

122
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,799
Exactly. Yeah. Unless it happens automatically.

123
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,359
And then I'm thinking of, you know, like my, my, uh,

124
00:05:16,369 --> 00:05:19,049
fiber link and my cable modem link.

125
00:05:19,059 --> 00:05:20,059
You know, I have

126
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:20,250
a,

127
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,040
a modem from the ISP now that I think about it,

128
00:05:23,049 --> 00:05:25,630
I've never updated them and I'm not even sure I can,

129
00:05:25,929 --> 00:05:28,109
uh the ISP stuff should take care of itself.

130
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,119
It's, well, I don't know,

131
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,850
in Canada it's a little different because I do have the administrative login

132
00:05:31,859 --> 00:05:33,989
to it and I can monkey with all the settings I want.

133
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,239
But

134
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,679
I, now that I think about it, I've never looked for an OS update.

135
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:43,160
Uh because quite honestly, my strategy is, is, well, you know,

136
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,720
um what is Google's thing beyond

137
00:05:45,049 --> 00:05:46,029
uh beyond Corp

138
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:49,299
because the reality is like, it frustrates me,

139
00:05:49,309 --> 00:05:52,079
the people that do spend a lot of time and effort securing their home network.

140
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:54,029
And I'm like, that's awesome. That's cool. You, do you,

141
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,910
do you ever take your laptop to a coffee shop?

142
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,670
And they're like, yeah, and I'm like, awesome. So, like, how do you, you know?

143
00:06:00,179 --> 00:06:00,890
Right. Like,

144
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:04,269
yeah, exactly. So, I mean, at home it's just like everything is

145
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,920
essentially its own little

146
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:07,570
island fortress because

147
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,829
this, everything's mobile now I'm actually getting rid of.

148
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:14,579
I have one desktop computer that I'm getting rid of.

149
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,290
And so with, you know, basically everything I have now is mobile.

150
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,679
You know, and it moves around the house,

151
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,429
the coffee shop.

152
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,799
Yeah, for, as far as my, uh, my network gear goes. Yeah.

153
00:06:27,809 --> 00:06:30,920
I mean, I bought a PF Sense firewall mostly because

154
00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:33,459
the vendor does give updates to it.

155
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,320
It's like a general, you know, it's free BS D running firewall stuff.

156
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:39,589
So it'll basically get updates for a long, long time.

157
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,109
-- I thought
-- your firewall was gonna self destruct

158
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:44,190
at some point because of some Intel bug.

159
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:44,760
Right.

160
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:45,399
Right.

161
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,739
It's got that Intel chip that's got some wonky hardware issue that, yeah,

162
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,059
it's like the timing chip or something.

163
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,029
And so, yeah, if I,

164
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,980
if it runs for a long time and I reboot it, it just basically won't work and,

165
00:06:58,609 --> 00:07:02,390
well, I mean, let's face it. That's also true of every other piece of hardware I own.

166
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,790
Right. It may not work someday.

167
00:07:05,489 --> 00:07:06,290
It's a,

168
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:06,790
yeah,

169
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:10,760
you know, and I have a plan B, it's a Raspberry Pi with two network interfaces,

170
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:15,630
right. I'll just whip that in quickly and, you know, go buy another hardware device.

171
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:19,480
Um Although I'll probably just go with like a Google mesh router thing

172
00:07:19,489 --> 00:07:21,429
and get rid of all my network gear and just go to that.

173
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:29,230
I, I bought a Google device because I was so this was maybe a month ago.

174
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:31,429
I was incredibly ill.

175
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,089
It was shortly after Rs a, in fact, and I was like, bedridden sick

176
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:36,459
and the internet died.

177
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:39,470
And so I, like, I hold myself down in the basement and I,

178
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,309
I start checking things out and I plug the laptop

179
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,989
directly into the cable modem and everything is fine.

180
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,149
I plug the router in and nothing works. I'm like, the router is dead.

181
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,660
And so I, like, I tried to do some magic to resurrect it. Nothing worked.

182
00:07:52,359 --> 00:07:55,410
And so I'm like, I'm really sick and I don't care.

183
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,790
So I just went to Best Buy because I could drive there and I,

184
00:07:58,799 --> 00:08:01,529
I probably made 20 people sick on this trip.

185
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,089
But whatever and, and I just bought the Google stuff because I'm like,

186
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,290
this is cheap and I know it'll be easy to set up and I just want to go back to bed

187
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,269
and, yeah,

188
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,279
it took me maybe 10 minutes to set it up

189
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,459
and it's been working great and I'm quite pleased with it

190
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:14,160
and, and maybe Google is spying

191
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:14,339
on,

192
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:14,989
you

193
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:17,279
know, given the fact that I, I don't,

194
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,720
I don't trust anyone anymore and I pretend all

195
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,359
of my computers are on the public internet.

196
00:08:21,369 --> 00:08:22,420
So, like, whatever.

197
00:08:22,859 --> 00:08:23,619
Yeah. So,

198
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:27,649
yeah, I, I, the whole beyond Corp thing, it's, you know,

199
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,089
I think that's just the reality of it now,

200
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,579
especially with mobile devices like phones and tablets.

201
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:34,989
Well, not only that man, like, I don't even trust my ISP.

202
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:38,179
Right though. Those people are, are dirt bags, let's face it.

203
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,109
Well, they,

204
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,229
you know, my ISP, I mean, in Canada they're not quite as dirt baggy.

205
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:45,570
But, you know, if I mistype an address and I'm using their DNS

206
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:48,309
very helpfully sends me to their error page,

207
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:50,539
you know, which is not what I wanted.

208
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,989
-- Right. Right.
-- Exactly.

209
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:55,010
Right. Did you mean this page of ads?

210
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:56,909
Yeah.

211
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:59,919
So the deal, so as I understand it, the deal with this FBI thing is,

212
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:03,270
is they took over the command and control servers for this malware.

213
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,679
And that's why they're saying everybody reboot your router because

214
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,599
I don't, they just reboot them then.

215
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:09,239
Uh that's a good question.

216
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,409
And there's been a lot of discussion in the industry about this, about, you know,

217
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:16,119
kind of like how active can we be for?

218
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,760
Yeah, like dealing with malware.

219
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:22,190
Like, I mean, it's one thing, you know, it's OK from a spam point of view, for example,

220
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,599
it's

221
00:09:22,739 --> 00:09:25,380
definitely OK to say, hey, this IP address is spamming.

222
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,380
You know, if you want to blacklist it, go ahead and blacklist it. Right?

223
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,239
Because you're not touching the system in any way. Cool.

224
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:34,059
But you know, the minute you start to touch the system, even poking it with like

225
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,559
a scan or something, you, you really do open yourself up to some potential liability

226
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,369
and for all, you know, the system might.

227
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,900
I because I remember um oh jeez, what was his name?

228
00:09:43,909 --> 00:09:44,770
Dave,

229
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,510
the guy at University of Washington that did a

230
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,609
lot of denial service stuff like 20 years ago.

231
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,690
Um,

232
00:09:51,219 --> 00:09:54,570
and, and distributed denial service anyways, the point is he was like,

233
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,049
he was, like, back then he was like, the head it

234
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,450
Honcho to some degree for, like, University of Washington,

235
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,489
which has a very large medical center.

236
00:10:02,229 --> 00:10:03,190
And so they would have like,

237
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,739
malware or spam or something coming out of a machine and they'd be like, you know,

238
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,010
and everybody's like, cool, just shut it down.

239
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,869
He's like, yeah, no, that's like ac a scanner,

240
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,789
we can't do that without potentially killing people or,

241
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,429
you know, this like $5 million piece of machine is no longer available.

242
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,809
And if you tell him it's not available because you killed its network access

243
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,969
because of some malware.

244
00:10:21,979 --> 00:10:25,130
They're going to yell at you and then they're going to have a doctor yell at you,

245
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:26,770
you know.

246
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:29,320
So, yeah, I mean,

247
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,770
now in the case of these routers, it's

248
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:37,030
less likely that they're doing something life critical.

249
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:37,409
But, you know,

250
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:39,559
for all we know it's providing remote telemetry

251
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,619
access to like a remote oil field site.

252
00:10:41,859 --> 00:10:42,909
Like we don't know.

253
00:10:43,349 --> 00:10:44,219
No, I agree.

254
00:10:44,229 --> 00:10:49,200
I, you don't know what's going on and I think rebooting them is, or, or, I mean, let's,

255
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,979
let's put our, our tinfoil hats on even, let's say

256
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,369
the FBI reboots all the routers.

257
00:10:55,469 --> 00:10:58,559
What if one of them is in the middle of like a 911 call,

258
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:59,119
right?

259
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:04,539
Like, like there's I, I understand why you don't want to just magically do this

260
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,669
and realistically to the downside is one of those kind of classic, you know,

261
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:11,809
it's like people who don't cover their nose when they sneeze in public.

262
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:16,090
Yeah, it really sucks. And other people get sick but probably almost nobody dies.

263
00:11:16,099 --> 00:11:16,849
Or if they do the,

264
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:20,250
the, the responsibility is quite diffuse, you know?

265
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,390
And so,

266
00:11:22,109 --> 00:11:22,679
yeah, I mean,

267
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,909
it's really unlikely that rebooting 500,000 routers

268
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,409
is going to actually kill somebody.

269
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:26,919
But,

270
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:29,270
but right,

271
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:32,419
you end up in, it's one of those things that ends up in the news,

272
00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:35,580
you know, it's like the self driving cars,

273
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:37,739
will they statistically be better than people?

274
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,020
Uh My understanding is right now,

275
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,719
we don't actually know somebody posted on reddit actually a really good

276
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:47,020
analysis of the number of accidents and whatnot per mile driven.

277
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,119
Um,

278
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:49,719
and I think maybe part of the problem right

279
00:11:49,729 --> 00:11:52,380
now is we have actually relatively very little data,

280
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:52,599
right?

281
00:11:52,609 --> 00:11:57,650
We only have several millions or tens of millions of miles of autonomously driven

282
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:58,500
cars.

283
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:00,000
And one could argue even that,

284
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,030
that they're not truly autonomous because like they're, they're,

285
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:04,140
these systems are built with the idea of not warning

286
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,539
the human to jump in when there's a problem,

287
00:12:05,549 --> 00:12:07,390
but the human is somehow expected to do that

288
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,909
as we covered in the last episode. But, um,

289
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:15,460
yeah, I mean, we just don't really have enough data yet to truly say, are you know,

290
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:17,979
autonomously driven cars better than people.

291
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,729
But I think what we can safely say is, you know,

292
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,849
people have pretty much peaked at how good they're going to get with driving.

293
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,849
That's it. Right.

294
00:12:24,859 --> 00:12:28,219
Like without, without computer assistant, like lane keeping and parallel,

295
00:12:28,229 --> 00:12:30,229
like most people can't parallel park.

296
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,780
Like, every time I see one of those, like, here's the secret,

297
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,919
well, here's the secret to parallel parking and I'm like, that's not the secret.

298
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:37,919
-- That's just how you parallel park.
-- No,

299
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:39,580
the secret is, don't do it.

300
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,979
And in effect, so funny enough when,

301
00:12:40,989 --> 00:12:44,229
when I got my driver's license because in the United States they give you this, like,

302
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:45,460
comically simple test

303
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,739
and the only thing I failed on was parallel parking. I

304
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,289
can't, I can't parallel park

305
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:52,419
in fairness.

306
00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:56,530
I failed my first driving exam due to, I made an error while parallel parking.

307
00:12:56,539 --> 00:12:58,849
It was in winter and there was enough snow on the road ramping

308
00:12:58,859 --> 00:13:01,320
up to the sidewalk that I ended up like an inch on the sidewalk

309
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,130
because I just couldn't tell where the curb was. Right, because there's,

310
00:13:04,469 --> 00:13:04,869
you know,

311
00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:09,210
uh, our, our side roads here just are like, they, they try to blade them down.

312
00:13:09,219 --> 00:13:11,969
So there's like, four inches or less of ice and snow.

313
00:13:12,169 --> 00:13:14,640
But anyways, yeah, I mean, it, so

314
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,809
humans have peaked as far as driving ability goes without

315
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:19,530
computerized assistance.

316
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:22,289
Like lane keeping and like, oh my God, that thing in front of you just stop moving.

317
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:23,359
So I'm going to hit the brakes,

318
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:24,330
you know.

319
00:13:25,219 --> 00:13:27,549
And so the reality is computers are going to get

320
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:30,000
better and better at it and will they surpass humans?

321
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:30,440
Oh, yeah.

322
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:33,520
Yeah. And, and clearly not very long from now,

323
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,200
you know, um, especially like, you know, yesterday again,

324
00:13:37,369 --> 00:13:41,599
driving and this lady next to me kept, like, was texting while, you know,

325
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,049
driving and making a left turn and it's just like, oh, good Lord, you know,

326
00:13:46,369 --> 00:13:47,989
please let there be no pedestrians.

327
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,000
So,

328
00:13:49,309 --> 00:13:53,000
yeah, the problem is whenever you take an active measure,

329
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:57,640
you know, and, and then the other problem becomes like, how active. Ok, is a reboot?

330
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:57,919
Ok.

331
00:13:57,929 --> 00:14:01,859
Well, a reboot is probably non destructive and it's, you know, it's,

332
00:14:01,869 --> 00:14:02,739
it's a good intention.

333
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,890
So, ok, we'll allow reboots. Well, what about a software update?

334
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,859
What about a software?

335
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:12,140
Uh What about removing a piece of functionality that probably almost nobody uses,

336
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,320
like, say UPNP

337
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:14,479
like, you know,

338
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,390
where do you draw that line of like, oh, well, maybe, you know,

339
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,979
this device will never get an update again.

340
00:14:18,989 --> 00:14:21,099
Maybe we should just remotely brick them all

341
00:14:21,369 --> 00:14:22,940
and force people to buy new devices.

342
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,799
You know, where do you draw that line?

343
00:14:25,109 --> 00:14:26,840
-- Right.
-- It's tricky.

344
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:32,080
Well, what about people who have, say, cell phones or tablets that

345
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:36,299
the CS cellular carrier knows is compromised? What do you do with that?

346
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:39,039
Do you cut it off from the network? Do you break it? Do you

347
00:14:39,229 --> 00:14:40,559
-- remember
-- when the

348
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:41,039
I, this

349
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:42,210
is like 20 years ago,

350
00:14:42,219 --> 00:14:45,760
the ISP used to allow outgoing port 25 like you could run your own mail server at home,

351
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,549
obviously that stopped

352
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:51,869
and, you know, now they block outgoing to port 25 except on business accounts,

353
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:54,809
you know, and you certainly can't run a server locally.

354
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:57,130
Um They had the same problem with, um,

355
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:57,700
with

356
00:14:57,859 --> 00:14:59,109
Samba traffic.

357
00:14:59,119 --> 00:15:00,549
Uh And the problem was these infected

358
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:02,979
machines were generating so much traffic on their

359
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,179
local area networks.

360
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,299
And when I say local area network, I mean,

361
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,859
these machines were jacked straight into the internet.

362
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:08,849
So this is like the, is P's local area network

363
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,309
that they were bringing down entire neighborhoods, right?

364
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,150
Like the neighborhood node would get flooded with this traffic

365
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,619
and yeah, like an entire, you know, several square blocks would like,

366
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:22,289
basically their internet speed would go to like 0.1.

367
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:25,700
And so they started blocking that, you know, so my ISP

368
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:28,179
uh probably 1520 years ago, you know,

369
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:33,059
was blocking ports. Uh I want to say like 1 35 1 37 1 38 1 39.

370
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,179
And, and for what it's worth,

371
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:39,039
I totally agree with this sort of behavior and I know we kind of touched on

372
00:15:39,049 --> 00:15:41,010
this when we argued net neutrality and you

373
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,419
totally convinced me that net neutrality is dumb.

374
00:15:43,429 --> 00:15:44,460
But that's another story.

375
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:45,679
I,

376
00:15:45,849 --> 00:15:47,200
I don't believe that really,

377
00:15:47,429 --> 00:15:53,280
but uh I, I am not opposed to organizations taking certain actions against

378
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,679
known bad

379
00:15:54,849 --> 00:15:58,989
devices and, or behavior just because I feel like,

380
00:15:59,099 --> 00:16:00,559
you know what I would compare this to,

381
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,419
let's say you go into the hospital and you're like,

382
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,619
I have this cough and it won't go away and they say,

383
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,580
oh you have Ebola get in this bubble and stay in there, right?

384
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,270
You can't, you can't say I'm gonna go home. They

385
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,700
like, no, you're not get in the room, right?

386
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:12,900
And,

387
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:14,429
and I feel like some of this is kind of

388
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,020
like that where you have that public health aspect of it

389
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,700
and there's also secure ways to do this, right. VPN S are not

390
00:16:20,869 --> 00:16:23,299
magic anymore. They're actually

391
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,979
available by default on. I think virtually every device.

392
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:31,510
Why are you, why is a VPN a solution?

393
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,340
What?

394
00:16:32,989 --> 00:16:33,830
Well, for example,

395
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,809
if you do need to remotely access Samba on your machine at home or something goofy,

396
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:38,609
right?

397
00:16:38,909 --> 00:16:39,450
Or,

398
00:16:40,859 --> 00:16:42,020
or you can have your GP N

399
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,159
you know, like

400
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:46,909
D DNS style provider that then you know, you can connect it to it on the internet,

401
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:47,260
right?

402
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:51,840
Like these services cost like literally, I think three or $4 a month now.

403
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:52,609
Uh

404
00:16:52,739 --> 00:16:54,169
Yeah, I mean, look,

405
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:56,340
you don't even need any of that. Let's face it.

406
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,419
The only reason people even set up a lot of this

407
00:16:58,429 --> 00:17:01,940
stuff was for sharing files and there's so many services today.

408
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:02,219
I mean,

409
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:07,140
I think the cloud solves a lot of the problems we were trying to homebrew ourselves

410
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:11,010
and we've reached a point where you have to say, like, don't, don't do that.

411
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,959
I mean, it's like running an email server for less than a few 1000 people.

412
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:14,598
No,

413
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:19,569
I would argue running an email server for more than a few 1000 people.

414
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:20,040
Well,

415
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,368
at least at that point you get to certain

416
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,608
economies of scale where it might make sense.

417
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:24,729
But, you know,

418
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:27,670
I used to run my own mail servers and it was like a minimum one or two hours a week,

419
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,530
just dealing with spam and anti spam and all that junk.

420
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:31,469
You know,

421
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:33,609
it was a

422
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:33,790
part

423
00:17:34,439 --> 00:17:34,729
that's over

424
00:17:34,849 --> 00:17:35,000
with.

425
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,089
But, yeah, so I think,

426
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,250
yeah, you know, where do we draw that line of,

427
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,930
what sort of corrective action can we take or

428
00:17:39,939 --> 00:17:42,560
do we just ideally have them notify everybody in,

429
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:42,680
in?

430
00:17:42,689 --> 00:17:43,670
Of course,

431
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,140
you and I have heard about this, but I'm,

432
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:50,180
I'm 100% betting if we asked 100 people on the street,

433
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:52,949
one of them might know what a router is.

434
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:58,609
And actually, you know what's really funny about that? You even say? So,

435
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:03,790
uh, my dad calls me maybe a month ago. It was, it was just after, was it?

436
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,609
No, it was just before I got really sick

437
00:18:06,109 --> 00:18:08,119
and he says my internet is really slow and I'm like, oh,

438
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,760
you have a virus probably again.

439
00:18:10,109 --> 00:18:13,209
So I go over to his house and I check his computer seems to be fine.

440
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,930
And so I, I did some tests of the network where I had my own gear.

441
00:18:17,939 --> 00:18:21,219
So, of course, I plugged things in and I'm testing and I said your router shot you.

442
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,199
If I take the router off, I was getting

443
00:18:24,489 --> 00:18:27,319
like, whatever, I'm supposed to get 100 megabits, whatever.

444
00:18:27,569 --> 00:18:29,680
And when I plug the router in, I was getting four

445
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,880
and I'm like,

446
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,280
something's wrong, you know, you need a new router

447
00:18:33,489 --> 00:18:34,959
and this has been over a month

448
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:37,040
and I was there this weekend

449
00:18:37,209 --> 00:18:40,800
and I said, did you get a new router? He said, oh, no, I just haven't had time.

450
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:41,589
And I'm thinking,

451
00:18:41,989 --> 00:18:44,310
I wish I lived a life where my internet could

452
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:47,280
be four megabits and I don't care for a month.

453
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:49,689
You know,

454
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,270
-- it's
-- just

455
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,640
the majority of people like they,

456
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,449
-- they need it for
-- Netflix.

457
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,060
No, that's straight up it.

458
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,969
That's the only reason they need anything more than about a megabit per second.

459
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:06,810
And it's funny you say that because his Netflix looks really bad when he was playing.

460
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,369
I'm like, go get a router.

461
00:19:09,739 --> 00:19:09,890
Yeah,

462
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,430
that's the only reason my partner's parents

463
00:19:11,439 --> 00:19:12,829
upgraded their internet is because they're like,

464
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:16,880
why does our Netflix look so, you know, terrible compared to everyone else's.

465
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:17,430
And we're like,

466
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:21,640
because you have the $15 a month internet plan bit.

467
00:19:22,109 --> 00:19:22,969
That's why

468
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,609
it was literally like one, it was, what was it?

469
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:31,369
It was like 0.3 or four and five megabits down or something like it was.

470
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:31,979
Yeah.

471
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:32,819
So,

472
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:36,130
so anyway, all right, we're in the weeds, we're in the weeds.

473
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,430
Normal people with security

474
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:39,510
there is.

475
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,729
I feel like there's no hope in educating them.

476
00:19:42,739 --> 00:19:46,229
I think the FBI asking people to do this is a waste of their time.

477
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:50,459
I, I don't even know why they would do that. It, it is. No, it doesn't matter. Right.

478
00:19:50,469 --> 00:19:51,319
It's not gonna work

479
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,979
and I don't know what the answer is like.

480
00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:54,349
Should the I SPS have all the, you know,

481
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,640
on premises equipment and manage it remotely?

482
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,959
Uh, I'm not sure. I like that answer either.

483
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,979
Yeah. So I, I hate that answer.

484
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:07,500
Well, speaking of that cesspool, the whole dot app domain cesspool thing.

485
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,719
So, yeah.

486
00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:09,869
So for those of you that don't know,

487
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,979
Google created a top level domain called dot app like dot A PP.

488
00:20:14,739 --> 00:20:16,800
Um, for apps,

489
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:21,719
right? It's like the go to place for your apps. You know, I was on,

490
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:25,079
what was I doing? I was

491
00:20:25,469 --> 00:20:28,319
on youtube or something. Anyways. Long story short,

492
00:20:29,109 --> 00:20:30,119
uh, Fortnite,

493
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,219
very popular game right now amongst the young people.

494
00:20:33,589 --> 00:20:35,300
And this guy straight up had a video on

495
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,689
youtube basically saying you can get Fortnite for Android,

496
00:20:37,699 --> 00:20:39,089
which by the way, you can't

497
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,699
like, it does not exist

498
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:42,949
and he's like you download, go to this, uh,

499
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:48,750
it's like Fortnite something Android dot A PP, you know, install this thing,

500
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,170
you know, disable the warnings.

501
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:50,729
Yeah. You.

502
00:20:50,739 --> 00:20:54,489
He's like, you might get a warning about an unsigned app, just bypass it this way,

503
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,489
blah, blah, blah.

504
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,719
And then he's like,

505
00:20:56,729 --> 00:21:00,449
and then the app will take you to a website where you'll have to install

506
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:04,099
like two bonus apps that you have to like play a little bit before,

507
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:05,640
you know, it'll unlock Fortnite.

508
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:07,300
So it's basically,

509
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,010
it's an installer that then gets you to install like two random

510
00:21:11,589 --> 00:21:15,900
other game apps. And, and the funniest thing is like, one was a clear rip off of um

511
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:19,099
like Clash of Clans or something. It was one of those, you know, like little

512
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,959
RT S sword Castle

513
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:22,709
jiggers

514
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:23,939
and he's like,

515
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,349
you might have to play for a little while or you

516
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:26,890
might have to play for a longer while before it,

517
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,089
like unlocks for you.

518
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,780
And it's like straight up,

519
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:33,790
I'm assuming it's like affiliate scams,

520
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:34,709
you know, like

521
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:38,739
where you get paid to get people to install the apps and use it

522
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:40,260
because I'm assuming,

523
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,150
or the app and

524
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:42,599
the

525
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:42,800
app,

526
00:21:42,819 --> 00:21:44,449
people are hoping that the people will install the

527
00:21:44,459 --> 00:21:46,020
app and actually enjoy it and keep it and

528
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,910
pay for microtransaction junk inside of it.

529
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:51,670
But you think they'd probably be smart enough to realize that that's,

530
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,829
that I imagine it's like one in a million

531
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,270
when it comes to that, you know, for installs actually being monetized.

532
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:58,699
Um

533
00:21:59,469 --> 00:22:02,209
But yeah, I mean, this, this thing is on youtube, it's a clear scam,

534
00:22:02,219 --> 00:22:03,949
like 100% scam and, you know.

535
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:05,890
Yeah, youtube has no problem with it. And

536
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,569
the dot App

537
00:22:07,699 --> 00:22:10,449
domain is, you know, full of this garbage.

538
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,689
Uh, so the, the video you linked to on youtube appears to be gone.

539
00:22:15,589 --> 00:22:16,349
I have a feeling.

540
00:22:16,459 --> 00:22:18,449
Yeah, they, they, they must have taken it down.

541
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,099
Hm.

542
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,060
One down a million to go.

543
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,709
No, but again, we, we come back to

544
00:22:26,969 --> 00:22:29,979
what did, what do normal people do about this kind of stuff?

545
00:22:29,989 --> 00:22:33,239
How would a normal person know that's a scam? Right.

546
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:34,550
Yeah, exactly.

547
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,630
Well, it reminds me of the,

548
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,790
I believe dot Bank is a top level domain and the idea was like, oh,

549
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,530
only real banks can level for, can, you know,

550
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,050
can apply or get dot Bank. And I'm like, no, like

551
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,670
no,

552
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,459
there's like 100 and 80 countries and some of

553
00:22:48,469 --> 00:22:50,910
them have some really lax rules around banking.

554
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,949
-- I wonder if we could start a bank and get a dot Bank.
-- Don.

555
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:54,969
I looked into it uh,

556
00:22:54,979 --> 00:22:57,920
to start a bank depending on where you want to go and what kind of bank you want to be?

557
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,640
You're looking at about 10 to 100 rand.

558
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,319
-- Oh,
-- the bare minimal.

559
00:23:01,459 --> 00:23:04,010
Really? That seems remarkably affordable.

560
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,410
Well, this isn't like you're doing it properly.

561
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:09,719
This is like,

562
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:13,359
this is like, I'm a car mechanic. I have like a hammer and a screwdriver

563
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,189
to, it's legit, yo

564
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:16,099
to,

565
00:23:16,219 --> 00:23:16,979
it's legit.

566
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,300
Yes. And then we could offer 10% interest on investments

567
00:23:22,459 --> 00:23:22,839
and no,

568
00:23:22,939 --> 00:23:23,030
no,

569
00:23:24,449 --> 00:23:28,530
no, 10% interest people. Here, here's how it works. You offer 10% interest.

570
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,040
People invest massively their money because they want

571
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,099
their 10% interest in days when you're anyone,

572
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:36,349
then you, you take that money and invest it in Bitcoin

573
00:23:36,729 --> 00:23:40,300
and then you either become filthy rich or everything fails and then you

574
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,989
just declare bankruptcy and say you had no idea this wouldn't work.

575
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,670
Right. Totally checks up.

576
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,689
See, the reason I would never do this is it's,

577
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,119
is it's actually illegal to do this kind of stuff.

578
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:52,250
Whereas for example, having a Kickstarter and spending all the money on like

579
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:55,869
whatever lifestyle stuff is actually legal.

580
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:58,069
You, you're probably, you're sadly correct.

581
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:58,500
So,

582
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,089
you know,

583
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:02,324
that's the beauty of most white collar crime is there's

584
00:24:02,334 --> 00:24:04,295
a whole bunch of stuff that isn't white collar crime.

585
00:24:04,604 --> 00:24:09,944
It's perfectly legal. It's just really morally and ethically not so cool.

586
00:24:10,454 --> 00:24:15,214
And we're again back to the place where, how do normal people know what's going on?

587
00:24:15,224 --> 00:24:16,915
-- Simple
-- if it sounds too good to be true.

588
00:24:16,925 --> 00:24:18,364
It is. Well, ok, there's that.

589
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:21,324
Yes, but here's whatever that doesn't work either.

590
00:24:21,415 --> 00:24:22,114
So, so here's,

591
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:24,775
let's use banking as our example because it would be totally

592
00:24:24,785 --> 00:24:27,574
illegal if you and I just did the insane thing I suggested

593
00:24:27,704 --> 00:24:28,094
and

594
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,910
it is illegal and there are regulators

595
00:24:31,689 --> 00:24:33,219
who help prevent this because.

596
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,979
Right. Right. I mean, let's face it.

597
00:24:34,989 --> 00:24:38,790
If, if anyone could do this, everyone would do this. Right. Let's face.

598
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,199
I mean, that's just the reality of it.

599
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,069
Well, yeah. And I mean, Bernie Madoff did it and made

600
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,959
and that didn't end very well for him though.

601
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,680
And, and so here, here's the thing. Right.

602
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:51,079
And here's something I always think about.

603
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:53,000
I know we've talked about this more than once is,

604
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,790
can you regulate tech?

605
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,459
And the answer so far has been no.

606
00:24:59,229 --> 00:25:01,609
And there's a variety of reasons for that.

607
00:25:01,979 --> 00:25:04,780
Yeah, I think part of the problem too is how do we regulate tech?

608
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:09,130
Like, do we need to be prescriptive or, like, sort of descriptive or?

609
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:11,089
No, we can't be prescriptive.

610
00:25:11,099 --> 00:25:11,969
I mean, that, that's why,

611
00:25:11,979 --> 00:25:15,770
that's why the GDPR is so loosely defined because they know if they,

612
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,020
if they have specifics,

613
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:20,209
the first thing that happens is everyone just goes around them and now,

614
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:24,579
like the whole world of tech has shifted in crazy ways just to avoid GDPR.

615
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:24,849
Right.

616
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:28,589
Yeah, I, that's, yeah, I know, I've been thinking about this a lot and I, I

617
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,319
think realistically

618
00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:33,800
it has to be demand driven because supply, nobody cares.

619
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:38,300
And until like a ton of people die as people are starting to point out,

620
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,839
you know, on Twitter and whatnot.

621
00:25:40,099 --> 00:25:42,939
Right. And, and it's, it's multifaceted though there.

622
00:25:42,949 --> 00:25:45,630
So, actually this is interesting, let's talk about this for a second.

623
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,760
So I see two ways. Right. There's number one,

624
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
there's economic incentives

625
00:25:50,229 --> 00:25:50,939
where

626
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,800
it just, it, it is more economical to do something in a certain way.

627
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,459
And I think in, in the world of it, I don't know if we'll ever get there,

628
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:01,939
like an example of being cars. Right.

629
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:05,109
They don't build safer cars because it's economically viable.

630
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:07,739
They build safer cars because someone's telling them to do it.

631
00:26:07,939 --> 00:26:09,819
-- But,
-- I mean, with, it has to be demand driven.

632
00:26:09,829 --> 00:26:12,979
-- I mean, it's, it's,
-- uh, yes, well, sort of, sort of hang on

633
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,869
and we'll use cars as our example where

634
00:26:15,969 --> 00:26:18,619
the automobile industry used to be really unsafe.

635
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:21,939
And when they said every car has to have seat belts, everyone was like,

636
00:26:21,949 --> 00:26:23,599
oh my goodness, we can't possibly do that.

637
00:26:23,609 --> 00:26:24,780
We're all going to go out of business.

638
00:26:25,609 --> 00:26:26,270
And then

639
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,709
eventually

640
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:30,150
the, I don't even know which group it was that,

641
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,390
that told the cars they have to all have seat belts,

642
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,270
they did it.

643
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,510
I'm sure some may have gone out of business, but fundamentally speaking,

644
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,510
nobody really did.

645
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:38,910
And now,

646
00:26:39,329 --> 00:26:42,170
now we have various safety features that are being,

647
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,589
I, I wouldn't even say they demand generated, right?

648
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:49,859
It's, it's more like you have organizations saying if you don't do this,

649
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:51,550
you can't sell cars

650
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:54,579
-- and, and like in our world who's doing that
-- well, and,

651
00:26:54,589 --> 00:26:56,300
and part of the challenge with that,

652
00:26:56,550 --> 00:27:00,000
well, part of the challenge is software and it is changing so much like,

653
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:01,699
uh 10 years ago we didn't have

654
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:02,180
or,

655
00:27:02,369 --> 00:27:02,640
or

656
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:04,089
devices, man.

657
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:06,160
Well, yeah, I was just gonna say smartphones,

658
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:09,420
you know, we kind of had semi smartphones but nothing like what we have now.

659
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:09,930
And that's

660
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:10,910
in 10 years,

661
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,479
we've gone from zero to literally everybody having

662
00:27:13,489 --> 00:27:14,849
a smartphone except for a few people with

663
00:27:15,109 --> 00:27:18,420
-- phones. But
-- now, now here's, here's the other side of that.

664
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,739
So in the automobile industry,

665
00:27:21,459 --> 00:27:22,349
literally

666
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,229
millions of people have been killed.

667
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:25,089
Right.

668
00:27:25,099 --> 00:27:28,800
And, and before the safety, if we didn't have the safety measures, it would be much,

669
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:29,989
much higher than it is today.

670
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,189
And I, I read somewhere, I'll see if I can look this up.

671
00:27:32,199 --> 00:27:33,989
I think it's actually, uh, you know what,

672
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,270
I think it's actually has to be worse than that.

673
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,979
It's, it's not even that millions of people were killed in automobile accidents.

674
00:27:39,989 --> 00:27:43,260
It's that many, many more people were maimed and strangled

675
00:27:43,589 --> 00:27:44,010
and,

676
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:48,329
and lived and I think in a way that's almost more powerful because, you know,

677
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:50,130
honestly dead people don't complain that much.

678
00:27:50,459 --> 00:27:52,130
-- Well,
-- they have families and stuff,

679
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:55,569
their, their relatives and their friends do. Right.

680
00:27:55,739 --> 00:27:58,469
But having somebody, you know who's been mangled in a car accident,

681
00:27:58,479 --> 00:27:59,810
they're probably going to hold a grudge.

682
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:03,130
I, I feel like part of the challenge with it is that, you know,

683
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,290
luckily we very rarely kill and, or maim and mangle people.

684
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:08,010
Exactly. That's exactly it.

685
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:09,430
You know, which is good.

686
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:12,469
But the problem is, you know, it, I mean,

687
00:28:12,479 --> 00:28:15,689
airline disasters are a great example of this because they're just so,

688
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,459
you know, horrendous, like several 100 people just died, you know, horrendously

689
00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:23,479
that, yeah, we get it. That's a problem, you know. But like,

690
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:24,550
you know, we, we,

691
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,280
we already have instances of these A I and ML systems where it's like, clearly, oh,

692
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,989
you know, these things were, um, what was it, like,

693
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:35,219
incorrectly rating, um, parolees for the, the, the chance of them

694
00:28:35,369 --> 00:28:36,319
reoffending whatever.

695
00:28:36,329 --> 00:28:37,670
So these people are not being given parole

696
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,219
and they probably should have been given parole.

697
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:42,300
That, that's actually a pretty significant effect on these people's lives.

698
00:28:42,469 --> 00:28:46,329
But how, how do we quantify that? How do we measure that? You know,

699
00:28:46,579 --> 00:28:50,579
how do we do A B testing to actually see what the case is?

700
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,290
Well, look, let's face it.

701
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:56,359
That's a bad example because the vast majority of the public isn't gonna care.

702
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,160
Right.

703
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,400
Yeah. Well, and that too. Exactly. And,

704
00:28:59,569 --> 00:29:02,400
and that's a lot of it like, oh, you know, some, a bunch of people didn't get

705
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:07,000
loans. So, what, because, you know, the risk profile said they were a bad risk.

706
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,800
Yeah, exactly. How do we, how do we sort of sell that as a problem to people?

707
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:11,599
You know,

708
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,869
it's really hard to say, you know,

709
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,900
statistically 0.0 0.0 0.31% of people who

710
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:20,140
are left handed were improperly denied loans.

711
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,130
Yeah, nobody cares. Except for maybe you,

712
00:29:22,349 --> 00:29:25,560
I'm, I'm left handed. Yeah, that would be, that's a travesty.

713
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:25,930
I

714
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:26,920
have to care now.

715
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:27,770
Yeah,

716
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,560
I realistically think that,

717
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:32,949
I don't think software will ever make it bad enough that, like,

718
00:29:32,959 --> 00:29:36,900
cars or like mining or air travel.

719
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:39,390
Well, that's, that's the question. Right.

720
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,199
I mean, that's really,

721
00:29:40,209 --> 00:29:44,079
that's what it's going to come down to as far as consumer security is concerned.

722
00:29:44,089 --> 00:29:44,560
Is,

723
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:47,680
are we ever going to hit a point where

724
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,119
people care enough

725
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:52,199
to make something change? And if, if I had to guess

726
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:56,280
I don't see anything in the next five years that's gonna drive that

727
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,589
we might see certain things and let's say like the

728
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:01,609
medical device community where like people will literally die.

729
00:30:01,989 --> 00:30:02,530
But,

730
00:30:02,849 --> 00:30:04,689
but even then

731
00:30:04,939 --> 00:30:09,010
I don't know how much that's going to affect the greater ecosystem

732
00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:09,969
that, that

733
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:15,369
we call software and cloud and, and mobile devices and all this stuff. Right.

734
00:30:15,709 --> 00:30:18,689
I, I don't think it will because you look at all these data breaches.

735
00:30:18,699 --> 00:30:19,660
I still shop at Home Depot.

736
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:20,969
I don't even care.

737
00:30:21,349 --> 00:30:23,770
My credit card's been stolen so many times.

738
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,130
I just,

739
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:27,770
I have like alert fatigue on stolen credit cards and I just don't care anymore.

740
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,199
I mean, that's the reality of it and I'm a security guy.

741
00:30:30,699 --> 00:30:34,209
Well, realistically, what can we do? So, as far as consumers though, I think, um

742
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,650
I think part of what might help is if people, you know,

743
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:41,910
I hate to say this but you know, replace their devices every 3 to 5 years.

744
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,689
But I mean, if the thing still works, why spend money on that

745
00:30:44,829 --> 00:30:46,569
on, you know, this nebulous,

746
00:30:46,829 --> 00:30:49,290
slightly lower risk profile because you're getting soft.

747
00:30:49,609 --> 00:30:51,010
That's a really interesting question.

748
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,209
I wonder if you're say using an outdate android phone.

749
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:58,219
What, what the odds of actually getting infected by malware are

750
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,060
if you, if you're just using it? Right.

751
00:31:00,069 --> 00:31:03,449
I don't mean like trying to download Fortnite for, for Android.

752
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:04,339
Which funny

753
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,180
that you say that I didn't really Fortnite wasn't on Android

754
00:31:07,189 --> 00:31:09,030
and my kids were talking about putting it on Android.

755
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,579
So I need to actually go check that out after we, we stopped talking.

756
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:12,369
But um,

757
00:31:12,469 --> 00:31:13,680
but anyway, like,

758
00:31:13,689 --> 00:31:17,280
I wonder if you'd say just like checking email and maybe using Twitter

759
00:31:17,689 --> 00:31:21,439
on an outdated device versus a brand new device.

760
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,229
I would say if you're using a,

761
00:31:23,239 --> 00:31:27,280
a like sort of a brand name email provider who look quite,

762
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:30,959
-- you know, like
-- Gmail. All right, let's just say Gmail, right.

763
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:33,750
You know, if you're using Gmail or Outlook or something,

764
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,599
Outlook 365 or whatever it's called now,

765
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:39,750
you're probably no offense. But if a virus gets through to you then like,

766
00:31:40,689 --> 00:31:41,099
yeah,

767
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:41,709
it's,

768
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,199
they have a suspicion

769
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:48,000
that the cost of buying a new device and let's face it.

770
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:50,719
Like, like cell phones are getting really expensive again.

771
00:31:50,729 --> 00:31:54,189
They came down for a little while they're going back up. But anyway, my, my guess

772
00:31:54,459 --> 00:31:56,750
and I'll, I don't know if I can quantify this.

773
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,359
I'll have to do some research to see if I can but my guess

774
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,459
is the, the cost of buying a new device and migrating your life over to it,

775
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,459
which, that, that has a huge cost as well.

776
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,739
-- So
-- for Apple, it's basically a dollar a day. Right?

777
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,979
You're looking at a new $1000 cell phone every three years.

778
00:32:13,989 --> 00:32:17,290
And the cost of moving all your stuff over is almost zero because you just

779
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:19,540
assuming you use icloud, you log in, you're done

780
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,449
-- well.
-- ok. It may be in the Apple

781
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:26,430
system but, but here's the thing, if I keep using my old Apple device forever,

782
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,790
my guess

783
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:28,869
is

784
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:32,229
it is, it will cost me less than a dollar a day.

785
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:36,849
When, when, if I eventually get ped in some way versus buying a new one,

786
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:40,079
we're actually going to be for my kids for cell phone.

787
00:32:40,089 --> 00:32:43,430
They're going to be sharing an old iphone se in an order box.

788
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,599
What's in an Otter box?

789
00:32:45,949 --> 00:32:49,359
An auto, you know, it's one of those cases that's like IP 68 rated and like,

790
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:52,550
oh, the indestructible cases. Right.

791
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,150
Yeah, because like their kids and they're idiots.

792
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,599
Uh, love you guys though. But, um,

793
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,719
yeah, I mean, realistically because,

794
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:03,400
yeah, he's, the, the phone is gonna be locked down.

795
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:07,459
He'll be able to use it to make like phone calls and like, use messaging and that's it.

796
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:10,680
Right. And in that case, an old outdated phone is just fine.

797
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,339
Yeah.

798
00:33:11,829 --> 00:33:12,859
All right.

799
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,650
It's actually cheaper than buying him a new phone.

800
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,180
I imagine it is.

801
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,089
Alright. So I guess in summary consumers still doomed

802
00:33:20,469 --> 00:33:21,500
but it doesn't matter.

803
00:33:22,199 --> 00:33:22,520
Yeah.

804
00:33:23,109 --> 00:33:23,900
There we go.

805
00:33:24,449 --> 00:33:27,030
Yeah. No, I to put it bluntly, you know,

806
00:33:27,709 --> 00:33:30,239
I mean, unless you do something really crazy,

807
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,560
like send all your money to some Prince in Nigeria,

808
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,609
that's not the fault of your technology.

809
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:35,859
That's just normal.

810
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,859
Humans suck at everything. Behavior.

811
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:40,420
Like I'm just thinking like

812
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,410
the people I do know that have had to deal with this stuff. Yeah, it really does suck.

813
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:48,050
It's tens of hours of dealing with like identity theft and stuff. But

814
00:33:49,459 --> 00:33:50,699
I mean, it's, it's honestly,

815
00:33:50,709 --> 00:33:54,180
I'd rather deal with that than getting in a car accident and messing up my neck.

816
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,040
So anyway,

817
00:33:55,709 --> 00:33:56,130
there we have.

818
00:33:56,969 --> 00:33:59,390
