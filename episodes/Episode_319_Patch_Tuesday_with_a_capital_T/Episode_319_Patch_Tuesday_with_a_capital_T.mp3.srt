Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,479 --> 00:00:12,069
Kurt Siegfried and my partner in thinking about stuff that may or may not matter.

2
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:14,489
-- Josh Bresser's
-- does anything matter.

3
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:15,250
Lunch.

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,110
-- Lunch is important.
-- It's true.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,590
Lunch is coming up after I'm done talking to you for me.

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:20,930
But anyway,

7
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:25,100
so I, I have a, I have a funny personal anecdote to tell.

8
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:26,520
I am in

9
00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:28,770
a great deal of pain right now

10
00:00:29,149 --> 00:00:31,889
because it is a Wednesday

11
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:32,909
and

12
00:00:33,279 --> 00:00:35,849
the weather was very nice on Monday and Tuesday and I

13
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,180
took my actual real road bike out and overdid it.

14
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,939
And so now I really heard

15
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,380
you exercised.

16
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:43,740
Why did you exercise?

17
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,180
I ride like thousands of miles a year on my bike. I, I love riding my bike

18
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:53,509
and I ride a stationary bike in the basement in the winter because it's cold and

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,456
I'm not one of those people willing to ride outside and the ice and snow.

20
00:00:56,465 --> 00:00:56,925
But the,

21
00:00:56,936 --> 00:01:01,215
the problem I realized is it keeps me just in shape enough that I can overdo

22
00:01:01,226 --> 00:01:05,295
it when I get on the real bike and put myself in like excruciating pain.

23
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:06,335
So

24
00:01:06,435 --> 00:01:06,816
that's

25
00:01:06,996 --> 00:01:07,075
at

26
00:01:07,755 --> 00:01:11,456
least it was raining today and so I couldn't go ride outside this morning.

27
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:12,776
No, it's important to exercise.

28
00:01:12,905 --> 00:01:16,536
It is. I agree. I, I like riding a bicycle. It's

29
00:01:16,896 --> 00:01:17,375
a, a,

30
00:01:17,592 --> 00:01:18,692
it is something I enjoy.

31
00:01:18,702 --> 00:01:24,251
I listen to podcasts and I get to look at all the neat things as you ride past.

32
00:01:24,421 --> 00:01:27,692
I love riding bicycles, but I've been hit by a car

33
00:01:28,101 --> 00:01:31,921
-- and locally that's kind of a normal thing for cyclists.
-- That is a problem.

34
00:01:31,931 --> 00:01:37,452
Definitely. I, I put a lot of effort into staying off of roads whenever possible.

35
00:01:37,461 --> 00:01:39,652
So I've mostly been lucky I don't think,

36
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:46,339
-- have I been hit? No, I haven't been hit in a long time. I had some run ins
-- in a long time.

37
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:48,940
Wow. I mean, that makes it perfectly safe.

38
00:01:48,949 --> 00:01:52,529
Well, that's when you're, if you bike a lot you're gonna get, you're gonna get hit.

39
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,699
I mean, it's just how it goes.

40
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:57,580
It wasn't anything hard but I, I didn't need like, medical attention.

41
00:01:57,819 --> 00:01:59,699
-- Yeah.
-- Just a, just a little bump.

42
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:02,760
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But no, I mean, that, that's definitely a concern.

43
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:06,620
It, it's one of the issues I think with being a bicyclist in the city.

44
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,910
It's unfortunate. It annoys me but it is what it is

45
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:13,600
anyway. So,

46
00:02:14,179 --> 00:02:15,289
speaking of pain.

47
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,919
So, I, it's funny because I haven't, like, I run two windows machines locally. My

48
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,800
desktop and one of my sons has a windows desktop for gaming and

49
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,309
I

50
00:02:23,529 --> 00:02:25,929
don't really pay attention to Microsoft patch Tuesday anymore.

51
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,919
Other than, you know, I do update eventually

52
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,399
within a day or two.

53
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:33,229
And you had mentioned that this patch Tuesday was particularly bad.

54
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,270
You were not kidding. 117

55
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,259
vulnerabilities that they admit to.

56
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:43,369
And, and here's the thing I know for a fact, Microsoft will not give CV S

57
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:45,059
to issues they find internally,

58
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,660
like if they find a security issue internally and fix it internally,

59
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,940
they just, that's what they do. They don't bother attaching a CV to it.

60
00:02:51,179 --> 00:02:55,169
Well, it, it's a little more complicated than that. I, I talked to someone there.

61
00:02:55,264 --> 00:02:58,544
-- I, I disagree with this mind you, I'd like to preface it with this,
-- but, well,

62
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:00,975
-- this is what I was told by them a few years ago
-- and, and well,

63
00:03:00,985 --> 00:03:02,324
so here's the way they view this.

64
00:03:02,335 --> 00:03:05,445
It's not that they don't give them to internal things. It's

65
00:03:05,654 --> 00:03:08,714
imagine for example, this XML or not XML,

66
00:03:08,725 --> 00:03:12,664
this uh Windows R PC critical issue that's probably going to get wormed.

67
00:03:13,074 --> 00:03:16,904
That is just remote code execution. No, off, no, nothing. Right.

68
00:03:16,914 --> 00:03:19,684
If you can, if you can basically see a Windows machine

69
00:03:19,794 --> 00:03:20,914
that has the

70
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,820
R PC port, which is what, like 445 or something maybe open,

71
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,270
you can basically paw the machine.

72
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:26,679
OK.

73
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:29,149
-- No, that's CF si don't
-- know who cares.

74
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:29,570
II,

75
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:29,770
I

76
00:03:29,929 --> 00:03:31,429
doesn't matter.

77
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,919
Anyway, you, you can look that up. I tell the story.

78
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:37,710
The idea is so they find, let's say they find two R ce s,

79
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:40,940
they're only gonna claim it's one because in their opinion,

80
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,899
you already have to update it for one R ce, what's the difference if there's two?

81
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,419
So they'll like because they obviously rewrite huge portions of code

82
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,539
and they do a lot of things to,

83
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:53,740
it's not intentionally to hide these but it's harder to see.

84
00:03:54,089 --> 00:03:57,259
And so that's their view of it already has one critical.

85
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,539
Who cares if it's fixing five other criticals? One is enough.

86
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,139
I don't agree with it, but I understand their argument.

87
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:04,100
Yeah, I was gonna say,

88
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,740
I also don't necessarily agree with it because

89
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,100
I would like more technically correct data.

90
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:07,800
But at the same time,

91
00:04:08,029 --> 00:04:11,949
here's the, you know what, this reminds me of Cisa issuing in the last two weeks,

92
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,220
they've issued like what three or four bulletins about Google Chrome updates.

93
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:18,260
And my take on that is either you're running Google Chrome up to date

94
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,720
or you're not.

95
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,279
There's no in between. There's no like, oh, we're going to patch it in 30 days. No,

96
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,440
you, that update button shows up,

97
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,320
you hit that smash and like update button

98
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:31,350
and same thing with windows, especially like on the server.

99
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,390
I can be like you can maybe you can slow down a bit but on a desktop

100
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,679
you just,

101
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,500
you keep your fleet up to date or else you, you lose.

102
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:42,209
Well, so here's where I think it's more complicated than that.

103
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:47,290
I think it's easy to say that it's not always practical in many organizations.

104
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:51,410
But I think more importantly is we exist now in this space where there's all this

105
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,269
detection, software and technology.

106
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,980
And so, for example, you've got what you call indicators of compromise.

107
00:04:58,179 --> 00:05:02,250
And so if Microsoft says here's the bug we fix that's critical

108
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,609
in R PC,

109
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,220
people are going to figure out what it really means.

110
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,320
They're gonna understand how to exploit it and then they're

111
00:05:08,329 --> 00:05:11,679
going to look for that particular signature in network traffic.

112
00:05:11,859 --> 00:05:13,309
But if there's another thing

113
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:16,869
that is also exploitable, it has a different signature.

114
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:19,109
Are you going to even know that's there?

115
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:23,380
And are you going to miss that particular vulnerability if it gets exploited?

116
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,209
And that's my complaint over trying to

117
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,390
bunch these together and hide behind one thing

118
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,390
and, but like I said,

119
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,829
it really boils down to either you keep your stuff really up to date

120
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:33,369
or have a ton of other compensating

121
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,059
controls which you can't really realistically do

122
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,600
for a lot of these bugs,

123
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:38,880
not on a desktop.

124
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,250
I I know it's not quote

125
00:05:40,369 --> 00:05:43,959
unquote realistic or easy to keep these things up to date, but Attackers don't care.

126
00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:48,100
Uh And the second thing is this sort of leads to the kind of the cultural

127
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,320
ecosystem history of windows, which is

128
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:51,630
it

129
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:57,339
fundamentally came out from, well, the mindset came from D OS to Windows, you know,

130
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,359
to windows server.

131
00:05:58,369 --> 00:06:01,000
But fundamentally, it's, it's all about a single user system

132
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:02,989
with no real controls.

133
00:06:03,869 --> 00:06:06,920
And that culture shows in even something as simple as the

134
00:06:06,929 --> 00:06:09,829
way it handles file permissions and spaces and file directories.

135
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,510
You know, like if you,

136
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,250
if you load something from like program space files slash blah, blah, blah, blah,

137
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,000
blah, the first thing it tries is CF

138
00:06:17,179 --> 00:06:18,190
OOL and programs

139
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:21,649
with the rest of the stuff is like an argument basically,

140
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,559
you know, unless you properly escape the path and everything, it just,

141
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,859
it handles it really dumb.

142
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,010
And I mean, that's what we're seeing with. Git,

143
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:30,279
right, today

144
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,299
or yesterday, I think. Was it

145
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:33,079
whatever?

146
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,709
Oh, it says today.

147
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,200
So today the get project released new versions which drives a pair of security

148
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,920
loans and they're so stupid basically,

149
00:06:38,929 --> 00:06:43,130
if you can drop a dot Get config into like this into the root directory.

150
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,579
Well, get, well, it looks for it and

151
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,829
opens it up and does whatever it says in there.

152
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:52,709
Well, that affects all operating systems. That's not a Windows problem.

153
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,040
There's one problem that's Windows only and that involves uninstalling.

154
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:56,869
But,

155
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,670
but I was going to say that the big difference here though is Linux takes the tact of,

156
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:02,029
hey, that's my root file system.

157
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,790
Like if you pseudo you can touch it but otherwise don't know.

158
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:09,670
Right. And so it's, it's better protected by default. Whereas on Windows,

159
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,779
I can scribble all over the C directory by default.

160
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:13,540
Well, I mean,

161
00:07:13,549 --> 00:07:16,079
not necessarily like here's an example it is

162
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:18,160
potentially a problem on a multi user system.

163
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,880
And I have a perfect example is,

164
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,670
so let's say when I do stuff, I put like garbage in temp all the time, right?

165
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:25,690
Where I'll create like

166
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:26,209
maker

167
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:26,619
slash

168
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:27,989
temp slash A

169
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:32,179
and then I'll like, download a bunch of crap into a and unzip it and it just like,

170
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,489
I've got garbage all over and I don't have

171
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,450
to care because I know it'll get cleaned up later

172
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:37,700
automatically. Right

173
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,579
now. If I, like,

174
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,700
have a directory called A

175
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:47,320
and I run git in that directory, what git will do is get, looks for it,

176
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:51,140
basically just starts going backwards up the directory tree looking for a dot Git.

177
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:55,799
So if I run a get operation because it's just a habit, I do it, you know, I'll run, like,

178
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,399
get log or something all the time in weird places.

179
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:01,609
And it's always like, oh, this isn't a get repo, what are you doing? You idiot.

180
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,760
But if, if say an attacker creates a dot Get directory in slash temp,

181
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:08,070
which they could totally do.

182
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:12,359
And I'm in slash temp slash A and I run git,

183
00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:15,970
it's going to make its way into that dot Git that's attacker controlled.

184
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,980
And that's kind of the problem because in that dot Git you can make it run scripts,

185
00:08:19,989 --> 00:08:21,890
you can make it do all kinds of wacky things.

186
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,119
Yeah.

187
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:24,769
-- Right. Right.
-- Yeah.

188
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:27,779
But I mean, the difference being is that on a Linux machine or whatever,

189
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,640
more typically you'll have like, you know, tilda slash temp,

190
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:32,539
like you'll have your own personal temp directory.

191
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:33,859
I

192
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,840
hope is there, does that exist? I don't know, there's, there's things you can do.

193
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:40,239
-- I never,
-- it depends on the distro and I don't use

194
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:40,979
any of that crap.

195
00:08:40,989 --> 00:08:44,640
-- That's like part of
-- the challenge. Well, and there's polly instantiated temp.

196
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,109
Right.

197
00:08:45,489 --> 00:08:45,820
Anyways,

198
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:49,905
the point is Windows has this cultural legacy of being a single user system.

199
00:08:49,994 --> 00:08:54,325
And so, for example, for me to use my desktop in any meaningful useful way,

200
00:08:54,335 --> 00:08:59,255
I have to log in as an admin user because to update a software to, well,

201
00:08:59,265 --> 00:09:01,164
I have to within the software, I have to update it.

202
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:03,734
It's not like R PM runs in the background, updating stuff,

203
00:09:03,955 --> 00:09:04,424
you know,

204
00:09:04,664 --> 00:09:05,164
um on

205
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:05,724
a machine,

206
00:09:05,734 --> 00:09:08,534
I have to go to system updates and I have to go to the Microsoft Store

207
00:09:08,544 --> 00:09:13,044
to do updates and I have to within certain apps like Chrome does its own updates.

208
00:09:13,155 --> 00:09:14,414
And I was actually just looking at github

209
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,234
desktop

210
00:09:15,744 --> 00:09:16,224
and it

211
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,929
II, I actually don't know how to update this. I look under help.

212
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,140
I look under a bunch of stuff and there's no

213
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,469
check for updates thing that I'm seeing.

214
00:09:24,869 --> 00:09:24,900
It's

215
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:25,559
magic.

216
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,380
There's

217
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:27,909
I, I

218
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:28,700
mean,

219
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:29,390
I'm not,

220
00:09:29,609 --> 00:09:31,020
I'm not even clear on what version of github

221
00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:32,940
desktop I'm running anymore because there is no,

222
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,500
there's no show version or oh about github

223
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:39,099
desktop here. We go. I'm running 2.9 0.13.

224
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:41,619
Ah, there is a check for updates button hidden here. Ok.

225
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,859
-- So it's sort of hidden in the standard check version and hit
-- the updates

226
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:45,719
anyway.

227
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:47,299
The

228
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,619
point is to have a comment on that.

229
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,739
But on a Linux machine,

230
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:55,609
I very commonly just log in as a regular user, do my stuff until

231
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,950
I maybe need to install some new software package,

232
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,200
which is pretty rare because I basically

233
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,099
just slap everything in at the beginning and

234
00:10:01,789 --> 00:10:05,059
that's it. Right. Who cares? So it's, yeah, I don't know.

235
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,960
I feel like it's like two factor authentication. It has

236
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:10,799
real organizations have to be moving to hardware keys.

237
00:10:11,099 --> 00:10:14,140
No more of this software based authentication. No more of this S MS stuff.

238
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:16,739
It has to be like UB keys or Google Titan or whatever because

239
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:20,940
there's just too many failure modes with the other ones and it's 2022 and I'm sorry?

240
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:21,340
But

241
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,020
it's expensive and it's kind of a pain, but

242
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,340
that's just how it is.

243
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,460
I mean, I don't think that's a helpful attitude

244
00:10:29,739 --> 00:10:30,940
in any way

245
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,460
you're not wrong.

246
00:10:32,469 --> 00:10:33,260
It's like cars,

247
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,280
you can't buy a car without a seatbelt and airbags pretty much

248
00:10:36,289 --> 00:10:39,140
anymore because we decided that that is the bare minimum safety needed.

249
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:39,530
And I,

250
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:42,239
I literally have met people who complain about having

251
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,219
to spend money on that that they don't want.

252
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:45,070
And it's like

253
00:10:45,369 --> 00:10:46,460
now too bad.

254
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,260
There's an important distinction, I think

255
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,500
that you're missing. When you make a comment like that is,

256
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,520
cars don't come with seatbelts and airbags because

257
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,229
the auto manufacturers think it's a neat idea.

258
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,830
They come with seatbelts and airbags because a

259
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,830
regulatory body said you have to do this

260
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:05,690
except for

261
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:08,789
there are companies like Volvo, which one of their big stick is selling safety.

262
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:09,590
And

263
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,299
I think there are niches for that.

264
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,390
But I think fundamentally,

265
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,909
I mean, it doesn't, I think Schneier

266
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:17,989
has a whole piece.

267
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,270
He wrote about this, what the security market for lemons or something.

268
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,080
We might have even done a podcast on it like years and years ago.

269
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:23,859
But

270
00:11:24,429 --> 00:11:24,890
I think

271
00:11:25,025 --> 00:11:27,955
security is a, is a good example of that is,

272
00:11:28,224 --> 00:11:29,684
it's easy to say

273
00:11:29,885 --> 00:11:33,034
that we're doing more security and that's why

274
00:11:33,044 --> 00:11:35,474
it costs more and there's always going to be

275
00:11:35,645 --> 00:11:38,034
consumers that understand that and they're willing

276
00:11:38,044 --> 00:11:39,965
to pay a premium for more security.

277
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:43,010
But I think the vast majority of people don't care.

278
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:46,219
Pause. I'm not talking about consumers, I'm talking about businesses,

279
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:49,489
whatever businesses are just consumers. It's the same thing.

280
00:11:49,729 --> 00:11:50,409
And that's, there's

281
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:50,539
a,

282
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:51,690
there's a difference there.

283
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,969
I, I disagree.

284
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:53,690
I think,

285
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,390
I think there are loads of businesses that

286
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,270
if you said here's a computer that cost $4000

287
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,140
but it has

288
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:05,489
90% security and here's a computer that costs $3000 and it has 50% security.

289
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,380
They're going to be like three grand. It is.

290
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,500
I guarantee it

291
00:12:08,619 --> 00:12:11,570
most small and medium businesses. That's what they care about.

292
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,710
But basically what I'm saying is businesses have a

293
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:16,599
bit more responsibility than say a consumer does.

294
00:12:16,609 --> 00:12:18,359
Right. Well, they should,

295
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:19,919
I

296
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,349
don't think they always do though.

297
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,929
Well, they certainly don't behave like that. No.

298
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,190
I mean,

299
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,250
they'd be putting lead in the baby milk if they could make a

300
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,330
-- dollar doing it in some places
-- that's

301
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,070
literally happening in China where they're finding

302
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,400
baby formula and milk and things like that that have been laced

303
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:37,289
with awful things because some company made a little bit more money.

304
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:40,179
And I mean, this is what was happening in the United States

305
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,809
where there was, I watched a documentary, I forget the guy's name,

306
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,830
but it was like this

307
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:49,140
basically mad scientist person who ended up, he was like,

308
00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:54,280
he found volunteers to slowly poison to prove that like

309
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,070
all these additives and food were bad

310
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,750
and it's a completely banana story for sure.

311
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,599
But it's still even with all this evidence and even

312
00:13:03,609 --> 00:13:05,929
with all the research and everything that was going on,

313
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,429
it took decades to see real change.

314
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,989
But I think fundamentally places have to get better at this.

315
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,260
Otherwise you're going to have events, you know, where like some r

316
00:13:14,469 --> 00:13:14,570
some

317
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,520
worm comes through your infrastructure and,

318
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:18,309
and destroys your company potentially.

319
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,340
-- I
-- mean, maybe it, it's, I, I think about this one a lot.

320
00:13:21,349 --> 00:13:22,940
-- I mean,
-- so let's let me put it this way.

321
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,570
Can you you can't get a business lease without insurance.

322
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:28,929
Nobody will lease you a space unless you're insured because

323
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,330
it's just, that's a thing.

324
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:32,719
Right.

325
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,710
Right. Well, well, although why is it a thing?

326
00:13:35,719 --> 00:13:39,419
It's a thing because the owner of the property wants to understand that

327
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,340
their risk is lower if you have insurance. Right.

328
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:46,239
And I think that's what it comes down to

329
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,140
and when we think about things like cybersecurity,

330
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,750
I mean, let's frame it in the context of this, this ridiculous windows update.

331
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:51,919
Right.

332
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:56,739
There's going to be loads of people who don't install this particular patch

333
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,729
set because maybe they don't know or they're not paying attention or whatever.

334
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:04,460
There's a million reasons, right? And so who's going to say you have to do this thing?

335
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:05,840
Nobody.

336
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,099
And if they don't do it, maybe they have a bad thing happen.

337
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:10,979
Maybe they don't, who's to say?

338
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:13,789
I guess what I'm saying is I'm past the point of feeling sorry for them.

339
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,700
-- Oh,
-- I don't feel bad for them at all.

340
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:15,900
You know,

341
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:18,500
when these companies get hacked and it turns out they have terrible infosec.

342
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,020
It's like,

343
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,390
-- yeah, that's, that's literally what happens. I agree. I
-- agree.

344
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,169
If you get punked because you did a dumb thing that's on you.

345
00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:29,380
-- You made a mistake like that was just dumb.
-- Ok. This is wild because I'm seeing

346
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,539
sorry when I said 100 and 17

347
00:14:31,729 --> 00:14:38,049
1 site says 100 and 17 1 says 100 and 21 says more than 100 and 21 says 100 and 26.

348
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:40,700
And how come we can't get basic agreement on this fact?

349
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,809
That blows my mind.

350
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,179
-- Which fact is
-- this

351
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:46,500
-- on how many CV S are on Microsoft Tuesday this month?
-- I don't know.

352
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,489
-- I haven't, I didn't count,
-- I'm seeing different numbers all over the place.

353
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:52,739
-- It
-- could be. I mean, again, this is, these are hard topics,

354
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,380
whatever.

355
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,169
Um

356
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:54,929
I just,

357
00:14:55,349 --> 00:14:56,090
I don't know,

358
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:56,429
I,

359
00:14:57,359 --> 00:15:00,630
I feel like again, if you're using, if you're trying to use Windows as a,

360
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,760
as a true multi user system, you,

361
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,700
-- you can't safely do that. I'm sorry, it just doesn't work
-- that way.

362
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,859
No, nothing is multiuser anymore.

363
00:15:08,869 --> 00:15:14,419
I think it is clear that using anything multi user is just dumb.

364
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,690
We've had so many security problems that only affect

365
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:20,739
a system that has multiple users.

366
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:24,210
And now we have so much virtualization and containerization technology,

367
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,090
it's foolish to even try

368
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:30,650
to put more than one user on the same logical system or virtual.

369
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:32,409
-- I don't know what you call it, virtual system,
-- whatever.

370
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:35,559
And again, people, you know, that's an extra cost, that's extra hassle,

371
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,770
that's extra expertise.

372
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,429
And people just aren't going to do it because we've had stuff like that.

373
00:15:39,489 --> 00:15:43,090
-- Hell, even in the Windows world for decades,
-- maybe. I don't know.

374
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,890
Well, I, I've seen it deployed like it, it does exist,

375
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,549
I don't know anything about Windows. Like

376
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:53,150
you could you could just make up lies to me and be like, oh, ok. That sounds neat.

377
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,890
Like, literally no idea.

378
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:55,940
I,

379
00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:01,489
no, I, I don't know. I just because part of like, I, I've been seeing to segue

380
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:03,830
the topic of smart contract security audits has come up a

381
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,919
lot recently and I basically apply the knowledge I have from,

382
00:16:05,929 --> 00:16:07,840
you know, standard source code auditing, which is,

383
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,109
you know, given a billion dollars. Would you bet your life it's bug free.

384
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:12,950
Well, of course not. Right. You want to live

385
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,520
and even if your contract is bug free,

386
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:18,000
the system it's running on might have some flaw

387
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,469
that then can be exploited through the contract.

388
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:22,710
And so what I've been trying to tell people is

389
00:16:22,719 --> 00:16:26,000
that you have to plan and build for failure.

390
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,859
Right. So a perfect example of that is fire insurance.

391
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:32,200
I've done a variety of things to make my house fire safe.

392
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,390
You know, I've got to buy a whole bunch of smoke alarms.

393
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,059
I generally, you know, I do my campfires outside the house, not inside the house,

394
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:43,549
-- you know. So that's an important safety tip right there.
-- What is that a problem like?

395
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:45,690
Um, well,

396
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,710
uh uh uh quite a few derelict buildings locally have been burnt

397
00:16:48,719 --> 00:16:51,409
down by homeless people setting fires inside to stay warm in winter.

398
00:16:51,549 --> 00:16:52,179
I see.

399
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:53,669
So,

400
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:53,960
yeah,

401
00:16:53,969 --> 00:16:56,909
and I do have a fireplace which I actually did get a

402
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:59,849
chimney sweep out to clean and make sure it was correct.

403
00:16:59,859 --> 00:17:03,380
And he, you know, he, he put one line of beating of, uh,

404
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,030
to make it more air proof on the bottom.

405
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,630
Like, literally it was like

406
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:10,439
a minor thing, but, you know, carbon monoxide can come out of there.

407
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:13,089
And that's not a happy gas. It's a sad gas,

408
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,449
but I still have fire insurance

409
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,489
because despite everything I've done,

410
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,858
I'm still planning that there's that small possibility that my place burns down.

411
00:17:21,868 --> 00:17:22,079
And

412
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,108
the thing I realized from having my garage be hit by a neighbor's

413
00:17:25,118 --> 00:17:28,259
car is it's also not just about the money but it's ok.

414
00:17:28,269 --> 00:17:31,129
It's 3 a.m. on a Tuesday. Your house just burned down. Who do you call?

415
00:17:31,269 --> 00:17:32,639
Yeah. Well, I have no idea.

416
00:17:32,649 --> 00:17:33,109
But my,

417
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,629
my insurance adjuster knows a guy who knows a guy called Noah who

418
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,058
shows up with a load of lumber and fixes my garage in like,

419
00:17:39,068 --> 00:17:39,438
seven hours.

420
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,199
Right. Right. No. And, and that's, I mean, that's one of the reasons.

421
00:17:43,209 --> 00:17:46,439
-- Yeah, I think insurance is beneficial. I mean, well, for
-- them it's Tuesday.

422
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,560
Right. Well, yeah, they do this every day.

423
00:17:48,699 --> 00:17:51,680
For me it's a major life altering event and for them it's Tuesday.

424
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:56,520
I mean, so here is where I want to pull this back into the realm of, of security.

425
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,310
There was also something I saw on Twitter where obviously everyone's like, oh,

426
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,349
what are we going to name?

427
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:06,140
The new Microsoft worm that's inevitably going to come out for RDP and someone says,

428
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:10,739
oh, we should have a list of names just like the National Weather Service

429
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:11,959
hurricane

430
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:17,849
names. And another person says we can't even agree on what major events are.

431
00:18:17,859 --> 00:18:20,770
How are we possibly going to start naming them?

432
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:21,699
And it's like

433
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,819
none of these people are wrong in any way

434
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:28,619
because it is a very strange and difficult problem.

435
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,500
But now, I guess at the same time,

436
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:34,989
the National Weather Service has very specific metrics

437
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:39,949
that dictate what is a hurricane and what is not. And like, you can measure wind speed

438
00:18:40,339 --> 00:18:41,329
-- and
-- categories.

439
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,989
Right. Right. All that stuff

440
00:18:43,469 --> 00:18:44,829
in the world of security.

441
00:18:44,969 --> 00:18:46,010
What, what's an event?

442
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,079
I mean, one of my favorite examples is so there was log for Shell, right,

443
00:18:49,089 --> 00:18:51,630
which was like a big to do and it was,

444
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:54,709
none of us will forget it for a long time.

445
00:18:54,939 --> 00:18:56,670
Then a couple of weeks ago,

446
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,900
there's this thing called spring for Shell that comes up in the spring framework.

447
00:19:00,229 --> 00:19:02,550
And to be perfectly honest, Spring for Shell is a dud,

448
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:05,849
like there's a bunch of organizations trying to make a big deal about it,

449
00:19:05,859 --> 00:19:07,219
but the reality is like,

450
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,479
no one's really affected and I don't think I haven't heard of anyone being exploited

451
00:19:11,489 --> 00:19:15,569
by this because it's one of those like these 10 insane things have to be done

452
00:19:15,949 --> 00:19:18,589
in order for you to be vulnerable and no one has done that.

453
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:19,369
And like,

454
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,719
so it has a name,

455
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,069
it shouldn't,

456
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,510
but who, who decide, you know what I mean?

457
00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:28,469
I hate to do this. I'm going to read a slide. I just wrote yesterday.

458
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:29,869
-- Coordinations of vulnerabilities.
-- Oh,

459
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,170
-- yeah,
-- this is still terrible

460
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:32,760
in the open

461
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,140
source world. The distro and Linux

462
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:34,780
list

463
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:36,079
are still run by sor

464
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,310
from a single server,

465
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:37,900
right?

466
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,119
There's this one guy named solar designer who's been

467
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:42,140
like running this for 20 plus years because,

468
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,170
-- well, thank you. I don't.
-- Yeah, he's an awesome dude.

469
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:47,959
Uh Twitter hashtags were successful with hashtag log

470
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:48,109
for

471
00:19:48,219 --> 00:19:50,520
shell, but relying on spontaneous self-organization

472
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,140
isn't exactly reliable.

473
00:19:52,439 --> 00:19:55,540
Very certain organizations exist that can help with regional response.

474
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:59,339
And here's the kicker, this is a very hard problem due to lack of standards,

475
00:19:59,349 --> 00:20:01,800
infrastructure and so on eeg secure messaging.

476
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:04,439
Like I was looking into this the other day. So we've got things like Sam L and

477
00:20:04,699 --> 00:20:06,530
Oath for authentication between providers, right?

478
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,050
Like so I can use Google as my sso to access

479
00:20:09,739 --> 00:20:12,040
mail gun or Sendgrid or whatever. But

480
00:20:12,689 --> 00:20:15,459
let's say I want to send a piece of data from provider A to

481
00:20:15,469 --> 00:20:20,150
provider B that says like this document is classified as X severity X,

482
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,640
whatever.

483
00:20:20,689 --> 00:20:22,829
There's no way to do that. And so what we're finding is

484
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:27,359
within an ecosystem of like Amazon or Microsoft or Salesforce.

485
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:31,020
You can take your data classify it, restrict access to it and do a good job there.

486
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:34,824
But the minute it leaves that ecosystem, it kind of loses all that stuff

487
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:37,344
and there's no way to protect it, you know.

488
00:20:37,354 --> 00:20:40,084
So like this one company had red, yellow, green data,

489
00:20:40,094 --> 00:20:42,515
like really sensitive sort of sensitive public,

490
00:20:42,594 --> 00:20:45,694
kind of like once the red stuff leaves and Microsoft,

491
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:47,084
it's like the Microsoft ecosystem.

492
00:20:47,094 --> 00:20:49,584
It's like, you know, we put it on a Linux server to serve it out

493
00:20:49,685 --> 00:20:50,984
through the web securely

494
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,890
that the data that defines what we want to do with it can't go with it.

495
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,729
And I'm like, yeah, those standards don't exist. I'm sorry.

496
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,510
Um, and we're seeing this increasingly because it's so bizarre, but

497
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:03,829
most of these large companies don't want to be locked into a single vendor.

498
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:04,709
It's very strange.

499
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:05,400
-- Well,
-- yeah,

500
00:21:05,449 --> 00:21:05,520
that

501
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:09,089
might have happened before and it didn't work out real good.

502
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:12,430
Here's a real simple example. You find a massive vulnerability.

503
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,150
How do you communicate with all these different organizations?

504
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:15,834
And I don't mean, like,

505
00:21:16,165 --> 00:21:20,395
process wise, I mean, like, do you use email? Do you use text messages? Signal?

506
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:21,165
Telegram, whatsapp?

507
00:21:21,685 --> 00:21:23,775
I mean, we historically used Twitter and like

508
00:21:23,885 --> 00:21:26,505
you and I know how to do this because we've done it a lot.

509
00:21:26,645 --> 00:21:31,704
But I think, imagine a, someone who, who a new researcher

510
00:21:31,844 --> 00:21:35,104
who doesn't have a rolodex full of contacts,

511
00:21:35,385 --> 00:21:36,505
what would they even do?

512
00:21:36,614 --> 00:21:37,385
And I was about to say that

513
00:21:37,854 --> 00:21:39,905
when you say use email, do you mean, like, I just

514
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:45,300
randomly pick a list of people to email or is there like a mailing list? I can use,

515
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:48,250
we know who to email.

516
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:49,339
That's what I'm

517
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:49,550
saying

518
00:21:49,729 --> 00:21:49,989
is

519
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:51,390
this is,

520
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:54,099
this is why like, solar design is so hard to replace because

521
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:57,660
even though he has like a public list of who's on the thing, it's still like,

522
00:21:57,989 --> 00:22:00,300
do I, it's like maintaining the host file? Right?

523
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,930
Like, do I maintain my own host file with who I trust?

524
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,339
No, God, no, I want to outsource that to somebody.

525
00:22:05,589 --> 00:22:06,099
And it's just,

526
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,969
it's ridiculous that we, we don't even have like I'm gonna say it,

527
00:22:09,979 --> 00:22:12,400
we don't have a good secure messaging standard and I'm sorry.

528
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,859
But if somebody says P GP or GP G, no, that lost.

529
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:15,219
I,

530
00:22:15,229 --> 00:22:17,719
I stopped doing it one day with like I used to

531
00:22:17,729 --> 00:22:21,040
religiously sign all my email and then one day I stopped

532
00:22:21,489 --> 00:22:26,900
and nobody noticed or cared to tell me and asked why did you stop signing your email?

533
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:28,699
Right.

534
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,650
I was a third of the traffic to that, you know,

535
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,380
uh oh, it's a sec list and

536
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:35,020
nobody cared to notice. So

537
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:41,060
it's, we're, we're lacking just even basic stuff of like if I want like,

538
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:44,550
how do I physically get a message over to Bob?

539
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,349
I

540
00:22:45,609 --> 00:22:47,869
-- email?
-- I've got to reframe this discussion.

541
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:50,369
I don't think it matters. I think

542
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,410
the problem I see is you're complaining about secure messaging,

543
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,359
secure messaging isn't the problem because we just

544
00:22:57,369 --> 00:23:01,170
don't even have like the vernacular and capability of

545
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,170
bringing the right people together and having an

546
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:06,964
honest and real discussion messaging is step 12.

547
00:23:06,974 --> 00:23:08,645
We don't even have step one.

548
00:23:08,864 --> 00:23:09,175
-- Well,
-- I,

549
00:23:09,185 --> 00:23:10,964
sorry, that's kind of what's implied here is it's,

550
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:14,694
it's a very concrete example of like you, we can't even do that

551
00:23:14,795 --> 00:23:18,234
quote unquote, simple thing of sending a message to the right person.

552
00:23:18,244 --> 00:23:20,135
Yeah, let alone who is the right person

553
00:23:20,614 --> 00:23:22,484
-- or
-- what are you going to tell them?

554
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:24,579
And how are you going to coordinate it?

555
00:23:24,589 --> 00:23:25,119
And I mean,

556
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:30,000
this is why Google Project Zero has taken like the hard stance they have of

557
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:34,150
90 days because this is what happens is you send a message to someone like,

558
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,599
oh, well, we have to tell these people and then these people and they're like,

559
00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:37,479
you have 90 days

560
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:38,770
figure it out.

561
00:23:39,449 --> 00:23:40,030
You know what I mean?

562
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,260
Because if you don't, otherwise it turns into, you know, two years later,

563
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,849
we're still trying to figure out who to email about this.

564
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,939
And that's essentially my argument about you

565
00:23:47,949 --> 00:23:49,930
got to install your patches quickly or else

566
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:53,250
that's, it's the same argument, right? You just, yeah, it sucks.

567
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,550
And it's tough and it's, but you just got to do this.

568
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,849
It's like I have to do laundry otherwise I'll smell weird.

569
00:23:58,209 --> 00:23:58,609
I mean,

570
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,569
yeah,

571
00:24:01,229 --> 00:24:01,719
but

572
00:24:02,069 --> 00:24:05,060
like, I want to take advantage of all this technology safely.

573
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:08,510
Here's the biggest thing is for me, I just want it to be reliable and honestly

574
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:12,339
keeping up to date is generally more reliable than not keeping up to date,

575
00:24:13,439 --> 00:24:15,250
ignoring security issues. Even

576
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,939
that's easier said than done.

577
00:24:17,949 --> 00:24:23,140
You don't work for a company that's heavily regulated. You don't work for a company

578
00:24:23,349 --> 00:24:25,810
that if your server crashes, someone dies,

579
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,739
you don't work for a company

580
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,630
that you have literally thousands of other businesses depending on.

581
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,680
And if you install an update and the system crashes, no one gets paid this week like

582
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,589
that is, it's not as simple as saying update or else nerd.

583
00:24:39,689 --> 00:24:41,869
I mean, I think there's a lot of nuance in this.

584
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,819
The problem is at some point you're going to have to

585
00:24:43,829 --> 00:24:46,469
do emergency updates because there is a worm stomping around,

586
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:48,430
-- you know, and you need to patch for
-- it.

587
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:52,459
Not necessarily like this is what compensating controls are for

588
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:56,444
-- if they exist. But
-- I think so, here's, here's my complaint.

589
00:24:56,535 --> 00:25:00,525
I think there are always people on each side of this argument.

590
00:25:00,535 --> 00:25:03,494
Some are gonna say update now or else some are going to say

591
00:25:03,505 --> 00:25:06,344
I can't update because my systems go down and they crash and stuff.

592
00:25:06,354 --> 00:25:06,944
But I think

593
00:25:07,074 --> 00:25:09,224
like all problems, there's something in the middle

594
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:10,145
where

595
00:25:10,255 --> 00:25:13,055
yes, you definitely want to install these updates.

596
00:25:13,064 --> 00:25:16,025
But obviously, depending upon what your situation is,

597
00:25:16,035 --> 00:25:17,214
you might not be able to do that.

598
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,224
So if you can't,

599
00:25:18,395 --> 00:25:21,425
here are the other things you should be doing in the meantime,

600
00:25:21,435 --> 00:25:23,185
not as a long term solution,

601
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,339
but just to get you by until you can install these updates. And I think

602
00:25:27,489 --> 00:25:29,160
taking either stance

603
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:32,339
is absurd and I think we end up in

604
00:25:32,349 --> 00:25:35,319
situations where people on each side of these discussions

605
00:25:35,329 --> 00:25:37,449
just end up talking over the top of each

606
00:25:37,459 --> 00:25:39,489
other because they don't want to hear anything.

607
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:43,859
And then you have just the schmuck stuck in the middle who are trying to do their job.

608
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:47,319
And it's really hard though because the noisy people are on each side.

609
00:25:47,489 --> 00:25:49,800
Yeah. I, I, what you just said help.

610
00:25:50,135 --> 00:25:51,074
I think part of it is

611
00:25:51,275 --> 00:25:53,875
I would prefer to see people do patching rather

612
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:57,324
than compensating controls who wouldn't get their patching down

613
00:25:57,334 --> 00:26:01,005
and get that under control before doing compensating controls

614
00:26:01,015 --> 00:26:03,354
and trying to do magic stuff around that.

615
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:06,305
Of course, no one would disagree with that statement.

616
00:26:06,535 --> 00:26:07,665
But it's also

617
00:26:07,844 --> 00:26:09,064
not practical.

618
00:26:09,395 --> 00:26:14,545
This is like saying Kurt, that the solution to poverty is don't be poor.

619
00:26:14,555 --> 00:26:16,545
Like, no, it's not.

620
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:19,119
That's not the solution at all.

621
00:26:19,219 --> 00:26:19,400
Well,

622
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,739
but I think part of the challenge is statistically the people who

623
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,839
aren't patching are also not generally doing a ton of compensating controls.

624
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:26,270
They're just neglecting their it.

625
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,920
And that's another problem

626
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:33,280
that is well outside of our ability to discuss or,

627
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:39,800
and, I mean, this is even true of fire safety. Right. There are

628
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,829
good of the people that have piles of oily rags in the corner

629
00:26:44,089 --> 00:26:45,910
and like, don't do that.

630
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:49,719
There's a building a few blocks away from here that just burned down, right?

631
00:26:49,729 --> 00:26:52,540
Uh, 43 or four story apartment thing.

632
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:56,270
And apparently it turns out most of the people there did not have renters insurance.

633
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:02,209
I feel like I heard this story on the radio or something.

634
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:02,829
Well, no,

635
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:05,869
it's a low income area and so a lot of these people don't have fire insurance.

636
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:08,290
I doubt that they can really afford it. You know, with the rise

637
00:27:08,489 --> 00:27:11,859
with, with the way the cost of living has been rising here, especially in Canada and

638
00:27:11,979 --> 00:27:14,170
I feel bad for them. But at the same time, it's like

639
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,739
we can't, I, I don't know that we as a society can, like,

640
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,250
cover all those insurance costs.

641
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:22,339
You know, because I also worry then that people might have more reckless behavior.

642
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,040
Right. That moral hazard aspect. Right.

643
00:27:24,069 --> 00:27:26,619
And I don't know what the answer is because I don't want to see the people suffer.

644
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:30,819
But at the same time it's like, but can we as a society afford to make them whole, like,

645
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:31,500
in the long term?

646
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,500
You know, if, if everybody gets free fire insurance,

647
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,020
are people going to be less fire safety?

648
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:35,479
I don't know.

649
00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:38,189
-- I doubt it because people generally don't like burning their stuff down.
-- But

650
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:38,310
I,

651
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:41,819
I don't think, you know, the case at all. And

652
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,390
no,

653
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,780
but I think your,

654
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:50,229
what you hit upon is a social topic I do not wish to discuss because it is,

655
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:53,699
it's complicated and difficult we'll say.

656
00:27:54,189 --> 00:27:54,750
But

657
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,579
anyway,

658
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,560
it even varies significantly within a city.

659
00:27:59,569 --> 00:28:01,560
Let alone with, between different countries.

660
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:04,839
But this is even true of it. Security.

661
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:05,500
Right.

662
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,550
Where you can look at

663
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,680
what it, security looks like across

664
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:13,689
a billion organizations and

665
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:18,109
it, it's the same problems you can, you can map them into

666
00:28:18,209 --> 00:28:20,040
societal issues of,

667
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:23,339
you have the gamut of, can't afford to do this thing.

668
00:28:23,349 --> 00:28:27,390
They know they should do to, don't care because they're incompetent to.

669
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,750
I'm doing everything correct and I'm spending loads of money on this and

670
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,390
it's going to save me tons of headache someday because of it.

671
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:35,420
You know,

672
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:40,099
it's all the same problems. And I think in summary,

673
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,300
humans are squishy bags of meat who do dumb stuff.

674
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,140
And that's exactly why I'm,

675
00:28:46,719 --> 00:28:48,729
that is actually my biggest argument for getting the

676
00:28:48,739 --> 00:28:50,989
hardware two factor authentication keys out is like I

677
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,229
keep going over all the failure scenarios of everything

678
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:55,430
else and it's like we remove the meat bags

679
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,130
whenever

680
00:28:56,239 --> 00:28:58,140
possible. Yes. I mean, that's,

681
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,949
I think if you look at the,

682
00:29:00,209 --> 00:29:03,829
the vast majority of successful, almost anything in the world

683
00:29:03,939 --> 00:29:07,349
when you can take out human mistakes, things get better.

684
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:10,229
I mean, this is true of like automation in general. Right.

685
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:12,959
Where less humans, less problems.

686
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:15,400
Well, passive safety measures like airbags.

687
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,890
Right. Right. Exactly.

688
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,500
Anti lock brakes, airbags, you know, crumple zones,

689
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:21,869
the ton of things, uh,

690
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,410
that are probably very subtle in your car that we don't even think about that.

691
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:29,420
Some engineers like, yeah, we spent 17,000 hours on that, you know,

692
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:33,030
to reduce something by 0.07 of a percent of risk.

693
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:33,739
But

694
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,729
-- by the
-- way, oh, perfect example,

695
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:38,829
uh, when you're doing wiring, you know how the wire goes into a metal box.

696
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:38,900
Well,

697
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,430
you have to have something around that to protect

698
00:29:40,439 --> 00:29:42,560
it so it doesn't chafe and then short out,

699
00:29:42,569 --> 00:29:43,319
you know, things like that.

700
00:29:43,329 --> 00:29:43,619
Right.

701
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:48,050
Because I was redoing some wiring and I found one or two things that were done wrong.

702
00:29:49,959 --> 00:29:51,979
Well, everything I've done wrong

703
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,329
anyway. Anyway, II, I agree. I agree. I think

704
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:59,890
anyway, in summary, update your systems, everybody.

705
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:00,910
Yeah,

706
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:03,910
and maybe go for a bike ride but don't push it too hard.

707
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:07,800
Yeah, that's true. I'm really, I'm hurt and I stand up when I recorded like,

708
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:10,719
I'm feeling it, man. I'm gonna have to go lay down after this. I think

709
00:30:12,719 --> 00:30:15,650
I, I really, my back really hurts like I'm not gonna lie to you.

710
00:30:15,829 --> 00:30:20,459
So let's, let's end it so I can end my excruciating torment. Thank you, Kurt.
