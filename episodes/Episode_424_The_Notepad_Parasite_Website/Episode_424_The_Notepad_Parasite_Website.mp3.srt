Hello and welcome to the real open source podcast.

1
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,859
Not that fake one you got from somewhere else

2
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,340
-- with myself. Kurt. You just
-- said the real open source podcast.

3
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:17,299
It's the real open source security podcast. Kurt.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,670
-- Well, and that proves it's the real one.
-- This is not the real open source podcast.

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,750
I don't even know if there is an open source podcast

6
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:24,670
probably.

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:24,959
Anyways,

8
00:00:24,969 --> 00:00:26,639
that proves that this is the real open

9
00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:29,069
source security podcast because we make mistakes.

10
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:34,659
-- We, I I remove all of my mistakes and edit.
-- This is true.

11
00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:38,340
But yeah, so like, so Notepad Plus Plus recently

12
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,180
announced essentially that somebody grabbed,

13
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:43,599
uh what was it? Notepad dot Plus.

14
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:47,889
So plus is a new top level domain because there's like 2000 top level domains now

15
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:51,259
and is essentially, I don't even know what word to use.

16
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,810
They're, they're not squatting it because they own the domain legitimately.

17
00:00:55,959 --> 00:01:00,080
The content that they've posted is a copy of the real Notepad Plus Plus.

18
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:00,950
And they're like, ok,

19
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:05,250
so they have a like disclaimer thing at the bottom and I'm just going to read it

20
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:08,949
and it's, it's titled Disclaimer. And if you go to the website, which

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,750
I didn't even notice the disclaimer. Where is it?

22
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,680
How do I know it's a disclaimer because it says it's

23
00:01:13,919 --> 00:01:13,930
a,

24
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:14,680
no,

25
00:01:14,919 --> 00:01:16,519
no, I'm saying I didn't even notice it.

26
00:01:16,529 --> 00:01:18,379
I just scrolled all the way to the bottom and now I see.

27
00:01:18,389 --> 00:01:19,599
Ok,

28
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,419
this is funny because when I go to a website I almost always scroll

29
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,059
to the very bottom to see whatever legal crap they've included at the bottom.

30
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:29,550
Which is where like infinite scrolling websites really drive

31
00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:31,339
me nuts because I can't get there anyway.

32
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:36,000
Here's what the disclaimer says. Notepad Plus Plus is a trademark of Don Ho.

33
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,510
Notepad dot Plus is not affiliated, sponsored or endorsed,

34
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:41,750
endorsed by Don Ho in any ways.

35
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,319
This is an unofficial fan website created

36
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:48,150
for general information slash educational purposes only.

37
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,089
Yeah, that old chestnut from pirate,

38
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,309
any context. Found

39
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:56,510
this website is our personal opinions and do not purport to

41
00:02:00,949 --> 00:02:05,489
-- All other trademarks are the property of their respective owners.
-- Yeah, that's

42
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:06,230
a,

43
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,210
there's at least three errors there

44
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:10,000
and two.

45
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:13,850
Yeah, you can't just disclaim your way out of like, trademark infringement, right?

46
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:15,809
Like there's fair use stuff.

47
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:17,960
I'm pretty sure this is not a fair use.

48
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:18,080
Like,

49
00:02:18,089 --> 00:02:20,000
it's like those youtube React videos where they just

50
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:22,410
play the video and sit quietly while they watch it

51
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:26,649
versus like cinema sins where they tear the thing apart for like an hour.

52
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,080
Let's back this up a little bit because

53
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,009
the reason this came up is Kurt sent a link

54
00:02:33,162 --> 00:02:33,972
to,

55
00:02:34,162 --> 00:02:37,121
I don't, not technically, to me it's just a response on Mastodon that,

56
00:02:37,132 --> 00:02:38,141
that you tagged me in.

57
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:40,531
Yeah, I added you in it to take you in. So you'd see it.

58
00:02:40,701 --> 00:02:42,171
Yeah. So we, we talk about it.

59
00:02:42,182 --> 00:02:46,361
But anyway, the notepad plus plus and we should say notepad plus plus is a,

60
00:02:46,371 --> 00:02:47,742
like text editing.

61
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,341
It's a good piece of software.

62
00:02:49,522 --> 00:02:52,011
Yeah, it's a text editor on Windows. Right?

63
00:02:52,322 --> 00:02:55,792
Well, and it's been around forever. It's to put it bluntly, it's like

64
00:02:55,912 --> 00:02:57,132
what emacs is to Linux

65
00:02:57,253 --> 00:03:01,233
-- Notepad plus plus is to Windows except
-- Notepad plus plus users probably won't

66
00:03:01,244 --> 00:03:05,074
like hound you and follow you around until you run their editor.

67
00:03:05,134 --> 00:03:09,154
Well, and, and you can just take control us to save and control like all the,

68
00:03:09,164 --> 00:03:10,744
all the normal key bindings work.

69
00:03:10,753 --> 00:03:15,824
Ok. So the Notepad Plus plus website puts down, puts up a post thing.

70
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,684
I don't know what to call it that just says help us

71
00:03:18,093 --> 00:03:18,414
announcement.

72
00:03:18,904 --> 00:03:19,574
That sounds good.

73
00:03:19,764 --> 00:03:21,233
And it says help us to take down

74
00:03:21,345 --> 00:03:22,966
the parasite website,

75
00:03:23,085 --> 00:03:26,705
-- which has a very parasite website just has a ring to it that
-- well.

76
00:03:26,716 --> 00:03:28,345
It reminds me of the Mo the Korean movie

77
00:03:28,356 --> 00:03:30,266
Parasite where they live in the rich people's basement,

78
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:33,175
which is kind of actually exactly what's happening here.

79
00:03:33,186 --> 00:03:33,766
I

80
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:37,406
have never seen that. It probably doesn't have a spaceship or a lizard.

81
00:03:37,546 --> 00:03:37,966
So

82
00:03:38,156 --> 00:03:39,595
-- No,
-- but it won a lot of awards

83
00:03:39,606 --> 00:03:40,166
anyway.

84
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:44,876
And basically this, this the Notepad Plus Plus people go on to explain

85
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:45,326
that

86
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:47,848
there's a website called Notepad dot Plus.

87
00:03:48,037 --> 00:03:48,617
That

88
00:03:49,027 --> 00:03:52,817
is clearly pretending to be the official Notepad Plus plus website.

89
00:03:53,147 --> 00:03:57,507
And if you type into Google download Notepad Plus plus,

90
00:03:57,697 --> 00:03:59,688
the fake site is the second hit.

91
00:04:00,188 --> 00:04:03,697
And they're asking people to go to the

92
00:04:03,707 --> 00:04:07,417
Google Report malicious software website and report this site

93
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:08,707
-- that as
-- harmful.

94
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,559
First off, I actually did some spot checks.

95
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:18,040
I downloaded a bunch of the like it, it is, it is basically bit for bit identical,

96
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:21,920
both the web content like the download pages and the content that you download.

97
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:23,640
Ok. So

98
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,040
it's not technically malicious

99
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:29,630
because they're just serving copies of the files and, and in my too, I put,

100
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,880
it's not malicious dot dot dot yet.

101
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,119
I mean, you could say yet,

102
00:04:34,489 --> 00:04:35,440
I think

103
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,460
I will, I did not say you

104
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:41,710
not malicious I disagree with because this is a website

105
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:43,851
clearly trying to trick people,

106
00:04:44,001 --> 00:04:46,790
right? But I'm saying specifically by the letter of the law,

107
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,730
it's not a malware. It's not a bad download. It is a good copy of the file currently

108
00:04:51,871 --> 00:04:53,651
and sort of like member sourceforge.

109
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,001
We all used to love sourceforge and trust.

110
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:00,121
Source Forge and sourceforge was awesome. And then one day sourceforge

111
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,071
did a thing

112
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,430
and you remember what it was?

113
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:03,342
I mean,

114
00:05:03,351 --> 00:05:05,022
which thing are you talking about when they

115
00:05:05,032 --> 00:05:07,502
tried to backdoor all the downloads with their,

116
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:08,861
their adware.

117
00:05:08,872 --> 00:05:09,881
No, they didn't try.

118
00:05:09,891 --> 00:05:13,582
They did, they put, they put that adware stuff in all the downloads and then

119
00:05:13,932 --> 00:05:16,861
we all sort of realized, oh, maybe Sourceforge isn't, you know,

120
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:18,272
where we want to host our stuff and

121
00:05:18,712 --> 00:05:19,622
everybody moved to github.

122
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:20,951
But the point is like,

123
00:05:21,022 --> 00:05:24,941
Sourceforge had a ton of goodwill and community endorsement and, and

124
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:25,861
trust

125
00:05:26,582 --> 00:05:27,062
and,

126
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:30,453
and then they blew it away And now this website is starting

127
00:05:30,502 --> 00:05:34,803
from a position of already sort of stealing that trust literally by

128
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:37,252
copying the website and everything and like,

129
00:05:37,602 --> 00:05:39,252
seo magic winning,

130
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:41,352
like they're basically stealing the goodwill and the

131
00:05:41,363 --> 00:05:43,412
trust from the real notepad Plus plus,

132
00:05:43,622 --> 00:05:45,463
like they're not building it themselves.

133
00:05:45,622 --> 00:05:47,722
Right. Right. Right. And that's

134
00:05:47,912 --> 00:05:48,683
wrong.

135
00:05:48,942 --> 00:05:52,692
-- And look, there's, and there's a couple of pieces to this
-- wrong.

136
00:05:52,703 --> 00:05:55,203
How it's, well, it's illegal. It's a trade

137
00:05:55,553 --> 00:05:56,933
violation, unquestionably

138
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:00,743
assuming the OPEC plus plus is trademark. I actually didn't check.

139
00:06:00,813 --> 00:06:02,164
I don't, you know, that's a good question.

140
00:06:02,174 --> 00:06:05,014
It talks about the trademark and their, their crappy disclaimer,

141
00:06:05,023 --> 00:06:06,713
but I didn't actually look it up.

142
00:06:06,723 --> 00:06:08,204
But let's pretend it is.

143
00:06:08,424 --> 00:06:10,033
Well, no, let's not pretend, let's look it up.

144
00:06:10,044 --> 00:06:12,604
-- Well, ok,
-- you look it up and I want to kind of explain

145
00:06:12,903 --> 00:06:13,433
there, there,

146
00:06:13,444 --> 00:06:16,764
there's like the open source world and we'll say the traditional world,

147
00:06:16,773 --> 00:06:18,394
I'm going to put them in two separate buckets,

148
00:06:18,403 --> 00:06:21,144
which I think the open source world is the world now.

149
00:06:21,153 --> 00:06:21,604
But whatever.

150
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:26,035
Historically speaking, if you were an organization doing a thing,

151
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,945
you would get a trademark literally for this purpose

152
00:06:28,964 --> 00:06:30,774
where if someone tried to pretend they were,

153
00:06:30,785 --> 00:06:35,515
you, you could take them to court and you could get them to change something.

154
00:06:35,804 --> 00:06:36,904
Right now.

155
00:06:36,924 --> 00:06:41,915
I understand that going down the path of trademark enforcement is not cheap

156
00:06:42,105 --> 00:06:44,035
because you have to hire lawyers and you have to send

157
00:06:44,045 --> 00:06:46,385
letters and you have to do all this crazy work.

158
00:06:46,404 --> 00:06:47,714
-- I
-- get that. It's like

159
00:06:48,085 --> 00:06:51,786
-- hundreds of thousands of dollars,
-- minimum, tens of thousands, for sure.

160
00:06:52,096 --> 00:06:52,765
Right. Right.

161
00:06:52,776 --> 00:06:52,985
So,

162
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:58,735
it's one of those sort of protection activities that is not designed to support a,

163
00:06:58,746 --> 00:07:02,665
-- like, random hobbyist doing something for free
-- and not to be a jerk.

164
00:07:02,675 --> 00:07:05,596
But I can't find anything about a notepad Plus Plus trademark

165
00:07:05,696 --> 00:07:07,765
and that could be, and they may not have trademarked it.

166
00:07:07,816 --> 00:07:10,045
I can't find anything on their website. Yeah.

167
00:07:10,075 --> 00:07:12,515
No, I, I cannot, I mean, I could, of course,

168
00:07:12,526 --> 00:07:16,256
be wrong but I am trying to find the word trademark, like,

169
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:19,326
doesn't seem to occur on notepad Plus plus website.

170
00:07:19,427 --> 00:07:21,856
Like, and it's, I'm not finding it and they might not have.

171
00:07:21,867 --> 00:07:25,557
So that, and that's kind of a big problem here because all of a sudden

172
00:07:25,766 --> 00:07:29,546
the lay, like, basically Notepad plus plus is saying we have two legs, sort of,

173
00:07:29,557 --> 00:07:31,576
we have one leg to stand on, which is, this is malware.

174
00:07:31,587 --> 00:07:33,356
Well, it's not, it's a bit for bit copy.

175
00:07:33,437 --> 00:07:36,937
And there's a second potential leg which is trademark infringement, which

176
00:07:37,066 --> 00:07:40,747
if you don't have a trademark, you, you can't claim trademark infringement.

177
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,329
It is correct. I don't see anything in the

178
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,609
United States patent and trademark office search.

179
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,899
I'm not looking real hard but

180
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,130
well and getting a trademark, like it's not super expensive, but it is also

181
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:56,970
-- not many open source projects do
-- it. It's

182
00:07:57,149 --> 00:08:00,250
hard to get a trademark correctly and you often have to

183
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:05,119
show that you're an actual like organization using the trademark.

184
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:06,709
It's not like

185
00:08:06,809 --> 00:08:08,309
I can't trademark. Kurt

186
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,420
sucks. Right? Unless I create a, an organization.

187
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:14,880
-- Well, a line of Kurt sucks. T-shirts,
-- right?

188
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,399
-- Something
-- like

189
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,359
-- that,
-- which are now available in the store.

190
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:19,100
That's right.

191
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,410
No cafe press just on demand, right?

192
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,220
-- Uh Is cafe press still a thing even, I don't know, I'm
-- old.

193
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,820
I for all I know it's gone the way of source forge.

194
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:28,559
I

195
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,600
don't even know where you'd get like a, a cafe Paris still exists.

196
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:34,119
I don't know, whatever it doesn't matter. Ok.

197
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:36,000
So if it's not trademarked,

198
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,200
then there's definitely not

199
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,919
the like trademark angle to this.

200
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,719
-- I don't think there's anything,
-- it,

201
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:45,640
it may not be illegal and that could be why they're asking people to

202
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,400
report the site to Google because they don't have any other avenues here.

203
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,539
Well, and my one thought was, what about copyright?

204
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:53,969
Like copyright by default is, you know,

205
00:08:54,017 --> 00:08:56,596
I can't just take a copy of somebody's website and host it.

206
00:08:56,846 --> 00:08:59,536
And I should know because remember 20 plus years ago I wrote

207
00:08:59,546 --> 00:09:02,637
the Linux Administrative Security guide and if you google it in quotes,

208
00:09:02,856 --> 00:09:05,697
there are dozens and dozens of websites still

209
00:09:05,706 --> 00:09:08,017
hosting it or PDF versions of it claiming,

210
00:09:08,026 --> 00:09:10,067
you know, essentially that like here it is.

211
00:09:10,336 --> 00:09:11,327
Oh, wait, wait, wait,

212
00:09:11,466 --> 00:09:17,096
when I click. Download from the notepad dot plus site takes me to Notepad

213
00:09:17,387 --> 00:09:19,327
Plus plus.org, it takes me

214
00:09:19,494 --> 00:09:21,153
the actual download site.

215
00:09:21,273 --> 00:09:22,434
-- So
-- for now,

216
00:09:22,443 --> 00:09:23,783
that's why it's the same

217
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:24,653
because

218
00:09:24,883 --> 00:09:26,004
it is the same.

219
00:09:26,854 --> 00:09:28,414
But like you and I both know that the web

220
00:09:28,424 --> 00:09:31,013
server could randomly serve malware one in 1000 times.

221
00:09:31,044 --> 00:09:34,504
It could. Exactly. And, and I would not trust this

222
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,064
-- at all
-- for sure. And so it's,

223
00:09:37,223 --> 00:09:41,193
I, I suspect it is what it looks like, which is the person found good content.

224
00:09:41,203 --> 00:09:42,383
Like people used to find my Linux

225
00:09:42,773 --> 00:09:44,843
a security guy because it was like hot for

226
00:09:44,971 --> 00:09:48,810
CEO for Linux security because there was no other, there wasn't anything else.

227
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,070
And so he made a copy of the website.

228
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,681
And yeah, he doesn't even want to host the,

229
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,551
the files because they're too big and too much hassle to host.

230
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,801
They, they might be. And so he just literally

231
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,551
is, is he has advertising or p I assume it's a, he, we'll just say he for now,

232
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:05,241
statistically it's probably me

233
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:05,940
jerks.

234
00:10:06,341 --> 00:10:10,301
He's just, he has, you know, ads on the site that people see and

235
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:14,909
like this. What gets me is this is both ethically and morally wrong

236
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,880
and economically inefficient.

237
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,750
Like the amount of the amount of money they're probably making from,

238
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,820
this is not significant.

239
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,640
I imagine it's terrible for sure.

240
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,280
Like,

241
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:29,909
basically we're going to spend more time talking about this monetarily than he,

242
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,390
the person will probably make in a month.

243
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:34,979
Ok. Look, I think there's a piece to this

244
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:38,869
that I don't want to dwell on. But I think is important is

245
00:10:39,609 --> 00:10:43,309
this happened during the last election in the United States.

246
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,260
It's probably happening here. It happens all over the place where

247
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:50,549
there are people who live in parts of the world where for example,

248
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:52,489
a dollar to you and me isn't very much money,

249
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,789
but a dollar to them can be quite a lot of money.

250
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:57,780
And so a couple of dollars a day from a website for

251
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,229
people in the western world in North America,

252
00:11:00,349 --> 00:11:01,809
you're not going to blink at that.

253
00:11:01,849 --> 00:11:03,789
But there are places a couple dollars a day from

254
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:06,239
a website like this is going to feed the family,

255
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:07,219
right?

256
00:11:07,325 --> 00:11:10,375
So I think it's easy to say, oh, why are they doing this?

257
00:11:10,385 --> 00:11:13,854
It's not worth the time and the money, but for some people, it literally is.

258
00:11:13,864 --> 00:11:15,424
So, I, I didn't mean it so much that way.

259
00:11:15,434 --> 00:11:18,544
It's just, it's more that I'm, I'm like, morally and ethically this is wrong, but

260
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:23,304
-- worse economically it's inefficient. It's gross. It's, it is
-- very inefficient.

261
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:23,734
But

262
00:11:23,905 --> 00:11:27,354
but I'm saying there are economically inefficient to

263
00:11:27,364 --> 00:11:30,145
us isn't necessarily economically inefficient to other people.

264
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:30,664
Now,

265
00:11:31,155 --> 00:11:34,885
I, I want to wind this back just a little bit because

266
00:11:35,619 --> 00:11:40,929
I just got back from, besides Milwaukee in Cipher con like literally

267
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:44,239
Friday night. We, there's now a Sunday we're talking.

268
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,080
So I'm, I'm like,

269
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:49,489
still super tired and I will say anyone there who said hi to me who listens.

270
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,650
You're awesome. Thank you for listening. We had, I had a whole bunch of people.

271
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:54,159
It was really cool. I love that.

272
00:11:54,169 --> 00:11:56,849
So if you, if you ever, if anyone listening, ever sees me around it,

273
00:11:56,955 --> 00:11:59,724
a show or something, like come and say hi, I absolutely love it. It's so much fun.

274
00:11:59,734 --> 00:12:00,414
But anyway,

275
00:12:00,424 --> 00:12:04,385
so I talked about at uh cipher Con the size of

276
00:12:04,395 --> 00:12:06,614
open source and how big it is and it was a very

277
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:10,715
unusual talk because there's like at the end of like, I have literally no, no advice.

278
00:12:10,724 --> 00:12:12,265
There's no actions, there's nothing,

279
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:15,655
I just want you to know everything's giant and it not looking real good.

280
00:12:15,664 --> 00:12:18,335
-- I,
-- I'm working on a paper with a similar conclusion of like,

281
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:22,380
so now that you've seen from the mountain top, what it looks like, um,

282
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:26,859
-- good luck. Can't unsee it hopefully.
-- Well, you can ignore it.

283
00:12:26,869 --> 00:12:30,380
-- People ignore stuff all the time.
-- We'll, we'll ignore it.

284
00:12:30,489 --> 00:12:34,890
But anyway, one of the things that happened was during the talk, I was like, look,

285
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,000
it feels like the universe is crushing us all to

286
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,150
death because the universe is crushing us all to death.

287
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,359
Like it's literally happening.

288
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:44,169
If you look at tech everywhere, you've got like the XZ,

289
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,659
you've got this notepad plus plus thing,

290
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:50,739
you've got the gigantic size of open sources like log for J there's so much going on.

291
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,650
There are still people hosting

292
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:58,080
25 year old copies of a PDF file. Of course, there are like if you search for Linux

293
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,460
Administrative security guide, you don't even find me

294
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,440
until I was about to say the second page of search results.

295
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,049
But apparently Google went to infinite scroll now and funnily enough,

296
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:09,780
you mentioned going to the bottom of the page to look

297
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,020
for the Legalese and stuff.

298
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,739
Yeah, you can't do that in infinite scroll.

299
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,200
-- Well,
-- I'm, I'm like trying, but I'm not get like

300
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,280
-- there's
-- more,

301
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:20,690
I know you can glimpse it and then it fills it in and it like infuriates me to no end.

302
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,700
-- Oh,
-- interestingly, they, they pause and they,

303
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,590
they have give you a more results after about

304
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:26,849
the equivalent of about four screen fulls of results.

305
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:30,359
So they actually kind of pause at a point that's to protect them so

306
00:13:30,369 --> 00:13:34,099
that you can't automatically just keep scrolling down with like a web widget thing.

307
00:13:34,109 --> 00:13:35,380
You actually have to have a clicker

308
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,200
because

309
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:38,929
the one thing I've always been annoyed, Google doesn't have an API

310
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,520
and I would like to use an API.

311
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:43,349
-- So
-- I've, I've had, they don't want an API, they have to sell you ads.

312
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,739
-- They don't care.
-- Yeah, I know.

313
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:49,150
And so that's there again, this whole more results thing is, is not for your benefit,

314
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:49,940
it's for theirs.

315
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,530
Ok. Ok. Anyway, anyway,

316
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,309
the, the point of all this, right.

317
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,419
Where, like, I, I talk about the crushing weight, lots of people were like, yes,

318
00:13:56,429 --> 00:13:57,809
I feel there's crushing weight also.

319
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,750
Right. Like, things, something is weird. We don't know what's going on.

320
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,280
-- I think it's because we're noticing it finally.
-- No.

321
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:06,380
Sort of, well, we're noticing it because I think it's happening more often.

322
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,349
I think

323
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,510
historically speaking,

324
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:10,219
when

325
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:14,859
there were weird shenanigans, it often didn't affect very much people and, like,

326
00:14:14,869 --> 00:14:17,950
people stealing your, your, you know, Linux security guide,

327
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,950
they're paying you with exposure.

328
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,750
So it's fine.

329
00:14:21,099 --> 00:14:22,580
Actually a lot of them removed my name,

330
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,650
which I actually prefer because then people didn't complain

331
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:26,039
to me about it being out of date.

332
00:14:27,369 --> 00:14:27,590
So

333
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:27,989
that,

334
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,859
-- that's
-- even
-- worse.

335
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,429
But anyway, and, and look, this happens like on youtube and all over the place,

336
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:33,570
right?

337
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,669
Where people take the work of one

338
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,260
and they, they functionally just are, are, well, what is it called?

339
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:43,169
Um, the Hello Internet guys, uh, uh, free, booting, free booing.

340
00:14:43,179 --> 00:14:43,950
That's what they named it free.

341
00:14:44,409 --> 00:14:44,429
Yeah.

342
00:14:44,619 --> 00:14:44,739
Yeah,

343
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,659
there was, this was, uh,

344
00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:49,700
what C GP Gray and Brady Heron used to do a podcast called Hello Internet.

345
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:53,309
And it was really cool. It was, it was non topical and I loved it

346
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:53,809
anyway.

347
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,809
If we look at everything going on right now, it just,

348
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:02,150
it feels so big and so different than it ever has before.

349
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:05,739
I also can I add one thing? I just, I was thinking and I realized

350
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:09,169
it used to be companies strip mind open source,

351
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:11,770
but they didn't really interact with open source.

352
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,700
Like they didn't complain, they didn't make demands,

353
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,010
they just sort of took open source and ran with it.

354
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,690
Sure. Now we're increasingly seeing like with log for Jay, people say

355
00:15:19,969 --> 00:15:21,679
security questionnaires saying like,

356
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:23,210
like fill out the security questionnaire.

357
00:15:23,219 --> 00:15:25,789
What are you doing about log for J to some random open source project?

358
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,820
We're seeing the FFM peg thing where like a

359
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,489
Microsoft DEV files the ticket saying like,

360
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,739
basically this broke our team's product.

361
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,320
Like it's been a week, we need you to fix it.

362
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,510
And actually what it was is they changed a default setting

363
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,359
and you had to just change the command line thing.

364
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,520
-- Oh,
-- I haven't seen that. That's really funny.

365
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:46,039
Basically, the Microsoft DEV was like, saying this is a high priority bug for us

366
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,640
and I'm from Microsoft and you know, base I think they kind of expected.

367
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:52,859
Oh, you're from Microsoft? Yeah, like, oh, you must be important and it's like

368
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,679
the open source doesn't care. Well, some of them do.

369
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,229
That's like the classic. Do you know who I am?

370
00:15:57,239 --> 00:16:00,640
And the answer is like, no, I don't, I, I, like, I don't,

371
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:01,820
nor do I care.

372
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:05,640
Well, I've had people try to argue from authority with me.

373
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:08,989
I'm just like, I, I don't know who you are. Like, don't care either.

374
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,940
So, it was funny you say that because while I was at cipher con that happened,

375
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,409
someone was like, don't, you know who this is?

376
00:16:14,419 --> 00:16:17,390
I was like, no, I don't. They're like, oh,

377
00:16:17,539 --> 00:16:21,190
well, you should talk to them. I'm like, ok, but I still, who is this?

378
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,169
-- Like, yeah,
-- there's,

379
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:25,630
there's actually a lot of people on the planet as it turns out and I don't know,

380
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,609
Tom from Toronto.

381
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:27,820
I hope he's doing ok though.

382
00:16:28,346 --> 00:16:29,366
Right. Exactly.

383
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:33,106
You know, and it was, it's amusing and honestly, even if I knew who they were,

384
00:16:33,116 --> 00:16:35,046
I might pull that off just because I think

385
00:16:35,265 --> 00:16:37,065
anyone who pulls it, do you know who I am?

386
00:16:37,075 --> 00:16:38,645
Like, you need someone to, like,

387
00:16:38,656 --> 00:16:42,245
-- kick your ego in the crotch
-- unless you're like the US president,

388
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:42,846
like, trick

389
00:16:42,966 --> 00:16:46,466
-- question name, the German president.
-- I literally don't know who it is anymore.

390
00:16:46,476 --> 00:16:48,825
Does Germany have a president? Don't they have a prime minister?

391
00:16:48,835 --> 00:16:52,596
-- No,
-- they have a chancellor who holds power and the president is essentially ahead.

392
00:16:52,606 --> 00:16:55,822
Anyway, the point is the president is a figurehead position in Germany.

393
00:16:56,151 --> 00:16:58,841
It doesn't matter. So, like, you don't need to know who they are.

394
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,711
That's like knowing, you know what I mean? Like

395
00:17:00,901 --> 00:17:05,141
-- who's the, the, the second house whip
-- the president of Canada

396
00:17:05,421 --> 00:17:07,082
that just hurt me on the inside.

397
00:17:07,311 --> 00:17:09,371
Does Canada have a president and prime minister?

398
00:17:10,082 --> 00:17:10,482
So

399
00:17:10,871 --> 00:17:12,102
we have a prime minister.

400
00:17:12,112 --> 00:17:14,171
So the political party that wins the election

401
00:17:14,192 --> 00:17:16,202
is essentially invited to form a government,

402
00:17:16,491 --> 00:17:17,991
right? Either if they win a mature

403
00:17:18,608 --> 00:17:19,396
or whatever,

404
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:22,406
essentially the way it works in Canada is you go to the lieutenant governor,

405
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,557
who's the queen's representative in Canada, who,

406
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:26,916
who is our provisional head of state king?

407
00:17:26,926 --> 00:17:29,238
The king's sorry? Damn, I keep forgetting.

408
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:33,128
Well, I didn't vote for them like, you know, anyway, so, um yeah,

409
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:35,958
you go to the lieutenant governor who is the king's sorry.

410
00:17:35,968 --> 00:17:37,958
Thank you. The king's representative in Canada

411
00:17:38,248 --> 00:17:39,208
and essentially

412
00:17:39,378 --> 00:17:42,958
the, the lieutenant governor uh says you can form a government

413
00:17:43,073 --> 00:17:46,053
and they can say no and they have in the past, oh, how exciting.

414
00:17:46,193 --> 00:17:49,854
Like they can straight up say like I, I don't like the results of this election. Like

415
00:17:49,984 --> 00:17:50,923
do it again.

416
00:17:51,193 --> 00:17:51,884
Wow,

417
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:56,374
we're a constitutional monarchy. We're not a democracy, we're not a republic

418
00:17:57,173 --> 00:17:57,543
anyway.

419
00:17:57,803 --> 00:17:58,124
We're off

420
00:17:58,264 --> 00:17:58,284
the

421
00:17:58,614 --> 00:17:58,884
anyways.

422
00:17:58,894 --> 00:17:59,053
This,

423
00:17:59,063 --> 00:18:02,183
this speaks to this somewhat is that open source has been away for

424
00:18:02,193 --> 00:18:04,734
a long time and people were freeloading and that's kind of OK.

425
00:18:04,744 --> 00:18:07,963
But now a lot of them are becoming like the classic choosy beggar

426
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,439
and people are like, I can get offended by that. Like if you steal the lasg

427
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:16,469
uh whatever, OK? But if you like, start demanding that I fix it

428
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:20,229
-- like no go away.
-- I think, I know why this is happening.

429
00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:23,119
And this is related to all of the research I've been doing for

430
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:26,310
like the last six months on this talk I did at Cipher Con where

431
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:28,160
I have, um, I'll put a link to the,

432
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,640
the slides in the show notes because it has all the graphs and I love those,

433
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:34,040
-- those graphs are like,
-- they're, they're all insane.

434
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:37,199
-- They're
-- so
-- stupid. Even if they were logarithmic, they'd still be stupid.

435
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:37,939
-- They
-- are loga

436
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,599
well. Oh right. No, that's right.

437
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:40,199
They're, they're,

438
00:18:40,209 --> 00:18:43,589
I showed them all linear because it's all just exponential growth.

439
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:46,479
And here's the thing like the the amount of open source that exists

440
00:18:46,489 --> 00:18:50,560
today is like literally double what it was a couple of years ago,

441
00:18:51,209 --> 00:18:51,880
right? And it's,

442
00:18:52,003 --> 00:18:53,103
we're talking like

443
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:56,902
I think the number of packages and I took the ecosystems data,

444
00:18:57,012 --> 00:19:00,753
the number of packages and ecosystems is like almost 9 million.

445
00:19:00,762 --> 00:19:02,662
It's like 8.6 million or something like that.

446
00:19:02,672 --> 00:19:03,973
And then once you add inversions,

447
00:19:03,983 --> 00:19:07,383
you end up with like 96 million or something like that packages, right?

448
00:19:07,993 --> 00:19:11,762
And the the the users of open source are growing in a similar way.

449
00:19:11,772 --> 00:19:13,233
Every, every number,

450
00:19:13,243 --> 00:19:16,833
every graph you make of open source of anything of just software,

451
00:19:16,843 --> 00:19:18,566
even just like humanity, everything.

452
00:19:18,696 --> 00:19:22,526
-- It's all exponential growth which is
-- totally sustainable by the way, totally

453
00:19:22,865 --> 00:19:24,566
exponential growth. Never fails,

454
00:19:24,786 --> 00:19:25,515
never fails.

455
00:19:25,526 --> 00:19:27,235
Especially in the housing market because houses

456
00:19:27,245 --> 00:19:29,686
are this is no financial investment advice.

457
00:19:29,696 --> 00:19:31,836
-- What's that?
-- What's that island in Alaska?

458
00:19:31,845 --> 00:19:35,036
That was like full of exponentially growing reindeer.

459
00:19:35,046 --> 00:19:37,385
And then in six months they were all gone.

460
00:19:37,475 --> 00:19:40,625
-- That's everywhere with predators and prey.
-- Like, well, they had no predators.

461
00:19:40,635 --> 00:19:42,715
So they just kept multiplying and then,

462
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,619
then there were none left for some reason.

463
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,170
But anyway, everything is growing like crazy.

464
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:52,040
And let's say 1% of open source users are like complainers

465
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,099
where they they come and they demand what's going on.

466
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:59,949
Now. If you have 10 users, 1% is going to statistically be zero, right?

467
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,670
But if you have 10 million users,

468
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:10,390
1% is a lot of people, right? If you have 100 million users, 1% is

469
00:20:10,504 --> 00:20:12,673
a million people literally.

470
00:20:12,683 --> 00:20:17,313
And I think that's what we we are hitting like the insane growth phase

471
00:20:17,323 --> 00:20:19,413
of exponential growth with like open source

472
00:20:19,423 --> 00:20:20,984
and the internet and software and everything.

473
00:20:20,994 --> 00:20:26,024
-- And I think the reason it feels crushing is because it is crushing us
-- well,

474
00:20:26,034 --> 00:20:28,553
and I think it's also an element of eternal September is hitting.

475
00:20:28,563 --> 00:20:30,404
It's been September for

476
00:20:31,203 --> 00:20:33,553
it's eternal September in the sense of the companies

477
00:20:33,563 --> 00:20:35,943
now are making demands because what's the downside?

478
00:20:35,963 --> 00:20:37,833
I, I think they, they were before

479
00:20:37,968 --> 00:20:38,317
though.

480
00:20:38,547 --> 00:20:41,758
It's just, there's so many more they were making demands before.

481
00:20:41,767 --> 00:20:43,187
This is not new at all.

482
00:20:43,197 --> 00:20:46,008
I remember when we were at Red Hat, this was like the,

483
00:20:46,017 --> 00:20:49,118
the mid 20 tens give or take and you

484
00:20:49,128 --> 00:20:51,637
would see open source projects where people would say,

485
00:20:51,647 --> 00:20:54,468
oh, hey, you know, why aren't you fixing my bug?

486
00:20:54,478 --> 00:20:55,797
I can't do my job

487
00:20:56,277 --> 00:20:58,008
and the developers would be like,

488
00:20:58,128 --> 00:20:58,838
and

489
00:20:59,098 --> 00:20:59,498
you know what?

490
00:20:59,508 --> 00:20:59,868
And there's a,

491
00:20:59,878 --> 00:21:02,277
but I think there's a subtle second piece of that now that you mention it,

492
00:21:02,498 --> 00:21:05,277
it's not just that people are demanding that we add a feature for them,

493
00:21:05,381 --> 00:21:06,281
fix the bug. It's

494
00:21:06,982 --> 00:21:08,761
I am using your open source to make money.

495
00:21:08,771 --> 00:21:12,082
I want you to support me for free and fix this thing so I can make more money.

496
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:15,521
And that is inherently a bit offensive to many people, right?

497
00:21:15,531 --> 00:21:18,552
Because if I come to you and say, hey, I need youtube downloader,

498
00:21:18,572 --> 00:21:22,442
you need to fix the ID thing because my like my son who has autism really,

499
00:21:22,452 --> 00:21:24,881
I need to be able to download his youtube video so I can put them, you know,

500
00:21:24,891 --> 00:21:26,641
on pluck so that they don't go missing.

501
00:21:27,062 --> 00:21:29,001
I don't think many people are going to be offended by that.

502
00:21:29,011 --> 00:21:30,371
But if I say, hey, I use youtube

503
00:21:30,501 --> 00:21:32,722
Charlo to make a lot of money and I'm not giving you any

504
00:21:32,855 --> 00:21:33,605
it by the way.

505
00:21:33,706 --> 00:21:35,436
And I really want you to add this feature,

506
00:21:35,446 --> 00:21:37,485
fix this thing for me so I can continue to make money.

507
00:21:38,036 --> 00:21:38,446
Sure.

508
00:21:38,676 --> 00:21:39,286
Yeah.

509
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:42,845
Statistically, I suspect a lot of people would be kind of offended by that demand,

510
00:21:43,186 --> 00:21:46,475
right? I mean, OK, I have another good example, right?

511
00:21:46,485 --> 00:21:48,406
I've got I just pulled up the email.

512
00:21:48,546 --> 00:21:52,166
So I think I mentioned this a long time ago where I found a bug

513
00:21:52,546 --> 00:21:53,125
in

514
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,206
the way,

515
00:21:54,406 --> 00:21:56,125
the whatever the, the

516
00:21:56,245 --> 00:21:58,706
gnome for window drawing

517
00:21:59,005 --> 00:22:00,125
is right?

518
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:04,010
And I found a bug in it. When you're using X 11, it works fine in Wayland.

519
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:07,880
And at the time I couldn't use Wayland because

520
00:22:08,089 --> 00:22:12,369
what the, the Audacity audio editor wouldn't work correctly in Whalen,

521
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,969
but it worked fine in X

522
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,109
and I don't use Audacity anymore. So I switched to Whalen.

523
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:18,689
I don't care anymore like this buck and II, I get the mails.

524
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:19,890
But in anyway,

525
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,489
I reported this. It's been more than a year now, right?

526
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,810
And, and well, I shouldn't say I didn't report it.

527
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:28,150
I figured it out and someone else reported it,

528
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,491
but they didn't give the developers any useful information.

529
00:22:30,501 --> 00:22:33,312
-- The developers are like there's nothing we can do
-- realistically.

530
00:22:33,322 --> 00:22:36,381
Like most people that run into a bug or like I ran into a bug. It's broken.

531
00:22:37,182 --> 00:22:40,232
I spent like literally three hours

532
00:22:40,771 --> 00:22:42,391
starting with fresh

533
00:22:42,682 --> 00:22:45,432
-- gnome.
-- Normal people don't do that

534
00:22:45,602 --> 00:22:46,131
for sure.

535
00:22:46,141 --> 00:22:46,751
But I was like,

536
00:22:46,761 --> 00:22:49,572
I need to figure this out partially because it's a fun challenge and partially

537
00:22:49,582 --> 00:22:52,751
because like this bug is driving me nuts and I want to fix it again

538
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:55,901
for most people. This is not a fun challenge

539
00:22:56,303 --> 00:22:58,744
and I have no doubt I would have submitted a patch.

540
00:22:58,754 --> 00:23:02,014
Had I not switched audio editors at some point. But anyway.

541
00:23:02,254 --> 00:23:06,443
So like someone just replied to the issue that's basically like,

542
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:06,774
you know,

543
00:23:06,784 --> 00:23:12,524
this issue is still happening on 45.51 full major and five bug fix releases later,

544
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:15,984
it continues to be super annoying and blah, blah and they go on and on and I'm like,

545
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:21,213
do you think the developers are going to respond in a positive way to this comment?

546
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:24,796
-- Like, what do you think is going to happen?
-- What if you don't fix it?

547
00:23:24,806 --> 00:23:26,776
I'm taking my business elsewhere,

548
00:23:26,926 --> 00:23:29,206
-- right?
-- Like, seriously, like great.

549
00:23:29,215 --> 00:23:30,036
First of all,

550
00:23:30,046 --> 00:23:32,715
that doesn't even work at stores because either the

551
00:23:32,725 --> 00:23:34,365
person working at the store is like a,

552
00:23:34,536 --> 00:23:37,265
I'm going to use the word peon. I don't like that word but I don't have a better word.

553
00:23:37,276 --> 00:23:39,556
They're just a worker there and they don't care

554
00:23:39,765 --> 00:23:42,296
or like my favorite comic bookstore,

555
00:23:42,635 --> 00:23:46,036
they have one employee and the owners are a married couple.

556
00:23:46,086 --> 00:23:50,156
So reading the negative reviews on Google is so much fun

557
00:23:50,306 --> 00:23:51,196
because they just,

558
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,239
yeah, no, like they're like, yeah,

559
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,140
we spoke with our employee and it turns out you were a

560
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,719
jerk to them and so on and so forth or you know,

561
00:23:57,729 --> 00:23:59,599
like, yes, I remember that interaction.

562
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:01,839
You were a jerk, blah, blah, blah. You know what I mean? Like

563
00:24:01,939 --> 00:24:03,920
they and they straight up in their reviews are like,

564
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,310
it's cool if you don't like our store,

565
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,810
like there's different stores for different people and

566
00:24:06,819 --> 00:24:08,040
clearly our store is not for you.

567
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:10,900
And it's, it's a very nice way of saying, you know, some rude words.

568
00:24:11,489 --> 00:24:12,760
Like, it's like, bless your heart.

569
00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:13,599
Basically.

570
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,989
-- It's a Canadian version of bless your heart
-- anyway.

571
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:19,229
But, and, and I think that is comparable to what we're kind of seeing in the open

572
00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:22,130
source universe, right? Where, like, comic books are a great one.

573
00:24:22,609 --> 00:24:25,839
I would guess that in what the nineties, remember when there were like,

574
00:24:25,849 --> 00:24:27,979
barely any comic book stores and it was really hard to

575
00:24:27,989 --> 00:24:30,040
find comic books and it was like a huge deal.

576
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:32,859
And now you got the internet and comic book stores are everywhere.

577
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,199
I was never really into comic books. But yeah, I know what you

578
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:35,390
mean.

579
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,229
And now locally we were kind of,

580
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:39,489
we have that growth and now we're back down to only half

581
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:41,859
having about a dozen comic book stores.

582
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:44,380
Well, but the thing is like, there's the library and there's like,

583
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,939
comic books have really, yeah, they've kind of died out.

584
00:24:47,109 --> 00:24:49,760
-- Like, it's a, it's a niche thing
-- that could be, I don't know, I,

585
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,520
I haven't paid attention in years but I,

586
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,560
I remember there were a lot of comic book stores for a while.

587
00:24:53,569 --> 00:24:56,180
There's a lot of board game stores. Now, I see a lot of board game stores, for example.

588
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:56,579
Right.

589
00:24:56,859 --> 00:24:58,880
There's all kinds of stuff and this is normal, right?

590
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,319
Where you're always going to have growth and then waning of like,

591
00:25:01,329 --> 00:25:03,000
every industry you can imagine.

592
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:06,339
-- With the exception of open source.
-- Well, that's the thing I wonder about that.

593
00:25:06,349 --> 00:25:10,640
-- Like, is it ever going to go down?
-- No, because everything has software in it now.

594
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:11,479
Like it does.

595
00:25:11,569 --> 00:25:13,849
Like, here's the thing by definition,

596
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:17,354
if we build something with software that uses software, we need it,

597
00:25:17,364 --> 00:25:19,604
we're using it and one of two things is going to happen,

598
00:25:19,614 --> 00:25:20,954
we're going to continue to use it

599
00:25:21,094 --> 00:25:23,484
or it's going to be replaced with something even better that

600
00:25:23,494 --> 00:25:26,375
has probably more software and my evidence of that would be,

601
00:25:26,415 --> 00:25:29,244
remember all the stuff, like, look at my washer dryer behind me.

602
00:25:29,255 --> 00:25:32,265
Right. I'm waving my thumb at it, which no one can see except me.

603
00:25:32,275 --> 00:25:33,814
They have simple software

604
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:37,489
because they're like 10 or 15 years old, I'm guessing.

605
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,479
I don't know, they were here when I moved into the house and they work.

606
00:25:39,489 --> 00:25:42,650
-- So
-- I paid extra for stupid washers and dryers.

607
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,119
So that's the thing. Well,

608
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:45,709
if I were to buy a,

609
00:25:45,869 --> 00:25:48,369
like a normal modern washer and dryer,

610
00:25:48,469 --> 00:25:52,089
it would like, want an internet connection and it would have a whole s swack

611
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:53,689
-- more software, I
-- mean,

612
00:25:54,114 --> 00:25:57,515
-- software and that's the thing.
-- So I don't think it will ever go down.

613
00:25:57,645 --> 00:25:59,474
Just like logistics will never wane.

614
00:25:59,484 --> 00:26:03,435
Like logistics is a thing now and it's just more and more crazy and efficient.

615
00:26:03,444 --> 00:26:06,724
I want to bring us all the way back now

616
00:26:06,824 --> 00:26:09,084
to the actual topic of open

617
00:26:09,255 --> 00:26:13,114
source security, which is kind of where we started here way back when

618
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:15,155
I, I feel like

619
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:17,459
everything we look at,

620
00:26:17,589 --> 00:26:20,489
we can see massive insane growth. Right.

621
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,349
Even, even,

622
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:23,250
like I know we've complained about CV E I DS

623
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,800
and then they're not growing as fast as they should,

624
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,160
but they're still growing

625
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,449
and we're gonna have, we're gonna, in,

626
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:31,439
probably in 2025 we'll have double the CD ES we

627
00:26:31,449 --> 00:26:33,579
had in 2023 at the rate we're growing right now.

628
00:26:33,589 --> 00:26:36,040
Right. With, especially with the Linux kernel

629
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:39,890
and their malicious compliance of, of vulnerability filing.

630
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,209
Well, it's not, it's not malicious.

631
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,170
It's true.

632
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:42,560
I,

633
00:26:42,699 --> 00:26:43,239
I believe

634
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,750
it's the common vulnerabilities enumeration database.

635
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,680
And so don't we want to enumerate at all?

636
00:26:49,689 --> 00:26:52,239
Like, I'm, I'm hand waving and blinking here, right?

637
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:55,439
Like, you know, I do this with a I vulnerabilities and people are like, but you like,

638
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:56,900
and I'm like, I have stuff in there that's garbage,

639
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,239
but we have to collect everything.

640
00:26:58,469 --> 00:27:00,869
So that first of all, we can see what's good and what's bad.

641
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,349
We can see patterns and to do that, we have to have everything

642
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:04,000
ideal

643
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:06,079
and also conveniently enough,

644
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:09,079
we have way better data analysis tools now that we did even

645
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,150
two years ago, let alone 20 years ago.

646
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,900
Right. Well, and we need it because

647
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:16,229
there's billions of things now,

648
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,949
which anyway, anyway, here's,

649
00:27:18,959 --> 00:27:21,910
I think what we need to kind of maybe sort of discuss to

650
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,670
close this one out and this is vaguely related to like Notepad plus plus

651
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:26,709
and

652
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,229
there's just, there's so much going on, there's so much money around

653
00:27:31,479 --> 00:27:35,560
-- and there's, it's, it's easier than ever to host the website. For
-- example,

654
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:38,560
I can't say money, I would say value because there's also non

655
00:27:38,739 --> 00:27:42,420
monetary values. And I think, and Notepad plus plus is a great example of that.

656
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:46,260
There's the value of the goodwill of Notepad plus plus where like it's,

657
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:49,660
it used to be one of my standard things I installed on windows like

658
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:52,890
on day one of a windows reinstall uh for a lot of people.

659
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,300
It is

660
00:27:53,469 --> 00:27:54,010
you, you

661
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:57,119
it's on the top 10 list of things you install on windows to

662
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:00,849
make it usable because Notepad dot exe was not usable like it was because

663
00:28:01,339 --> 00:28:02,579
I think they're fixing it,

664
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,030
but it's getting better though. I will give it that.

665
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:05,569
But

666
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,969
so the point is there's value to be captured there and this person found a very

667
00:28:10,469 --> 00:28:15,510
inefficient but effective way to capture that value, just like people copying

668
00:28:15,689 --> 00:28:18,160
the Linux administrative security guide and putting ads on it,

669
00:28:18,339 --> 00:28:20,130
found a way to capture that value.

670
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:24,170
And there's look, there's al I guarantee there's other open source project.

671
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,170
This is happening to,

672
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:27,930
right where people are taking their websites, they're,

673
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:29,280
they're taking their downloads

674
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,010
and they're re hosting it.

675
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,819
And in some cases, it might be literal malware.

676
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:37,339
In some cases, it's gonna be just stuff like this where

677
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:40,770
maybe they're, they're honestly trying to be fans. I doubt it.

678
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,609
I suspect they're trying to sell ads.

679
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:46,280
No, they're stealing ad revenue. Right. They're straight up stealing ad revenue.

680
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,660
-- Like
-- this is,

681
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,040
this is not going to slow down.

682
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:52,010
We're going to see more and more of this as

683
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:55,050
just everything around us grows and it's growing exponentially.

684
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,677
And the problem with that exponential growth

685
00:28:56,687 --> 00:28:58,526
is when you notice exponential growth,

686
00:28:58,536 --> 00:28:59,546
it's too late.

687
00:28:59,857 --> 00:29:01,807
And that's, I think the thing

688
00:29:02,026 --> 00:29:05,427
that is, is starting to boil the minds of a lot of people.

689
00:29:05,437 --> 00:29:05,727
And in fact,

690
00:29:05,737 --> 00:29:08,847
this was a theme at cipher con I noticed is a lot of

691
00:29:08,857 --> 00:29:13,366
talks were basically saying nothing we used to do seems to work anymore.

692
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,967
What should we start doing now? And of course, there were lots of, oh,

693
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:20,327
we should start doing this thing instead. And it's like you're making this crap up.

694
00:29:20,337 --> 00:29:20,947
But

695
00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:22,057
the fact is

696
00:29:22,254 --> 00:29:24,673
everyone is starting to realize like the things we used to

697
00:29:24,683 --> 00:29:28,313
do don't work and they aren't working because exponential growth.

698
00:29:28,524 --> 00:29:31,553
Well, it's the law of large numbers kicked in a long time ago.

699
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:34,274
But nobody noticed because like you said, when, by the time you notice it,

700
00:29:34,284 --> 00:29:35,254
it's too late.

701
00:29:35,384 --> 00:29:36,114
No, I mean, and,

702
00:29:36,124 --> 00:29:40,473
and there's corner cases like weirdos like me who read every single CV and noticed

703
00:29:40,624 --> 00:29:41,514
it's getting busier,

704
00:29:41,663 --> 00:29:44,114
-- like a lot
-- busier. It can't anymore. But,

705
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:48,394
but even when you were doing that cart, it was linear growth in those days,

706
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,100
we've, we've exceeded the point of linear growth.

707
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,691
I mean, this is part of the reason I know NVD

708
00:29:53,821 --> 00:29:56,360
and everyone's pretending it's gonna go back to normal and they're saying, oh,

709
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:59,041
it was just a minor blip in our funding and stuff

710
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:02,500
like the numbers like, no, it's exponential growth.

711
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,541
I like how they put up a new notice and it's a very soothing blue.

712
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,151
Yeah, it is. Now that you say that

713
00:30:07,311 --> 00:30:07,901
-- it's a
-- very

714
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:08,161
soothing

715
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,770
-- shade of blue. It's quite, quite lovely,
-- exponential growth. You

716
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,860
-- everything, everything
-- happening.

717
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,791
And so

718
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:15,329
I

719
00:30:15,449 --> 00:30:17,400
think, and this is going to sound weird,

720
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:20,609
but I think one of the one of the effective ways

721
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:23,569
that we as humans can deal with this sort of whole mess

722
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:27,079
is having stricter attention filters

723
00:30:27,989 --> 00:30:29,650
where, for example,

724
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:33,349
I don't follow a lot of people on Mastodon because there's like

725
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:36,699
a damn near infinite number of interesting things to follow on Mastodon,

726
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,339
but I don't have time for it.

727
00:30:38,719 --> 00:30:41,849
Um Same thing with blogs, same thing with articles, news, you know, I,

728
00:30:41,859 --> 00:30:43,689
I found out about that interesting gold heist

729
00:30:43,699 --> 00:30:45,410
last year in Toronto at Pearson airport,

730
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:45,619
right?

731
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:45,984
When I uh

732
00:30:46,364 --> 00:30:49,864
some other uh the L A heist came up and somebody was mentioning this Toronto Heist.

733
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:51,584
So I'm like, I didn't even know about this.

734
00:30:51,594 --> 00:30:53,185
I was a Canadian shouldn't I know about this.

735
00:30:53,314 --> 00:30:55,064
I have a suspicion they weren't

736
00:30:55,204 --> 00:30:57,015
blasting that news.

737
00:30:57,135 --> 00:30:57,724
Uh Well,

738
00:30:57,734 --> 00:30:59,525
it was on the media but it was also one of those kind of

739
00:30:59,535 --> 00:31:01,824
like classic Canadian gold heist where the guy came in and said like,

740
00:31:01,834 --> 00:31:03,805
hey, I'm here for the gold and they're like, OK,

741
00:31:04,354 --> 00:31:06,415
and then he left with a bunch of the gold and

742
00:31:06,545 --> 00:31:07,145
there was like

743
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:08,560
that was it.

744
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,520
I know that's, that's good. Social engineering, well done.

745
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:14,800
But regardless, regardless of all that, here's

746
00:31:14,979 --> 00:31:17,760
how I want to end this and it's not a good ending,

747
00:31:18,069 --> 00:31:19,599
but the reality is

748
00:31:19,829 --> 00:31:21,260
the whole world

749
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:22,640
is growing

750
00:31:22,819 --> 00:31:24,439
in an exponential manner

751
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,739
in all of our

752
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:28,430
tooling, especially in the world of security.

753
00:31:28,439 --> 00:31:31,680
All of our ideas and tools were basically outdated.

754
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:34,349
-- A couple of years ago, I would
-- say a decade ago

755
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:34,869
maybe,

756
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,060
but it's not like linear out dating,

757
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,229
right? It's exponential. So like

758
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:44,119
two years outdated on an exponential curve is more like 20 years outdated.

759
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:44,670
And I think

760
00:31:45,099 --> 00:31:47,839
the problem is we keep talking about

761
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,839
all of these problems as like these

762
00:31:50,849 --> 00:31:54,079
individual singular events we can handle and deal

763
00:31:54,089 --> 00:31:59,510
with and solve when we need to think about things like in larger context,

764
00:31:59,520 --> 00:31:59,709
right?

765
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:00,260
This is

766
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:03,819
this is the problem that we have now is we

767
00:32:03,829 --> 00:32:07,170
can no longer obsess over like individual singular things.

768
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:09,930
This is a big data problem functionally.

769
00:32:09,939 --> 00:32:14,829
And we need to use like some big data tools which we are completely unprepared for.

770
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:16,329
I'd go a step further and say we need

771
00:32:16,739 --> 00:32:19,880
not just new technical techniques and research,

772
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:22,479
but we need new ways of thinking about this. So

773
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,719
a great example is I've classically said you can have bad security.

774
00:32:25,729 --> 00:32:28,500
This is like forestry management or health management. Where,

775
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,160
yeah, you're gonna have some sick people.

776
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:33,739
You're gonna have a forest fire once in a while. That's part of the ecosystem.

777
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,510
That's ok.

778
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:35,160
You know, I,

779
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:39,339
I'm noticing people are starting to talk about data breaches in the sense of like,

780
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,199
yeah, they happen,

781
00:32:40,439 --> 00:32:43,229
it sucks, but they happen and we can't really stop them.

782
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,589
And then a lot of people get very upset

783
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:47,920
about that saying that's a defeatist attitude and everything.

784
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,390
And it's like, well, but it's also the truth.

785
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:55,099
It's kind of like if you look at public health emergencies,

786
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,579
generally speaking,

787
00:32:57,969 --> 00:33:03,060
there's not tons of effort put into, like, for example, pandemic prevention,

788
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:05,900
but there is a lot of effort put into like,

789
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:09,819
handling a pandemic because the reality is you can't prevent

790
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,550
-- a lot of this sort of stuff.
-- We can't get people to wash their hands.

791
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,540
I know. Right.

792
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,060
And no,

793
00:33:15,069 --> 00:33:17,630
this is why I won't shake hands in public anymore is I actually have been paying

794
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,088
attention to other people in the bathroom and if they wash their hands or not,

795
00:33:21,197 --> 00:33:25,887
-- and I've noticed quite a lot of men don't wash their hands.
-- Oh, I know.

796
00:33:25,897 --> 00:33:29,738
It's horrifying. I was just at a conference. Yeah. Tell me about that.

797
00:33:29,968 --> 00:33:30,358
Right.

798
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,978
Like, I, like, I,

799
00:33:31,988 --> 00:33:35,777
I personally think there needs to be a video camera on the way into the

800
00:33:35,787 --> 00:33:39,248
bathroom that takes a picture of your face and a set of cameras at the sinks

801
00:33:39,397 --> 00:33:44,177
and if you walk out without washing your hands, a giant alarm and horn goes off and

802
00:33:44,316 --> 00:33:46,975
lights show on you and like, you know,

803
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:49,666
like dirty hand disgusting person don't wash their hands.

804
00:33:49,745 --> 00:33:50,776
I'd be ok with that.

805
00:33:50,916 --> 00:33:52,076
-- Ok?
-- No, no, no, no.

806
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,135
I, I appreciate

807
00:33:54,385 --> 00:33:57,495
your, like, internal hatred for this topic.

808
00:33:57,735 --> 00:34:01,026
But the reality is this, this is, this is exactly the right example.

809
00:34:01,036 --> 00:34:02,615
And I want to end it on this is

810
00:34:03,005 --> 00:34:08,125
you're talking about like an individual solution to a group problem.

811
00:34:08,614 --> 00:34:08,983
Well, yes,

812
00:34:08,993 --> 00:34:11,214
shaming people for not washing their hands would be

813
00:34:11,224 --> 00:34:14,273
like lovely and it would make me very happy.

814
00:34:14,444 --> 00:34:16,674
But the reality is like, statistically speaking,

815
00:34:16,684 --> 00:34:18,592
some percentage of people don't wash their hands,

816
00:34:18,603 --> 00:34:20,063
it's probably a pretty high percentage.

817
00:34:20,072 --> 00:34:22,342
And so the correct response is to just

818
00:34:22,523 --> 00:34:25,803
not touch people's drummy disgusting hands,

819
00:34:26,003 --> 00:34:29,033
right? Versus trying to get them to change their behavior.

820
00:34:29,043 --> 00:34:30,664
If you'll notice at the CS A booth,

821
00:34:30,674 --> 00:34:34,092
there's always a little cardboard thing propped up on them desk because behind

822
00:34:34,101 --> 00:34:38,172
it there's like a half gallon hand sanitizer pump that's been there for like

823
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:38,751
the,

824
00:34:38,761 --> 00:34:41,851
the person who has been doing this for 20 years and they know so there's always

825
00:34:41,862 --> 00:34:45,440
been like half a gallon of hand sanitizer at the CS A booth at every conference.

826
00:34:45,652 --> 00:34:46,612
And like,

827
00:34:46,621 --> 00:34:48,871
everybody is religiously like every five minutes

828
00:34:48,882 --> 00:34:51,141
like a sushi chef sanitizing their hands

829
00:34:51,271 --> 00:34:53,092
and I learned that from this person. And I was like,

830
00:34:53,402 --> 00:34:56,672
-- yeah, thank you for teaching this to me because it's
-- something to do.

831
00:34:57,419 --> 00:35:00,870
All right, that's a terrible story to end on. So I'm ending on it. Thank you. Thank
