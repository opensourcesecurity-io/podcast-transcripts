Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 73

1
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,819
with myself Gert Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:11,829 --> 00:00:12,600
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:15,810
-- How are you doing, Kurt?
-- Very well.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,309
Enjoying the ski season.

5
00:00:17,889 --> 00:00:19,920
Enjoying good. That's awesome.

6
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:24,969
So, I have a story to tell that's related to security, but in,

7
00:00:24,979 --> 00:00:26,530
in a kind of a roundabout way

8
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:32,650
I got suckered into running the concession stand during my son's swim meet,

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,040
like, pretty much forever. Right. This is certainly one of those.

10
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:40,049
There are various swim meets during the year

11
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,720
and I'm certain now that I've touched it last, I'm in charge and that's fine.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,569
Right. I think it'll be ok.

13
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,169
But

14
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,250
so

15
00:00:47,459 --> 00:00:49,639
everyone thinks I'm magic

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,380
because I made a spreadsheet to track inventory as

17
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:56,240
well as how much stuff we're buying and,

18
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,650
and this is crazy

19
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,220
and profit.

20
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,900
So we know what, what made money and what didn't,

21
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,699
what were they doing before? Just a bag of money.

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,930
Yes,

23
00:01:07,989 --> 00:01:10,199
that is exactly what they were doing before.

24
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:10,959
And,

25
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:11,540
but,

26
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,230
but I was thinking about this and the fact that I

27
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,260
literally spent maybe one hour of my life and I've revolutionized

28
00:01:18,559 --> 00:01:20,500
this kind of committee

29
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,010
for this swim team

30
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,010
because I'm doing things like math. Right. And,

31
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:29,690
and it occurred to me that this, this is, this is security's problem. Right.

32
00:01:29,699 --> 00:01:30,339
We are,

33
00:01:30,349 --> 00:01:35,309
we are the people like running around and just buying random crap and having no idea

34
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:38,470
what if it works or if it doesn't work or if it makes sense or,

35
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:40,569
or there were some instances where they were actually

36
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,510
selling things that were making literally zero profit.

37
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,269
Like, why, why, why would you do that? That's insane. And it

38
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,389
surprise me if they

39
00:01:49,129 --> 00:01:50,029
bring people in.

40
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,510
No,

41
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,500
it wasn't a loss leader. It was like sandwiches.

42
00:01:55,029 --> 00:01:56,309
But anyway, anyway,

43
00:01:56,419 --> 00:01:57,089
and, and

44
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:02,589
it occurred to me though, this is security's problem. We don't measure what we do.

45
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:07,180
And so we just do crazy things that we don't even know if it makes any sense.

46
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,529
And as soon as you start writing this stuff down,

47
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,490
it becomes really obvious what is a good idea and what is a bad idea, right?

48
00:02:15,339 --> 00:02:15,839
And it,

49
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,889
I just had that as we

50
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,440
were discussing earlier. I,

51
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,490
so the, the I want a CV and I need a CV.

52
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,089
Request form, goes to a spreadsheet with about 230 ish entries

53
00:02:27,309 --> 00:02:30,770
and I went through last night classifying them all as either basically, OK,

54
00:02:30,779 --> 00:02:33,389
like the request is well formed and I can do it

55
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:37,009
or there's something wrong with the request like there's no reference URL or it's a

56
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,889
bad reference URL or the descriptions all mangled and kind of how it's mangled and

57
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,490
and now I have data and the beauty is like 10% of them.

58
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,190
The description is missing the version

59
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:49,410
of the product that's affected and then there's 10%

60
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,880
as well that are missing the actual like product.

61
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,559
So it literally will say something

62
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,369
like there's a cross site scripting vulnerability

63
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,729
like that's the description they're using of this phone. It's kind of like

64
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:02,910
it would be probably helpful to have a product name and version in there as

65
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,050
well,

66
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:03,940
just saying it right?

67
00:03:04,899 --> 00:03:06,500
And the good news is like the majority of them can

68
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:08,839
easily be salvaged because I asked for that data elsewhere.

69
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,830
But here's the takeaway. I have actually learned something from this

70
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,169
which is,

71
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,919
I can't make people write the descriptions because

72
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,610
at least 20% of them will get mangled.

73
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:21,089
So I'm basically going to generate the descriptions from the data.

74
00:03:21,779 --> 00:03:22,699
That's a great idea.

75
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,729
But and the beauty is I can say that and I actually have data to back

76
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,570
it up now because I can quantitatively say 20% of these people will mangle it and,

77
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,500
and in fairness,

78
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:33,039
like a lot of them clearly English is

79
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,369
not their first language or even third language,

80
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:35,660
you know.

81
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:37,130
So asking them to write

82
00:03:37,529 --> 00:03:40,669
a couple of well formed sentences is, yeah, it's kind of a chore.

83
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:44,789
Well, not just that, I mean, if you read the CV E descriptions,

84
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:47,229
they're written in a certain way Right?

85
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:52,399
And I always feel like this when I deal with lawyers where the lawyer

86
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,380
asks you what you want to say and then they turn it into lawyer speak

87
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,059
and, and I mean, security is really no different.

88
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,699
We have our own way of saying things. There are certain words that are used.

89
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:07,839
We don't actually have a really official standardized vocabulary.

90
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,229
It's not standardized, that's a really good point. It

91
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:12,339
is not standardized,

92
00:04:12,649 --> 00:04:13,880
-- you
-- know, what does trust mean?

93
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,600
What does security? What does availability mean? Right. Like

94
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,619
-- there
-- are
-- three podcast episodes, you just listed.

95
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,399
No, I get it. It's, it's crazy man.

96
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,089
But back to your crazy story

97
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,529
that, that, that's my story.

98
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:27,359
That's all.

99
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,829
-- And here's what
-- I love is,

100
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:31,630
is my first thought is it's great that you revolutionized this.

101
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,010
But does anyone sort of audit the books or are you

102
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:36,920
like pocketing like 500 bucks a week from the swim team?

103
00:04:36,929 --> 00:04:38,760
And that's why they've never turned a profit.

104
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,450
No, in my case,

105
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:45,059
I can't because I'm showing all the money moving through the system now.

106
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:48,540
So if I wanted to embezzle, I couldn't

107
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,899
because we basically, and in fact, what's really cool is I,

108
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,500
I did the kind of projected income

109
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,739
right from the event

110
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:57,899
and

111
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,170
we were pretty much on the nose.

112
00:05:00,179 --> 00:05:02,329
I mean, you're always going to be a little off because like, for example,

113
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:05,579
you let coaches come and just like take free soda and stuff like that

114
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,399
I'd actually be more worried if your number was correct.

115
00:05:08,589 --> 00:05:09,820
I would have been.

116
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:10,440
Yeah,

117
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:12,489
that, that, that wasn't going to happen.

118
00:05:12,859 --> 00:05:18,070
I, I was, I was probably within a 10% margin of error, which I think was pretty good.

119
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,049
Yeah. Right. Right.

120
00:05:19,059 --> 00:05:22,709
Most stores, if they could order within 10% of what they actually needed.

121
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,660
Yeah, I feel like they'd be pretty happy about that.

122
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,929
Yes. And we, we did well on inventory as well.

123
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,410
I don't think there is a lot left, which is ideal, right?

124
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,679
Because this is a sort of thing.

125
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:37,170
You don't want to have huge containers of crap stored in a closet somewhere.

126
00:05:37,619 --> 00:05:39,940
So anyway, but like I said, I just,

127
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:43,049
I kept thinking about security after this and the fact that we,

128
00:05:43,369 --> 00:05:47,329
we, we, the people just buying random crap

129
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:48,279
and,

130
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,670
and don't get me wrong,

131
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,940
I think more often than not, it does happen to work out.

132
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:58,329
But if you apply a little bit of, I guess scientific rigor to what you're doing,

133
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,000
I think you can definitely get a more positive result.

134
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,130
And the best part, here's the best part of this though.

135
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,839
And this is what really rings true to me when I think about the context of security is

136
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,600
I don't really want to do this.

137
00:06:10,609 --> 00:06:14,420
And so I'm going to try to find some schmuck to give it to as soon as possible.

138
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,000
But by writing it all down and showing things in documents,

139
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,269
I can easily hand this off to someone else and I don't have

140
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,160
to worry about them screwing it up or not knowing what to do because

141
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:29,079
it's, it's dead simple if it's written down. Right.

142
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,600
This isn't, I have to tell you what to do.

143
00:06:31,609 --> 00:06:33,799
And in fact, that's kind of what happened to me with, there were people,

144
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:36,010
like 700 people telling me what they did.

145
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:36,570
And I'm like,

146
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:41,640
I can't no, like what you said and what you said, don't even those conflict.

147
00:06:41,649 --> 00:06:44,910
So, one of you is lying or confused and, and that person over there,

148
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,179
I don't know what they did before.

149
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,640
You know, it's just, it's crazy.

150
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:49,359
Well, that's, that's my favorite

151
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:53,559
part of programming, right? Is that computers are fundamentally, really stupid.

152
00:06:53,859 --> 00:06:58,510
So you have to decompose the problem into ridiculously simple steps.

153
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:02,160
And the only way to do that is to actually understand the problem,

154
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,700
-- you know,
-- have you used a computer recently?

155
00:07:06,609 --> 00:07:08,980
Well, I mean, like, for example, with inventory, the fact that, oh,

156
00:07:08,989 --> 00:07:11,140
we could order more stuff so we don't sell out.

157
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:13,649
But then, yeah, like you said, we have to store it somewhere. Oh,

158
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:14,290
yes.

159
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,660
You know who's going to store it? How do we, you know, whatever, blah, blah, blah.

160
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,489
Right. Not me. That's the answer. Yeah.

161
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:21,429
So,

162
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,160
and, and that's what I always see, you know, whenever I see like an sap roll out,

163
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,660
it always ends up being like, you know,

164
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,260
three times over budget and taking an extra five years.

165
00:07:29,859 --> 00:07:30,190
Yes.

166
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,089
And you know, it keeps coming back to like, well,

167
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,790
Doris from accounting handles that function.

168
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:35,279
Well, what, what does she do?

169
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:38,369
I don't know, she just does it like she makes the invoices get paid.

170
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:39,320
Yes.

171
00:07:40,049 --> 00:07:43,059
Yes. I'm, I'm totally familiar with that.

172
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:46,609
You gotta love it, man. So, but anyway, anyway, it's

173
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,920
just, it's got me thinking now

174
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,600
about how do we, how do we make what we do more boring.

175
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:53,750
-- Yeah.
-- Well, one of my

176
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,470
questions when it comes

177
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:56,329
down, I've been thinking about this too because like,

178
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:00,070
for some types of security you can kind of run like a b, you know, tests,

179
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,320
like you can have a control group and

180
00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:03,279
an experimental group and see what's different.

181
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:07,369
The problem though is, you know, if, if somebody says like, hey,

182
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,040
let's install antivirus scanners on half our systems and not

183
00:08:10,049 --> 00:08:12,459
on the other half and see which half gets more infected

184
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:15,209
people are going to freak out because, you know,

185
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,769
there's that perception of allowing risk when you

186
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:19,959
could have not allowed it. Right. And,

187
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,230
yeah, I mean, how do you deal with that? Right. It's like the whole

188
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,149
um,

189
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:25,850
well,

190
00:08:25,859 --> 00:08:28,660
like that whole thing with kids not being allowed to be

191
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,040
outside on their own anymore because what if they get kidnapped?

192
00:08:31,049 --> 00:08:31,529
Well, but that

193
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:33,669
don't, I mean,

194
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:37,830
they're much more likely to like, choke on a bird or something ridiculous

195
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,179
than get kidnapped.

196
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,380
But

197
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:41,909
if it happens,

198
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:45,348
why didn't, you, you know, take steps to ensure it didn't happen.

199
00:08:45,828 --> 00:08:47,158
Right. And actually, uh, Schneer

200
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:49,359
had a post. Uh, I

201
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:51,508
read, I don't, I think it was last week, maybe

202
00:08:51,849 --> 00:08:56,340
where somebody on an airline or an airplane had sent their

203
00:08:56,349 --> 00:08:58,710
wi fi access point to like there's a bomb on board

204
00:08:59,169 --> 00:09:03,750
and of course, the plane was diverted and landed and it was this big to do

205
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:04,580
and, and Schneier

206
00:09:04,849 --> 00:09:08,010
was saying, you know, why, why are we letting ourselves be terrified? Right.

207
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:08,869
This is, this is your,

208
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,799
you're essentially letting like the whole Paris mantra win here.

209
00:09:12,099 --> 00:09:12,590
And

210
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,159
the thing I kept thinking of was,

211
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:18,070
let's think about this from the perspective of the airline,

212
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,900
they do nothing

213
00:09:20,349 --> 00:09:21,979
and there's one of two outcomes,

214
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:24,200
nothing happens or the plane explodes.

215
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,539
Well, number two, nothing happens when somebody calls the press.

216
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,219
But ok,

217
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:30,289
that,

218
00:09:30,859 --> 00:09:34,429
that, that's true. Maybe, maybe that's potentially a third.

219
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,169
But let's, let's ignore that for a minute

220
00:09:36,989 --> 00:09:37,719
and you've got

221
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,380
nothing happens, which is almost certainly what it will be.

222
00:09:40,429 --> 00:09:42,179
-- Well, in fairness
-- if the plane blows up though,

223
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:45,460
chances are nobody's going to ever know about the wi fi password being an issue

224
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:48,000
or the Wi Fi name being an issue.

225
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:50,049
Yes, that's

226
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:52,940
maybe, maybe we'll, we'll assume they do

227
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:56,580
because here's the thing. If nothing happens, people will say, oh, ok, who cares?

228
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,739
And maybe the press gets a hold of it and maybe they made

229
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,400
something to do about it and and the airline could easily just say,

230
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:03,219
look, people are acting like Children.

231
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,900
This isn't a story. It was just a stupid clown.

232
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,150
However, if something does happen

233
00:10:08,349 --> 00:10:10,700
now all of a sudden you're gonna have people saying

234
00:10:10,869 --> 00:10:15,070
you guys knew something was fishy and you did nothing. Explain yourselves.

235
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,679
Right. And, and that's the thing. It's easier

236
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,070
to do the ridiculous thing of divert the plane,

237
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,419
kick everyone off and arrest the guy who set his access point to that

238
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,239
than it is to do nothing

239
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:29,840
because it appears you're doing something even though it's probably

240
00:10:29,989 --> 00:10:32,969
useless and has a net negative impact on society.

241
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:33,280
Yeah.

242
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:34,780
The, the economist actually,

243
00:10:34,789 --> 00:10:35,919
I think it was the economist had an

244
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:37,849
article about this called the goalkeeper dilemma.

245
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:40,239
So in soccer, the goalkeeper, when they take a penalty shot,

246
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:43,989
they have to be seen to heroically doing something when statistically speaking,

247
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,640
they actually best thing is to like,

248
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,789
kind of stand in the middle, do nothing.

249
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:49,510
But if they do that and they

250
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:52,419
report on they're going to get murdered or boot off the field.

251
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:55,570
Right. Well, and literally murdered in some of these countries. Right.

252
00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:00,039
Well, he scored, he, he, that was an own goal and it was so like,

253
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:00,989
yeah,

254
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,760
that's not going to go well.

255
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:03,580
Um

256
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:05,380
but anyway, so,

257
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:06,340
and I mean,

258
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:10,179
well there was that case of where somebody found a note on a plane that said Bob

259
00:11:10,909 --> 00:11:12,479
and they took it to mean bomb on board.

260
00:11:12,489 --> 00:11:14,950
So, they land the plane, clear the plane, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

261
00:11:15,289 --> 00:11:16,809
Oh, my goodness. You know.

262
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,630
And yeah, I mean, it, it,

263
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,210
you know what this really reminds me of is

264
00:11:20,219 --> 00:11:22,969
this whole zero tolerance policy that is creeping into,

265
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:26,520
well, not creeping into society that is accepted by society on so many things and

266
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,030
for some zero tolerance makes sense.

267
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,270
But for other things, it's like we, especially when you're dealing, for example,

268
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,530
with little kids, it might be better to have a bit of leeway to like,

269
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,710
not expel them or, you know, uh

270
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,440
boot them out for a week, but actually just talk to them about it,

271
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,500
you know, and see if their behavior changes rather than, you know,

272
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,030
these draconian measures

273
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,940
where, you know, for example, kids get into fights at school and they,

274
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,299
they can't defend themselves because if they defend themselves,

275
00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:53,729
they'll get suspended as well.

276
00:11:53,739 --> 00:11:54,210
Right.

277
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:55,369
You know, and,

278
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,530
and then there's cases where even the kid did not defend themselves

279
00:11:58,539 --> 00:12:00,590
and they still got suspended for being involved in the fight.

280
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:01,609
And it's kind of like, yeah.

281
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,609
Ok.

282
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,369
Um, it's crazy, man.

283
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:07,890
Yeah. And I just think it's coming more, especially with, you know,

284
00:12:08,489 --> 00:12:10,349
things were essentially

285
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,530
the company can sort of externalize that cost to a large degree.

286
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,359
So one thing,

287
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:19,130
for example is I know the local ski hill now requires all their ski instructors to

288
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:22,280
pass a child welfare check. It's a police report

289
00:12:22,599 --> 00:12:22,859
making

290
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,400
-- sure that you're
-- not

291
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:23,859
a pedophile

292
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:28,289
-- or whatever a couple episodes ago. Yeah.
-- And, but it's like, this is on a ski hill.

293
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:29,890
This is a really public place.

294
00:12:30,979 --> 00:12:32,960
You know, the kids line up outside.

295
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:35,020
There's like a bunch of little flags with, like, pictures of,

296
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,169
I think it's animals and numbers.

297
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:38,429
Like, so, like, there's group, 1234 or whatever. Right.

298
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,109
The ski instructors grab their kids, go up the hill, do their thing,

299
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:44,289
ski lesson and then drop them back off that flag.

300
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:44,710
And I mean,

301
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,539
I'm just thinking like the the

302
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:52,340
yeah, the mechanics of like the risk profile here,

303
00:12:52,979 --> 00:12:53,880
you know,

304
00:12:54,169 --> 00:12:55,359
it's just ridiculous.

305
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,719
-- Yeah,
-- but here's the thing.

306
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,109
So you mentioned last time about this that the instructors

307
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:02,429
have to pay for this background check on their own.

308
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,469
-- Yeah,
-- they have to pay the 70 bucks for this background check as well.

309
00:13:05,729 --> 00:13:10,599
-- So
-- basically the ski hill is incurring zero cost to do this

310
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,340
and it's basically zero risk for them.

311
00:13:13,349 --> 00:13:16,559
I mean, the only potential risk is they don't have enough ski instructors,

312
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:20,919
but I assume there are more than enough if they're willing to do something like this,

313
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:23,630
which means from the ski hills perspective,

314
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,940
there's literally zero negative to this even

315
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,700
though it's insane because let's face it,

316
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,549
you know, they're doing this.

317
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,960
Are you still skiing there? I assume? Yes.

318
00:13:31,229 --> 00:13:35,559
Right. So, so there there's literally zero downside to them

319
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:39,450
and the potential upside is if something does happen, they can say, hey,

320
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,450
they passed the background check, not our fault, you know,

321
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,169
go talk to these background check people

322
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,500
on the flip side though. I sometimes wonder about just making all this, like

323
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:50,059
in, you know, making all the tax returns public.

324
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,099
I, you know, there's a couple of Scandinavian countries that do that.

325
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,729
And so I just kind of wonder about rather than, you know,

326
00:13:55,739 --> 00:13:57,619
having these systems where we incur these costs,

327
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,369
why not just make all this data public

328
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,090
because the privacy advocates would lose their minds

329
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:03,770
true.

330
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,210
But I mean, I,

331
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,099
well, and in fact, so that that sort of happened though

332
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,049
in the US where we have,

333
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,900
there are uh,

334
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:14,200
no, no, not

335
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:14,609
Equifax.

336
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,349
When, when someone is convicted of

337
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:19,820
a sex crime against a child,

338
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:24,679
they go into the national Sex offender Registry

339
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:27,539
and you can kind of, you can go and say, like,

340
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:31,700
show me all of these sex offenders who live within a one mile radius of my house.

341
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,059
And you know, what has been the result of this?

342
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:38,719
It is primarily been used to depress property values in

343
00:14:38,729 --> 00:14:42,099
places that have a large concentration of sex offenders.

344
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:44,940
And, and I understand the intent

345
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,809
is because you want to give people the ability to kind of

346
00:14:48,979 --> 00:14:53,260
police themselves a little bit and understand what's going on. But the reality is

347
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:56,260
that's not exactly how it's worked out and

348
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,419
it's,

349
00:14:57,909 --> 00:15:01,900
-- well, this is a tricky problem,
-- man. That's one of my favorite. Second.

350
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:03,849
Or third order effect stories is, you know,

351
00:15:03,859 --> 00:15:06,679
a lot of the police services now put the crime maps online,

352
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:09,380
like they put the crime data online in a GIS database.

353
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,580
So you can like do a search like say,

354
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,979
you know, all breaking enters in my neighborhood in the last six months.

355
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,880
I will point out that elastic search does a very nice job of doing this.

356
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:19,419
In fact,

357
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:24,419
I I took a training class and this is one of the things we did is they took the Chicago

358
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,780
Crime Database.

359
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,400
Uh and we imported it into Elastic Search and then we mapped all

360
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:34,280
of the crimes committed in the city of Chicago over like a one month

361
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:34,659
period.

362
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:38,469
You know, one of the second order effects they found in London is that

363
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:40,940
people were actually uh rather

364
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:45,880
property owners were not reporting property crimes as much because

365
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:48,929
they didn't want to depress property prices in their area.

366
00:15:49,469 --> 00:15:52,580
Um On the flip side, I was watching a vice news thing yesterday

367
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,659
and this Italian police force in Milan, the city police,

368
00:15:56,669 --> 00:16:00,419
one of their guys Breitbart came up with the idea of this whole mapping,

369
00:16:00,429 --> 00:16:01,909
the crimes out and getting details.

370
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,609
Like, you know, was the guy left handed or right handed?

371
00:16:03,619 --> 00:16:05,739
What kind of shoes did he wear? What did he say?

372
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,030
You know, so that they can match up his crimes?

373
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:08,940
And so for example,

374
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,159
this one guy who was robbing pharmacies between four

375
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:13,309
and 7 p.m. on Wednesdays in a certain neighborhood.

376
00:16:13,429 --> 00:16:16,530
So they flooded the area with police for those three

377
00:16:16,539 --> 00:16:18,460
hours and I think they ended up catching him,

378
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:19,010
you know,

379
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:23,289
so that kind of predictive crime modeling can be very powerful, you know.

380
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,719
Um, at

381
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:28,210
the same time, yeah, there's all these unintended consequences.

382
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,000
Um I think what it really boils down to, uh, well, to go off on a tangent there.

383
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:35,880
Did you see that there was a paper written by some smart people

384
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,159
including Adam

385
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:37,559
sack

386
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,919
voluntary reporting of cybersecurity incidents and it talks about

387
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:45,479
people reporting cybersecurity incidents so that we

388
00:16:45,489 --> 00:16:47,099
can learn from them and avoid them.

389
00:16:47,109 --> 00:16:50,669
And my first thought was wow, this, this just absolutely won't work at all

390
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,869
because number one, we don't even have good detection of incidents.

391
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,159
Number two

392
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,700
as well. Uber, right.

393
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:02,030
They paid 100 grand to the hackers to try and, you know, just delete the data,

394
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:03,570
promise you deleted data.

395
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,030
No, take backs swears these,

396
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,810
you know, and covered that up.

397
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:10,020
And so apparently now there's a bill being introduced to make

398
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,250
it a criminal offense to like cover up a data breach.

399
00:17:12,979 --> 00:17:13,750
Um

400
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,130
And it just gets to me that we don't have good data,

401
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:22,239
the data, you know, a lot of companies will try and hide these things.

402
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:26,858
But even if for the sake of argument, we had complete reporting of all this, you know,

403
00:17:26,868 --> 00:17:29,119
what recommendations would we come up with and assuming

404
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,020
we could even then come up with recommendations,

405
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,000
getting people to implement them correctly.

406
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,829
You know, because we're just at such a, a

407
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:38,819
fundamentally not mature stage compared to say

408
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:39,900
the airlines,

409
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,939
you know, for safety for security. And even they're terrible at this.

410
00:17:44,459 --> 00:17:48,239
They, they are terrible at this and, but they got to where they're at today

411
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:53,030
by screwing up a lot and learning lessons, we screw up a lot.

412
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,770
But I don't think we learned very many lessons.

413
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,680
Well, you know, I was thinking because I,

414
00:17:56,689 --> 00:17:59,459
I see these ads for all these conferences and

415
00:17:59,739 --> 00:18:04,439
I was thinking like, what actual benefit and actionable thing is coming out of this?

416
00:18:04,449 --> 00:18:06,479
Like, are people, for example,

417
00:18:06,489 --> 00:18:09,650
taking these hardware hacking classes and actually making more secure hardware?

418
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,300
I don't know.

419
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,020
Like I have no idea

420
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,739
what is the return on investment for Black Hat training?

421
00:18:15,069 --> 00:18:16,020
II I

422
00:18:16,239 --> 00:18:20,420
-- straight up have no idea.
-- I would be surprised if it's positive.

423
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,790
Well, and then I, I think about things like, you know,

424
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,569
how terrible would the world be without something like PC I DS s to make sure that,

425
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:26,969
you know,

426
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,635
credit card processes are at least

427
00:18:29,814 --> 00:18:31,734
patching their systems and running A V.

428
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:33,435
It would be terrible man,

429
00:18:33,704 --> 00:18:35,584
like unquestionably terrible.

430
00:18:36,005 --> 00:18:40,155
And that's one of the things I love is people are always, you know, mocking check

431
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:41,834
check box security

432
00:18:41,964 --> 00:18:44,834
and how your compliance doesn't matter and stuff. And it's like

433
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:51,000
you're not wrong. But what does it say about an organization that doesn't have that

434
00:18:51,369 --> 00:18:51,839
right.

435
00:18:51,969 --> 00:18:53,010
I mean, come on.

436
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:57,550
Well, I love that, you know. Do you use source control? And the answer is not always.

437
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,930
Yes. And it's like, how is that? Even a thing in 2017?

438
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,369
I, I don't know, man. It, I don't know.

439
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,719
Well, anyways, uh, switching gears, it's coming up on Christmas.

440
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:13,760
-- Yes.
-- The topic at hand. So last year we talked about the security of Santa

441
00:19:14,729 --> 00:19:19,030
and I thought this year it would be fun to talk about security from Santa

442
00:19:19,349 --> 00:19:21,150
where we, we take the

443
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:24,739
position of adversarial Santas. Be it

444
00:19:24,949 --> 00:19:28,589
the Santa or, or we'll say some, some copycats

445
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,619
and I just have a friendly chat about some of

446
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:35,510
the silly stories I found and I did some searching and

447
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:36,680
it was,

448
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,550
yeah, it was fun. I, I will say though my first search was just for uh Santa crimes.

449
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,479
I think I typed in

450
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:46,400
uh it sounds like Santa Clara California has a lot of crime

451
00:19:46,849 --> 00:19:50,060
because that's, that's basically all I got.

452
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,420
But, but anyway, anyway, that's neither here nor there.

453
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,260
So we should start with the,

454
00:19:56,270 --> 00:20:00,619
the first story that I think is kind of the biggest and craziest

455
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:01,709
is

456
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:04,380
there's, it has its own Wikipedia page

457
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,939
and they call it the Santa Claus Bank Robbers.

458
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:12,459
And basically what happened was in 1927 in Texas,

459
00:20:12,469 --> 00:20:15,900
there were some people who robbed a bank dressed as Santa

460
00:20:16,229 --> 00:20:19,859
and they ended up with hostages and there was like this crazy gun fight.

461
00:20:19,869 --> 00:20:21,939
According to the Wikipedia article,

462
00:20:21,949 --> 00:20:25,630
something like more than 100 gunshot bullets were fired

463
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,969
between robbers and police and even like citizens who showed up with guns, which

464
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:35,719
-- sounds very Texas to me.
-- Well, it's, that's happened several times. Um,

465
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:40,050
what was that mass shooting with a tower at the university in Texas? And,

466
00:20:40,349 --> 00:20:44,119
you know, civilians were providing like covering fire for the police.

467
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,790
Uh, were they really, I don't know the story behind that. It wouldn't surprise me.

468
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,280
That was,

469
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:53,280
I do remember that, that, that was a terrible event. Definitely.

470
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:53,729
In

471
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,369
1966 the University of Texas Tower

472
00:20:57,609 --> 00:20:59,160
and the tower is still there, I think,

473
00:20:59,449 --> 00:21:01,119
which is kind of crazy. But

474
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:04,739
anyway, anyway, so there's big shootout

475
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:07,310
and the criminals end up,

476
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,859
some of them escaped.

477
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,530
Some of them didn't because they were shot

478
00:21:13,209 --> 00:21:15,469
and eventually they get arrested.

479
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:16,630
And

480
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:22,020
now the, the funniest thing though, the absolute best part of this story is in the,

481
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,229
in the notes I sent to you and I'll put this in the show notes.

482
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,369
There's a picture of Santa Claus,

483
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,869
right? It's like a hand drawn,

484
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:34,459
very sort of greeting card looking picture of Santa, right?

485
00:21:34,469 --> 00:21:36,229
This is something you'd expect on.

486
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:38,869
-- Right. Right.
-- Exactly.

487
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,969
Ah, that's the mug shot they published

488
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,709
for real.

489
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:48,160
That's, that's the picture the police put out asking,

490
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,209
identifying the criminal.

491
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:50,890
You know, it's a good

492
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:53,839
thing that didn't happen in the modern world because all those poor mall Santas.

493
00:21:55,290 --> 00:22:00,930
But it's a hand drawn picture of Santa. I mean, what, what do you expect?

494
00:22:00,939 --> 00:22:02,719
I mean, that's not, you can't,

495
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,250
-- you can't send
-- something like that.

496
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:06,849
That's awesome.

497
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,489
It's completely all I can figure is they must have found a

498
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,750
picture in a catalog or something and thought it would be funny.

499
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,150
I, it, it,

500
00:22:15,699 --> 00:22:20,069
whatever. I, I don't even understand how, how they did that. But, yeah.

501
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:20,160
Yeah,

502
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,030
I was reading up on this and I came across

503
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,890
a story that said that and that's why when you,

504
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,239
when you look up this particular story about Santa,

505
00:22:27,949 --> 00:22:30,040
that picture accompanies them all.

506
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:30,900
And it's because

507
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:36,130
it was the picture the police used like the wanted poster, right?

508
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:37,380
And

509
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,250
so anyway, anyway,

510
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:44,520
what happens though is the guy who commits the crime ends up getting arrested,

511
00:22:44,689 --> 00:22:49,560
they put him in jail, they find him guilty and he was sentenced to 99 years in prison.

512
00:22:49,589 --> 00:22:52,150
And apparently the people thought he should be put to death.

513
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,489
So they lynched him

514
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,369
because that's a very Texas thing to do, I guess. Also

515
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:05,619
-- it's just like you can't make this up
-- people when you subvert, when you subvert.

516
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:08,219
Symbols of good people do get cranky.

517
00:23:08,459 --> 00:23:11,099
-- Yeah,
-- that's probably fair. And especially in Texas, right?

518
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,270
And my favorite part here is so I was looking at the wiki

519
00:23:17,469 --> 00:23:17,609
page.

520
00:23:17,849 --> 00:23:20,020
No one was ever tried to associate with the lynching.

521
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,280
Although a grand jury was formed several

522
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,449
1000 persons viewed Ratliff's body the next day

523
00:23:24,459 --> 00:23:27,930
at a furniture store in Eastland before Judge Garrett ordered the corpse locked up.

524
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:28,359
Like,

525
00:23:28,849 --> 00:23:29,250
just,

526
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:32,550
I, I like how back in the day, like public hangings and stuff were, like,

527
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,630
bring the family and a picnic.

528
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:35,839
It's, you know, well,

529
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,910
it's fun for the whole family

530
00:23:38,219 --> 00:23:41,229
and they had publicly or public hangings in, you know,

531
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:43,680
some parts of the world up until what, like 19,

532
00:23:43,939 --> 00:23:46,510
the first or second decade of the 19 hundreds.

533
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:50,189
Well, even, even in France, I think they, they still, the last Guine

534
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:53,170
execution was what? In the seventies or something? Wasn't

535
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:53,719
it? Was that

536
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,920
the last public execution was

537
00:23:57,099 --> 00:23:58,119
1939

538
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,630
0 39? Ok.

539
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,579
And there's a picture of it and there was like straight up like a crowd like watching,

540
00:24:03,589 --> 00:24:04,219
you know, it's like

541
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,290
a really good street buster except, you know,

542
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,920
this is, I guess more right. Street cinema every

543
00:24:11,459 --> 00:24:11,530
day.

544
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,920
Uh Yes, it, well, it's the,

545
00:24:14,939 --> 00:24:18,520
remember all those good wholesome values people used to have.

546
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:19,839
Yeah, that's a lie.

547
00:24:20,569 --> 00:24:24,589
No, I, I know, man. Or you think about like gladiatorial combat even? Right.

548
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:27,119
I mean, people, they didn't go to watch people fight,

549
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:29,449
they went to watch one guy kill another guy.

550
00:24:29,459 --> 00:24:32,680
Let's face it. It's like, it's like people who like to go to car races,

551
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,180
mixed martial arts.

552
00:24:34,819 --> 00:24:35,479
Uh

553
00:24:35,719 --> 00:24:36,920
Yeah, that's, that's fair.

554
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:42,790
Did you see the thing on Reddit about the guy who was, was streaming on Twitch?

555
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,319
Like one of the pay per view, uh ultimate fighting things. I don't know what it was.

556
00:24:47,329 --> 00:24:50,420
He was like pretending to play a video game and you know how they

557
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:54,160
have the little little image of themselves in the lower right hand corner.

558
00:24:54,819 --> 00:24:55,829
He was,

559
00:24:55,839 --> 00:25:01,349
he was pretending to play the game like he was playing like two dudes fighting.

560
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:06,040
-- It was hilarious.
-- That's gonna happen. That must be a VR game already.

561
00:25:06,989 --> 00:25:10,180
I don't know. I mean, maybe that's an obvious contender for virtue.

562
00:25:10,189 --> 00:25:12,939
Like first person shooters, we've already got those in VR.

563
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,069
-- There must be like M MA games or whatever for V
-- R. Oh, there's tons of a man.

564
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:17,819
Definitely.

565
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:20,959
Anyway, it was,

566
00:25:21,199 --> 00:25:23,719
and he obviously streamed a pay per view match

567
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,359
and, and apparently because of the way it was done,

568
00:25:26,369 --> 00:25:29,239
none of the automated copyright systems kicked in

569
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:33,770
because it, it looked like a dude playing a game and let's face it too. Like a lot of

570
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,689
these games look

571
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:35,359
not

572
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:37,810
have by definition.

573
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:40,680
It wouldn't know the content to look for because it's being live streamed.

574
00:25:41,349 --> 00:25:45,939
-- I do not know
-- because like the copyright content violation system would have to have

575
00:25:45,949 --> 00:25:47,670
like every single live stream or every single

576
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,650
copyrighted thing to know what to detect.

577
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,890
-- I have no idea,
-- man.

578
00:25:50,989 --> 00:25:51,729
Or I guess you could

579
00:25:51,849 --> 00:25:53,849
embed a signal in the stream maybe saying like this is

580
00:25:55,569 --> 00:25:55,589
it.

581
00:25:55,849 --> 00:25:56,550
-- I don't
-- know. I

582
00:25:56,869 --> 00:25:56,890
know

583
00:25:57,189 --> 00:25:57,359
it was

584
00:25:57,469 --> 00:25:58,530
just, it was hilarious.

585
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,410
It, it made my day when I saw it,

586
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:07,569
it could be fake even. And I don't care, it was too funny. Anyway. So, so the next story

587
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:09,530
that I really like about Santa

588
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,530
is, uh,

589
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:13,800
apparently there was a man dressed as Santa

590
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:18,079
at a buffalo wild wings handing out marijuana,

591
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,890
which I guess is legal there now. So maybe that's

592
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:29,000
because I know we're looking at, uh, legalizing it here in Canada come July 1st of,

593
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:31,300
of next year, supposedly

594
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,060
for Canada Day. Right. And, um,

595
00:26:34,479 --> 00:26:35,319
yeah, I mean,

596
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,910
well, because you can't, like, go on the street and hand out beer,

597
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:40,130
you

598
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:40,489
can,

599
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:42,079
um,

600
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:42,810
you know,

601
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:43,530
the

602
00:26:43,709 --> 00:26:44,140
cop would definitely,

603
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:45,760
and I would

604
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:46,109
assume

605
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:49,729
even with legal marijuana that, that would still not be like

606
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:50,500
a lot.

607
00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:51,349
And that's,

608
00:26:51,689 --> 00:26:54,329
that's probably fair. So, anyway, he handed out, uh,

609
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:57,030
the packages of dope to people in the restaurant

610
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,969
and apparently saying I have a gift for you

611
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:01,010
and then left some in the tip jar

612
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:03,839
and then left and they found him and arrested him.

613
00:27:03,979 --> 00:27:04,520
Which,

614
00:27:04,849 --> 00:27:06,910
yeah, that, that seems pretty fair. You can't

615
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,150
hand something like that out. Well, it was technically illegal then,

616
00:27:10,579 --> 00:27:11,369
but, yeah, I,

617
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,510
it, it made me chuckle. That's

618
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,339
-- right. Go
-- Santa. Right.

619
00:27:15,349 --> 00:27:17,890
I mean, that's always one of my classic questions is, you know,

620
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,300
statistically if somebody,

621
00:27:19,829 --> 00:27:22,369
if I take something in public it's probably not going to be dangerous.

622
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,770
But if somebody hands me something like, what's their motivation?

623
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,910
Are they trying to mess with me? Are they trying to hurt me?

624
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,589
You know, this cookie, does it have a razor blade in it?

625
00:27:29,709 --> 00:27:33,469
-- You know, back to the old Halloween thing? No,
-- cookies have razor blades.

626
00:27:35,109 --> 00:27:36,079
No, II,

627
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,510
I do understand what you're saying and I think it's human nature

628
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,500
to question the motives of someone giving something away for free.

629
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,420
-- Well,
-- especially drugs,

630
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:49,310
uh, especially drugs. Yes,

631
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,250
indeed. It's,

632
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,420
now, now, I wonder though, is,

633
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:59,099
is that an innate human quality or is that just something that we've grown

634
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:03,260
to kind of develop as a trait given the world we live in?

635
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:07,060
Well, it makes sense because how many times, like, one of my kids would only

636
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:09,949
try new things if you took a bite

637
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:11,390
and he would, like,

638
00:28:11,609 --> 00:28:12,750
you would hand him something new,

639
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,510
like a cookie or whatever that he didn't recognize.

640
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,310
And he'd, like, he'd hold it and he'd look at it

641
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,189
and then he'd look up at you and hold it out to you

642
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:20,829
and if you didn't take a bite from it, there's no way he was gonna.

643
00:28:21,469 --> 00:28:22,040
And if you do the

644
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,530
thing, you better enjoy it.

645
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:29,050
Right. Yes. And I remember doing that with, with small Children for a long time.

646
00:28:30,219 --> 00:28:31,250
Interesting. And if

647
00:28:31,489 --> 00:28:36,280
I do that though, with people, I know where if they're like, oh, here eat this,

648
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,880
I'll say you take the first bite.

649
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:41,000
Right. And if they don't, then I know it's a bad idea.

650
00:28:41,609 --> 00:28:42,520
Right.

651
00:28:43,949 --> 00:28:46,250
Uh, in fact, I, I did this to people.

652
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:50,329
I know is there's, there's this hot sauce called Dave's Insanity sauce.

653
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:52,170
It's freaking hot.

654
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:54,939
Uh, you, I don't, but you could,

655
00:28:55,579 --> 00:28:56,160
and

656
00:28:56,329 --> 00:28:58,579
I, I've known people who would say, oh,

657
00:28:58,589 --> 00:29:00,859
I like spicy food and I would take out some

658
00:29:00,869 --> 00:29:03,650
crackers and put some Dave's Insanity sauce on each.

659
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,630
Done two crackers. I would eat one.

660
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:06,939
Then I'd let them eat one.

661
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:11,550
It doesn't bother me because I like really spicy foods and they would

662
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,339
not do well.

663
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,430
We'll say

664
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,729
it was hilarious. I loved it. They'd be like, why aren't you doing this?

665
00:29:19,739 --> 00:29:23,040
And I'd say I do this a lot. Actually, I, I'm good.

666
00:29:23,979 --> 00:29:26,010
It's like building up a tolerance to things.

667
00:29:26,439 --> 00:29:28,189
-- Uh,
-- it, it's very much like that.

668
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:31,670
Well, and I, I read once that people who love spicy food,

669
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,479
it's a similar reaction in the brain to cocaine.

670
00:29:34,489 --> 00:29:36,329
Apparently cocaine addicts

671
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:36,579
do

672
00:29:36,989 --> 00:29:38,640
-- stuff. Yeah. Uh,
-- something like that.

673
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:42,469
So, yeah, I'm basically like, hopelessly addicted to spicy food, which is fine.

674
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:44,609
I like my spicy food. So it's good. It's good.

675
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,400
Yeah.

676
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:45,689
Uh,

677
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:47,130
but anyway, anyway,

678
00:29:47,469 --> 00:29:48,219
I loved it.

679
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,619
So, so the, the next story

680
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:55,589
and this one is my favorite, I think of, of them. All right.

681
00:29:57,709 --> 00:30:02,609
So, so anyway, apparently an armed robber dressed as Santa

682
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,250
climbed through the drive through window of a Kentucky fried chicken,

683
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,569
demanded cash,

684
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:11,449
threatened the stamp of the knife and then, uh, took the cash and fled

685
00:30:11,989 --> 00:30:13,060
and I'm just thinking,

686
00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:15,819
why would you climb through the drive through window.

687
00:30:15,829 --> 00:30:18,729
Like what, what is the incentive to doing that?

688
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,380
And additionally, what is the staff doing?

689
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:24,069
Watching Santa Claus climb through the drive through window?

690
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:26,920
Are they like, what's going on here? My first thought would be part

691
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:27,689
-- of
-- this person

692
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:28,420
doing drug

693
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:31,540
is that it's so unexpected and weird

694
00:30:31,819 --> 00:30:33,109
that you, you just,

695
00:30:33,589 --> 00:30:37,979
a lot of people will just freeze up and be like, what like am I really seeing this?

696
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,020
That, that's probably fair. And in fact I've,

697
00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:41,890
yeah,

698
00:30:42,089 --> 00:30:44,469
I find myself in that situation many times

699
00:30:45,589 --> 00:30:47,219
people trained to deal with weirdness.

700
00:30:47,229 --> 00:30:47,500
So, I mean,

701
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,219
the greatest example being the cops here in Edmonton that had to deal with that

702
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:52,209
sort of terrorist attack.

703
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,150
And, you know,

704
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,660
so the guy runs over a cop with his car and the cops are kind of like what's going on

705
00:30:56,930 --> 00:31:00,949
and then he's in the bad guy, got a U haul van and he was like, driving on Jasper,

706
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:03,819
the main dr trying to run over pedestrians and the cops like, oh, ok,

707
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,060
stop him now,

708
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:06,530
you know, and

709
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:10,280
they're like, but you can hear initially they're just like, what the hell,

710
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:11,150
like we're chasing this guy.

711
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,829
What that, like, what? Like, this makes no sense, right?

712
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:17,750
This is not like a normal profile for a crime.

713
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:18,989
And, you know,

714
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:20,630
like,

715
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:21,829
yeah, like,

716
00:31:22,469 --> 00:31:22,800
I mean,

717
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,979
if Saint Nick climbed into my place of business

718
00:31:24,989 --> 00:31:26,930
through the drive through window with a knife,

719
00:31:26,939 --> 00:31:27,849
I'd be kind of like,

720
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,609
you know,

721
00:31:29,959 --> 00:31:29,989
what,

722
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,500
like did I get some

723
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:32,459
coleslaw?

724
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:34,439
Ok. That's fair. I think I would do the

725
00:31:34,729 --> 00:31:38,569
-- same
-- and, and I think a lot of these crimes are not particularly well thought out.

726
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:42,089
I don't think any crimes are particularly well thought out.

727
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:44,119
The Diamond Heist in Holland.

728
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,819
That one we talked about that way,

729
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,130
I think.

730
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:47,959
But, uh,

731
00:31:48,069 --> 00:31:48,719
yes.

732
00:31:48,989 --> 00:31:50,020
Yeah. No, it's

733
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:54,040
because I've seen that. Have you seen, there's a classic video where somebody is,

734
00:31:54,439 --> 00:31:55,810
uh trying,

735
00:31:55,979 --> 00:31:58,170
what is it? She wanted like chicken mcnuggets or something?

736
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:01,079
And she's like trying to climb in through an assault that

737
00:32:01,339 --> 00:32:03,290
mcdonald's worker through the drive through window and

738
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,170
the mcdonald's lady is trying to close it

739
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:07,829
and she's also taking another order or something

740
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:09,530
like she's used to this and it's just

741
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:11,589
-- like, it's just such a long
-- show.

742
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:12,339
Must

743
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,849
be part of the mcdonald's training program now. Right.

744
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,729
And defend yourself through.

745
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,160
I don't know. Oh, my goodness.

746
00:32:19,699 --> 00:32:23,089
But, uh yeah, I think, I think that's a lot of it. Like, because

747
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:23,790
yeah,

748
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,939
if you're going to commit a crime and you decide to dress up with

749
00:32:25,949 --> 00:32:29,449
Santa that says to me right there that like things are already going down.

750
00:32:30,589 --> 00:32:31,119
Yes.

751
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:32,550
Right.

752
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,030
Well, ok,

753
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:37,729
so this is one of the things I've been thinking about is if you dress up as Santa,

754
00:32:38,579 --> 00:32:41,500
are you just a crazy person who happens to be

755
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,829
dressed as Santa when you decide to commit a crime?

756
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:45,199
Which I'm sure that some of them are.

757
00:32:45,869 --> 00:32:47,020
There's some also that,

758
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:51,140
that part of their premeditation for crime was I know I'm

759
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:53,380
going to dress as Santa before I commit this crime.

760
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:55,729
What?

761
00:32:56,069 --> 00:32:58,790
Yeah. I don't know. I don't know, man, I love it. It's

762
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,709
researching these stories just, I got a laugh.

763
00:33:02,719 --> 00:33:06,469
There were, there, there are a lot, though. There's a lot of stories that it's just

764
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:09,479
basically someone dressed as Santa stole something

765
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,420
and

766
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:14,829
more than I could count and I only picked out the really silly ones. But it's like

767
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,920
this is, this is not an isolated incident.

768
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:20,550
Like it sounds like there are many,

769
00:33:20,569 --> 00:33:25,209
many thefts happening with people dressed as Santa every year on Christmas.

770
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:27,079
And I guess though at the same time

771
00:33:27,219 --> 00:33:28,520
you have the advantage,

772
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:32,589
there is no other time of the year you could dress in

773
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:35,569
a ridiculous costume and not have people think twice about it.

774
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:36,239
Right.

775
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,069
Uh, that is one day a year.

776
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:39,780
Right.

777
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,859
You certainly could. And, and actually

778
00:33:43,609 --> 00:33:43,689
until

779
00:33:43,849 --> 00:33:45,380
December 26th now,

780
00:33:45,969 --> 00:33:46,979
yeah, basically

781
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:48,040
it will be

782
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:50,699
Costco actually.

783
00:33:51,459 --> 00:33:53,760
Uh, they had their Halloween stuff out in, like, late,

784
00:33:53,979 --> 00:33:56,000
I think it was late August, early September

785
00:33:56,329 --> 00:34:00,319
and it was gone by the middle of October and they'd replaced it with Christmas stuff.

786
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:01,619
Isn't that neat?

787
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:01,920
So,

788
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:05,229
Christmas actually came before Halloween this year at

789
00:34:05,239 --> 00:34:07,619
Costco and about two or three other stores.

790
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,040
I'm pleased to say I did not notice that because

791
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,350
I don't think I've been to Costco since Halloween.

792
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:13,800
But still,

793
00:34:13,978 --> 00:34:15,918
oh, wait, you went to a Costco. You've joined.

794
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,600
I have a Costco membership.

795
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,820
We've got one.

796
00:34:18,938 --> 00:34:19,438
Yes,

797
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:19,688
a

798
00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:19,949
lot.

799
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:23,350
I have never had one of their hot dogs. Have a

800
00:34:23,458 --> 00:34:23,830
hot dog.

801
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,600
I

802
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,030
have bought very little there. It's,

803
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,629
it's one of those things, man. Costco is like

804
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:34,219
the ultimate store at abusing the human condition.

805
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:36,540
-- There's a
-- documentary about it specifically

806
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,449
how they just like trick you into buying.

807
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:39,188
That's

808
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:39,649
for example,

809
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:42,050
why they have the racetrack and no signs because you

810
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:45,340
have to walk through the entire store to find anything,

811
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:50,168
right? And I mean, they, they randomly move stuff around and like,

812
00:34:50,708 --> 00:34:51,599
yeah, no, I,

813
00:34:51,608 --> 00:34:55,197
I love it because it really appeals to my like hunting gathering instinct.

814
00:34:55,717 --> 00:34:58,479
No, I get it. Well, not only that, the other one is,

815
00:34:59,069 --> 00:35:03,368
my kids love the free samples and they'll try something and

816
00:35:03,378 --> 00:35:06,918
then say we should get this and I always say no,

817
00:35:06,928 --> 00:35:08,799
my wife's like, oh, it was good.

818
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:10,628
We could think about it. I think the

819
00:35:10,789 --> 00:35:10,888
only

820
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:11,099
reason

821
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:11,378
you

822
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:11,829
-- think
-- you should

823
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:13,269
maybe.

824
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:15,010
Well, that too. But

825
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,070
the thing is

826
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:18,110
by giving you free stuff,

827
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,469
you're, they trick us into thinking they're our friends

828
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,149
and we should

829
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:29,020
seriously and, and the nice people who hand them out are very friendly and it's like,

830
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:31,290
no, and I keep saying this to my family is they,

831
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,840
they're just tricking us into buying crap.

832
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:34,310
We don't need no, we're not getting that.

833
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,389
And of course, they, they think I'm some grumpy old,

834
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,709
you know, pain in the butt.

835
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:40,120
Yes,

836
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,429
they're not wrong

837
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:41,840
the

838
00:35:42,129 --> 00:35:42,239
maturing

839
00:35:42,399 --> 00:35:43,020
process

840
00:35:44,129 --> 00:35:46,840
anyway. Anyway. So, no, I'm, I'm not a fan of Costco.

841
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:49,790
The only thing I really like at Costco I will say

842
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:50,709
is

843
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,090
I can buy a giant can of tomato sauce.

844
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,580
So I only have to open one can instead of like 10 when I make

845
00:35:57,879 --> 00:35:59,290
it out of chili. That's

846
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,100
right. That's pretty much it.

847
00:36:02,929 --> 00:36:04,270
Anyway. Anyway,

848
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,419
we'll keep going. We'll keep going. So the next one is not a Santa related story,

849
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:12,820
but I, I had to laugh it anyway. And apparently, uh,

850
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,459
a, a baby Jesus statue was stolen from a nativity somewhere

851
00:36:17,899 --> 00:36:22,689
and they got it back because they had put a GPS transceiver inside of the statue.

852
00:36:22,699 --> 00:36:22,979
Well, this

853
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,889
thing and I'm thinking, what would

854
00:36:25,689 --> 00:36:28,110
-- you do that?
-- Because they probably get stolen all the time.

855
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,459
And it kind of reminds me of, um,

856
00:36:29,899 --> 00:36:33,139
uh, this is Christmas related but there's this Swedish town.

857
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:37,409
Um, that does a big straw, I wanna say a straw goat.

858
00:36:38,689 --> 00:36:39,379
Um,

859
00:36:40,129 --> 00:36:42,550
and then the, the, the thing gets burned down

860
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:44,899
like every year, like clockwork

861
00:36:46,189 --> 00:36:46,370
that

862
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,040
wait. Oh, people aren't supposed to burn. No.

863
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:49,639
Yeah,

864
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:50,219
I

865
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,830
don't know how to pronounce this in Swedish. The,

866
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:54,550
with an, um, lo

867
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:54,979
give

868
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:55,909
goat

869
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:59,669
is a traditional Christmas display, blah, blah, blah. Yeah, it's like a,

870
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:03,070
it's like a 23 story tall straw goat looks pretty awesome actually.

871
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:06,989
And, yeah, like, every year somebody burns that poor thing down.

872
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,050
Which, I mean, I,

873
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,610
I'm a law abiding citizen and even I want to burn something like that down.

874
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,469
If I saw it, you know, it's just be tempting.

875
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:16,520
It's like a big red stop button next to a bunch of computers. Right.

876
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,709
You just want to see what happens.

877
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:21,510
Right.

878
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,949
Anyway,

879
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,250
so, I, I think it makes sense for, like, in a neat,

880
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,139
because also GPS trackers are cheap now, right?

881
00:37:28,149 --> 00:37:29,679
You can put those things in your pet's collar.

882
00:37:30,629 --> 00:37:32,610
Yeah, that's probably true that it's fair.

883
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,739
The GPS tracker is probably cheaper than the new

884
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:35,050
stamps

885
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,199
that have them.

886
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,419
Right.

887
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:37,969
Right.

888
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:38,739
So

889
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,649
you've convinced me, I still think it's funny.

890
00:37:41,879 --> 00:37:42,610
It is funny.

891
00:37:42,879 --> 00:37:44,540
Yeah, I mean, more to the point like,

892
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,719
what are people doing with these baby Jesus Jesus?

893
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:47,550
I,

894
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,080
what's the

895
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,620
probably nothing?

896
00:37:51,629 --> 00:37:54,919
It's probably prankster kids who move them and think they're clever.

897
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:56,149
But

898
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,649
yeah, you gotta love it.

899
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:59,949
I, I don't know. I don't know, man.

900
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:01,520
Anyway, anyway,

901
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:03,280
uh, we'll, we'll skip over that one.

902
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,060
this one is also funny.

903
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:09,469
This is not technically Santa related but is, is Christmas related.

904
00:38:09,479 --> 00:38:12,229
Apparently there was a guy driving a, a

905
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:15,310
float in a Christmas parade

906
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:21,689
and it sounds like if you read the story, he got tired of being behind a slow tractor,

907
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:23,699
which everything in parades are slow

908
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:27,320
-- and he, uh, like passed it and then drove off
-- and

909
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:31,189
you know what I think, I think he was a dad and he just wanted to make good time.

910
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:32,919
We're not stopping, we

911
00:38:33,149 --> 00:38:33,909
make good time.

912
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:37,429
Uh, he had an open container of alcohol in the car

913
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,429
and was arrested.

914
00:38:38,439 --> 00:38:38,649
-- If
-- you

915
00:38:38,659 --> 00:38:40,929
-- had
-- to drive a car with more than six kids in it,

916
00:38:40,939 --> 00:38:42,540
you'd probably have an open container of

917
00:38:42,649 --> 00:38:43,120
alcohol.

918
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:44,030
I

919
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,750
am not going to comment on that.

920
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,580
This is one reason I think self driving cars are going to be awesome

921
00:38:48,739 --> 00:38:50,699
because you can now have a minibar in your car.

922
00:38:51,459 --> 00:38:53,439
Uh, self driving float.

923
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:54,919
That'll be interesting.

924
00:38:55,439 --> 00:38:58,439
Right. You've got a parade. It's something to drive a car,

925
00:38:59,229 --> 00:38:59,709
huh?

926
00:38:59,929 --> 00:39:01,209
I, I never really thought of that.

927
00:39:02,399 --> 00:39:03,929
Interesting. Although

928
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:07,449
when you have something like a parade

929
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:10,530
that can get interesting as well because often

930
00:39:10,919 --> 00:39:15,409
you violate numerous traffic laws during the route of parade.

931
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:18,129
So maybe they'll have like, special parade mode.

932
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:21,080
A parade mode with like a top speed of three

933
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:23,719
miles an hour because realistically at three miles an hour,

934
00:39:23,729 --> 00:39:24,360
not a lot of people,

935
00:39:24,899 --> 00:39:27,350
you definitely have time to react. You know, it's like that,

936
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:31,054
you know, you say that, but I bet a,

937
00:39:31,064 --> 00:39:33,574
a nontrivial number of people get run over in

938
00:39:33,584 --> 00:39:36,334
parades every year because while you're going slow,

939
00:39:36,344 --> 00:39:39,995
you often have incredibly limited vision as to what's happening around you.

940
00:39:40,004 --> 00:39:40,014
Oh,

941
00:39:40,314 --> 00:39:41,044
Lord. Yeah.

942
00:39:41,344 --> 00:39:45,135
11.5 million results for run over in parade.

943
00:39:45,415 --> 00:39:49,975
I, I'm not going to look it up. I don't want to. But I, I bet the number is horrifying

944
00:39:50,419 --> 00:39:54,310
and in fact, you know what's really annoying is there's a handful of local parades.

945
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,110
I've been to that.

946
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,199
They've stopped letting people throw candy because they're,

947
00:39:58,209 --> 00:39:59,439
they're tired of the mess.

948
00:40:00,229 --> 00:40:00,810
And

949
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:04,330
the part of me that cleans up, messes agrees with that.

950
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:08,090
But the, the human part of me says it's freaking candy and, you know,

951
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,489
kids and myself enjoy getting it, like throw the candy.

952
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:11,929
Come on.

953
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,209
Yeah. So anyway, right.

954
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:16,780
And, and now

955
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,290
we will, we will end this with the list.

956
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,570
I found a site

957
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,560
that listed the various crimes Santa commits

958
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:30,620
in the process of doing his activities and,

959
00:40:30,959 --> 00:40:34,419
and we'll start with the first couple makes sense and,

960
00:40:34,429 --> 00:40:36,060
and there shouldn't be a lot of,

961
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,739
I guess discussion around them necessarily.

962
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:43,209
But I, I find uh number five on my list to be the most interesting. Now,

963
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:44,189
here's

964
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:44,379
what?

965
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:46,639
Yeah, that number five because

966
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,169
let's start with five.

967
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,320
And now now just so you, everyone knows if,

968
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:52,250
if there will be a link to this in the show notes, the,

969
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:55,389
the order they list this stuff in is not the order I have it in

970
00:40:55,399 --> 00:40:57,629
because I took a couple of things out and we added a couple of things.

971
00:40:57,639 --> 00:40:57,929
So

972
00:40:58,209 --> 00:40:59,169
it's, it's very

973
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:03,340
related, but we'll start with five as it says, driving under the influence.

974
00:41:03,429 --> 00:41:05,050
Do people leave booth?

975
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:06,590
Well, and this also ties into

976
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,540
animal cruelty because

977
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,860
because I have been led to believe that the Reindeer are sentences.

978
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,560
They talk, they sing, they play games, they play

979
00:41:15,709 --> 00:41:15,929
reindeer

980
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:16,100
games,

981
00:41:17,139 --> 00:41:20,570
they do play reindeer games and they all talk and they Rudolph, the

982
00:41:21,189 --> 00:41:21,489
Reindeer

983
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,070
distress and they bully. So that sounds

984
00:41:24,389 --> 00:41:24,699
pretty

985
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:25,120
to

986
00:41:25,429 --> 00:41:25,469
me.

987
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:26,739
But, but

988
00:41:26,919 --> 00:41:29,439
is Santa forcing them into,

989
00:41:29,449 --> 00:41:32,100
are they suffering from some sort of Stockholm syndrome?

990
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:32,350
Like,

991
00:41:33,629 --> 00:41:35,729
I, I don't know, I mean, I don't know how this works.

992
00:41:35,739 --> 00:41:40,320
Maybe from the driving perspective, Rudolph, won't you guide my Slay tonight?

993
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:43,689
That sure sounds like Rudolph in charge he's navigating.

994
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:45,949
Uh Was he given a choice?

995
00:41:46,459 --> 00:41:47,110
Well, maybe,

996
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:47,780
I mean,

997
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:50,909
is your Uber driver truly given a choice or does he have to pay this month's rent?

998
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,290
Uh So Rudolph had to pay the rent. Is that what we're saying?

999
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:56,629
Stay

1000
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,699
with him for free

1001
00:41:58,379 --> 00:41:58,639
recovery.

1002
00:41:59,629 --> 00:42:01,010
They can fly

1003
00:42:01,129 --> 00:42:04,459
so he could probably go live anywhere he wanted to

1004
00:42:05,649 --> 00:42:05,820
leave?

1005
00:42:09,439 --> 00:42:13,600
I don't know. Although in the uh the Madagascar Christmas special,

1006
00:42:13,729 --> 00:42:19,129
the, the reindeer can only fly because of uh magic powder in Santa Sleigh.

1007
00:42:19,139 --> 00:42:23,379
So it could also be there's some sort of drug addicts that, that can only get the,

1008
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,840
the product from Santa. But

1009
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:27,590
-- anyway, like
-- the classic sci

1010
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,649
fi combat drug, alien thing.

1011
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,949
That's right. That's right. I think Star Trek covered it well.

1012
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:38,649
But, but anyway, number five was driving under the influence and it talks about,

1013
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:41,649
you know, Santa driving to Slay drunk essentially and

1014
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:44,379
like, do people leave booze for Santa

1015
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:45,560
I've never done.

1016
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:49,090
And my son actually has a theory that would also cover this because so

1017
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:53,060
you can drive depending on where you are 0.08 0.05 under the limit.

1018
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,209
So that's like one drink.

1019
00:42:54,969 --> 00:42:57,479
And my son's theory, well, he has two main theories about Santa.

1020
00:42:57,489 --> 00:42:59,560
Number one that Santa is the world's richest person

1021
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:00,989
because he can give away all this stuff.

1022
00:43:02,129 --> 00:43:05,639
It's not unreasonable. But his second theory is much more compelling to me. It's

1023
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:07,909
because he was trying to figure out how does Santa do all this?

1024
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,479
Right? Does he travel faster than light? Does he blah, blah, blah.

1025
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:14,489
-- And you know, he came up with clones,
-- clones

1026
00:43:15,149 --> 00:43:16,280
scale out, parallelize

1027
00:43:16,489 --> 00:43:17,030
the workload.

1028
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,860
That's not completely inaccurate,

1029
00:43:20,439 --> 00:43:21,620
-- I mean,
-- not wrong,

1030
00:43:21,739 --> 00:43:22,239
you know.

1031
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,770
And so here's the thing,

1032
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,879
if there's enough Santas doing this and they all

1033
00:43:25,889 --> 00:43:28,169
each only have like say one drink per hour,

1034
00:43:28,179 --> 00:43:30,530
then they would be able to stay under the legal limit.

1035
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,270
Uh

1036
00:43:32,459 --> 00:43:35,010
-- What? But what?
-- So if Santa's only

1037
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:35,469
assuming

1038
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:37,889
one alcoholic drink per hour is not gonna get

1039
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:38,860
like

1040
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,770
who's leaving booze for Santa? I

1041
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,090
better start doing that,

1042
00:43:43,439 --> 00:43:43,679
right.

1043
00:43:43,959 --> 00:43:45,219
That's what I'm saying.

1044
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:49,810
I want my kids to leave beer for Santa, right? Like hook me up there, Santa beer.

1045
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:55,260
Stupid Reindeer only get a carrot.

1046
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:57,570
Uh Anyway, anyway. All right.

1047
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:01,179
So, so let's, let's head to the top of the list because it's, it's fun, right?

1048
00:44:01,189 --> 00:44:06,409
-- Uh The obvious one is home invasion, trespassing.
-- Well, home invasion is not fun.

1049
00:44:06,439 --> 00:44:08,879
Uh It's, it's fun. They're all fun. Kurt. This is,

1050
00:44:09,409 --> 00:44:11,139
I was actually thinking about that. Like,

1051
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:14,379
what if people actually did invade homes and leave presents or clean?

1052
00:44:14,389 --> 00:44:18,600
-- That would be lovely.
-- Actually. What's really funny is my daughter asked me one day.

1053
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:19,459
Um, this is,

1054
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:22,000
I don't know, maybe, maybe a month ago she goes,

1055
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:23,850
who,

1056
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:25,669
what did she say? She says

1057
00:44:26,379 --> 00:44:29,879
Santa must be real because who else would break into your house and leave presents?

1058
00:44:29,889 --> 00:44:33,439
And I said criminals and she thought about it for like 30 seconds.

1059
00:44:33,449 --> 00:44:35,739
It goes, wait, they take your things, dad.

1060
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:37,750
Yes.

1061
00:44:37,989 --> 00:44:38,020
Well,

1062
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:42,219
uh, but anyway, so here's the question I have though

1063
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:43,040
is,

1064
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,439
is Santa trespassing

1065
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:48,760
if you leave him milk or beer and cookies?

1066
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:52,399
Because isn't that kind of like an invitation into your home?

1067
00:44:54,189 --> 00:44:55,320
Well, you know,

1068
00:44:55,429 --> 00:44:55,439
I

1069
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:55,780
was

1070
00:44:55,939 --> 00:44:59,409
because don't Children and parents write to Santa saying what

1071
00:44:59,419 --> 00:45:01,550
they want and it's kind of like here's the thing.

1072
00:45:01,969 --> 00:45:05,070
If you come onto my property, technically you could be trespassing.

1073
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,320
But like clearly if I call the cops and I'm like, hey,

1074
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,379
there's this guy dressed in brown leaving packages at my

1075
00:45:09,389 --> 00:45:11,350
door and I want you to get him for trespassing,

1076
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:16,070
they're going to be like, no, that's, that's the UPS guy or girl and like,

1077
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,370
please stop calling us,

1078
00:45:17,979 --> 00:45:18,510
you know.

1079
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,110
Right. And so like there's that implicit

1080
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:22,899
delivery thing.

1081
00:45:22,909 --> 00:45:24,840
Now, the question is, you know, for example,

1082
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:26,620
I've also had them open up the screen door and prop

1083
00:45:26,629 --> 00:45:28,590
the packaging between the screen door and the door door.

1084
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:29,090
Right.

1085
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:33,409
Yes. But, but how many UPS delivery people have come into your house?

1086
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:34,250
I don't have

1087
00:45:34,379 --> 00:45:34,439
Amazon

1088
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:35,179
key. So

1089
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:36,699
if

1090
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:36,909
I live

1091
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:37,129
in

1092
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:37,310
the

1093
00:45:37,429 --> 00:45:37,899
US,

1094
00:45:38,219 --> 00:45:41,709
-- but if I lived in the US, that would be a thing.
-- Oh my goodness.

1095
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:44,350
This Amazon thing is totally Santa Claus. Isn't it?

1096
00:45:44,379 --> 00:45:46,760
Like someone sneaks into your house while you're gone?

1097
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:52,050
You're gonna maybe you can tip your Amazon

1098
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:54,389
key delivery person with milk and cookies.

1099
00:45:55,770 --> 00:46:00,669
-- So
-- II I am thinking that there is like an implicit social contract here, like

1100
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:03,820
where, you know, like for example, the long guy, he can go on to your property,

1101
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,800
you know, the UPS guy can go onto your property and, and there's, you know,

1102
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:11,510
ups guys have also left packages on my back porch or under the mat or whatever, right?

1103
00:46:11,929 --> 00:46:12,860
And you know,

1104
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:16,469
uh if I could have them actually somehow safely put

1105
00:46:16,479 --> 00:46:18,570
the package inside my house without getting rob blind,

1106
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:21,929
I'd probably be ok with that because, you know, winter and stuff, right?

1107
00:46:22,429 --> 00:46:24,090
I don't want my packages freezing,

1108
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:24,850
but

1109
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:25,870
now thanks to

1110
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:26,179
Amazon.

1111
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:27,770
Well, not in Canada.

1112
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,070
Um,

1113
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:29,879
well,

1114
00:46:29,889 --> 00:46:35,459
I would say in general it's not trespass because there's probably that implied

1115
00:46:35,669 --> 00:46:37,320
or specifically, you know,

1116
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:40,959
the kids wrote a letter to Santa and the parents approved of it.

1117
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,020
-- Uh
-- Yeah, I, I would agree.

1118
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:47,810
I think we could probably strike that one off and say Santa is probably not,

1119
00:46:48,229 --> 00:46:49,860
probably not trespassing.

1120
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:53,459
And my assumption is people who don't want him to visit,

1121
00:46:53,649 --> 00:46:54,699
he will not visit.

1122
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:56,050
Well, the other thing is, for example,

1123
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:59,610
now he could be using like drones or he could be using all sorts, you know,

1124
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:01,580
like Amazon that last mile delivery where they have

1125
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:03,620
like the truck with drones that zip out,

1126
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:07,139
you know, and, and here's a question if I drop something down your chimney,

1127
00:47:07,149 --> 00:47:08,179
is that trespassing?

1128
00:47:08,189 --> 00:47:10,429
Like, what if I drop the packages down the chimney?

1129
00:47:10,439 --> 00:47:13,040
They bounce out of the chimney under the tree and they don't get dirty because

1130
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:16,120
I have, you know, nanofiber wrapping paper that's

1131
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:18,610
dust proof for repellent.

1132
00:47:19,129 --> 00:47:22,229
I'm not even going into us anymore. I'm just throwing packages down the chimney

1133
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:23,360
-- off
-- my roof.

1134
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,260
Is there a sign saying that

1135
00:47:25,989 --> 00:47:27,340
I'm going to make one?

1136
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:30,760
It says please stay off my roof.

1137
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:32,409
So,

1138
00:47:32,739 --> 00:47:33,610
anyway,

1139
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:34,399
uh,

1140
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:37,340
ok. So what about, uh, unlawful surveillance?

1141
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:39,909
Is Santa unlawfully surveilling us all?

1142
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:42,949
-- Uh Well, again, I don't
-- know,

1143
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:47,189
it probably depends on the country, right? Is Santa going to be GDPR compliant?

1144
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,780
Well, it depends on the country in the state.

1145
00:47:48,959 --> 00:47:53,030
-- I would also point out Santa has never had a data breach
-- that we know of.

1146
00:47:53,479 --> 00:47:53,989
True.

1147
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:58,584
I mean, he could be leaking information all over the place and, and he's just good,

1148
00:47:58,594 --> 00:48:00,584
he maybe has a really good pr department,

1149
00:48:00,905 --> 00:48:03,824
right? You don't, you don't hear a lot of negative Santa news.

1150
00:48:03,834 --> 00:48:07,665
It's generally positive. I think you could. It's safe to say his pr people.

1151
00:48:07,675 --> 00:48:10,425
-- They're
-- good, man. Oh, no, I got bad news for you. His, uh, no

1152
00:48:11,024 --> 00:48:13,094
got hacked last year in a massive data breach.

1153
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,219
Set an onion article. No.

1154
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:17,820
Well, yeah, kind

1155
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:18,050
of,

1156
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:22,989
kind of what Equifax is. Right. The naughty. Nice list of

1157
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:23,330
people.

1158
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,669
Yeah, pretty much.

1159
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,080
-- Or maybe Santa gets his data from Equifax.
-- I

1160
00:48:30,189 --> 00:48:31,659
assume you would just buy it.

1161
00:48:31,669 --> 00:48:33,929
I mean, because it, well, here's the question,

1162
00:48:33,939 --> 00:48:35,590
is that like a core competency or something?

1163
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,810
He just outsources now

1164
00:48:36,989 --> 00:48:39,870
and I feel like it probably used to be a core competency but due to cost cutting,

1165
00:48:39,879 --> 00:48:40,909
he probably outsourced it

1166
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:42,689
cost cutting of what,

1167
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,750
where does he need to cut costs? He's already the richest person in the world.

1168
00:48:46,889 --> 00:48:48,389
-- He be richer
-- if he cuts costs.

1169
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,959
Keep up with me here.

1170
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,689
Ok. You, ok. That's fair. That's fair. All right.

1171
00:48:54,699 --> 00:48:56,729
So, so I guess if he's outsourced it,

1172
00:48:56,739 --> 00:49:00,280
at least he doesn't have to be directly worried about GDPR.

1173
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:00,689
Right.

1174
00:49:00,699 --> 00:49:00,860
Well,

1175
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:02,149
and I would also assume that like the

1176
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:04,219
kids writing letters and the parents writing letters,

1177
00:49:04,229 --> 00:49:04,610
you know,

1178
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:06,669
um, there's again,

1179
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:07,550
you know,

1180
00:49:07,909 --> 00:49:10,290
when he replies to you, is that like a ya

1181
00:49:10,439 --> 00:49:12,510
acceptance? Like is there fine print on that letter?

1182
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:15,550
Oh, here's a great thing, Canada just passed some new cell phone laws.

1183
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:20,239
Uh, and one of the laws requires and I'm not making this up,

1184
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:22,750
it requires the contract to be readable

1185
00:49:23,229 --> 00:49:24,959
in that they can't use a font so small that

1186
00:49:24,969 --> 00:49:27,360
you can't read it because apparently that's a thing now

1187
00:49:28,209 --> 00:49:31,590
-- that, ok, uh, can it, can it be a phone book
-- though?

1188
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:33,530
It can be a phone book but it has to be reading?

1189
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:35,350
Ok.

1190
00:49:35,959 --> 00:49:38,159
Ok. I mean, that seems like I

1191
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:38,370
was

1192
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:42,110
like, you know, you could put a micro dot On the reply saying, you know,

1193
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:45,020
by reading this letter, you accept the following terms, blah, blah, blah, blah,

1194
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:45,229
blah.

1195
00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:45,590
Right?

1196
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:48,639
I would be surprised if at least in the US,

1197
00:49:48,649 --> 00:49:53,110
if that would be legal because I know I've heard of court cases before where

1198
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:55,459
something was written in a manner that was

1199
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,320
essentially illegible and the courts threw it out because

1200
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:01,260
they said even if you printed it with intent,

1201
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:02,570
it's illegible.

1202
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:06,199
So you can't possibly expect the other person to accept that.

1203
00:50:06,209 --> 00:50:09,699
Well, here's one question is how would you ever put Santa on trial?

1204
00:50:09,709 --> 00:50:13,399
-- Because basically everybody would have to recuse themselves.
-- That is true.

1205
00:50:13,409 --> 00:50:15,060
However, there are,

1206
00:50:15,949 --> 00:50:20,179
there are ways to try a person without a jury.

1207
00:50:20,729 --> 00:50:22,290
-- What
-- is here? Oh, no, I'm not.

1208
00:50:22,449 --> 00:50:24,620
But wouldn't the judge also have to recuse himself because

1209
00:50:24,629 --> 00:50:26,250
he's not going to get any more gifts from Santa

1210
00:50:27,449 --> 00:50:31,120
assuming he's not on the naughty list and never gets gifts from Santa.

1211
00:50:31,129 --> 00:50:32,870
Although then I guess you're on the naughty list.

1212
00:50:33,149 --> 00:50:33,169
You

1213
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:33,899
want to render

1214
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:34,040
a

1215
00:50:34,149 --> 00:50:36,709
not guilty verdict to get on the, the good list.

1216
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:38,600
Would you though? I don't know.

1217
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,239
Maybe letting him off is naughty. Anyway. Anyway. All right.

1218
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:47,000
Uh, let's keep going because we're gonna be here all night.

1219
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:47,830
Uh,

1220
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:50,320
labor and employment offenses.

1221
00:50:50,459 --> 00:50:51,199
We've all seen

1222
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:52,070
Futurama. Right.

1223
00:50:52,929 --> 00:50:53,649
Yes,

1224
00:50:53,949 --> 00:50:58,860
that's, that's the one I always think about is the Neptunian who are enslaved to.

1225
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:00,679
Well, they're not making toys

1226
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,189
anymore because now in Futurama, Santa only tries to kill people.

1227
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:05,830
But when Bender becomes Santa,

1228
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,419
they start the factory up again.

1229
00:51:07,429 --> 00:51:10,020
That ironically creates global warming which melts the ice.

1230
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:11,989
Santa is frozen in and then he gets out. But

1231
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:14,110
that, that's another story. Uh

1232
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,780
No, I don't know. And that's kind of the question is,

1233
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:23,409
are the elves at Saints workshop there by choice or are they indentured servants?

1234
00:51:23,419 --> 00:51:24,300
Well,

1235
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:28,489
do elves fall under human law or are they like classed as an animal

1236
00:51:28,689 --> 00:51:32,050
in which case, like have at it? Just pack them 60,000 in a barn and

1237
00:51:32,379 --> 00:51:33,989
make them make toys like chickens make?

1238
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:39,389
I would expect an elf to have a what? What is the status they trying to get monkeys?

1239
00:51:39,399 --> 00:51:41,050
A nonhuman person?

1240
00:51:41,159 --> 00:51:43,610
I think it's what they're calling it the animal rights people.

1241
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:45,729
But I, I think you could easily make an argument

1242
00:51:46,449 --> 00:51:48,360
assuming elves can speak

1243
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:53,889
and are conscious that they are nonhuman persons that deserve most of

1244
00:51:53,899 --> 00:51:57,600
the same rights and privileges a a person would have a human.

1245
00:51:57,610 --> 00:52:01,030
So, so then it kind of begs the question. Are they there on purpose?

1246
00:52:01,439 --> 00:52:05,229
And I feel like they must be because you would expect

1247
00:52:05,239 --> 00:52:07,560
in all of the years of all of the Santa,

1248
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:10,919
everything that at least one elf would want to leave.

1249
00:52:11,159 --> 00:52:11,840
Uh,

1250
00:52:12,209 --> 00:52:15,500
yeah. Yeah. I mean, even the glorious people's, what is it?

1251
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:15,750
Uh,

1252
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,129
the glorious People's Republic of North Korea has

1253
00:52:18,149 --> 00:52:19,750
people who want out for some reason.

1254
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:21,600
Yes,

1255
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:22,919
that's correct.

1256
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:25,129
Yeah, I, I think, I don't know,

1257
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:26,350
I would say however,

1258
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,070
I would point out that there has never been

1259
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:31,199
industrial action like a strike that has affected Christmas.

1260
00:52:31,709 --> 00:52:32,290
So we

1261
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:34,239
logically pause it from that.

1262
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:37,889
But since they've never gone on strike either, they're so terrified and, you know,

1263
00:52:37,899 --> 00:52:41,090
beaten that they're, they're well behaved or they're so happy,

1264
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:41,760
they're well behaved.

1265
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:43,989
So it's basically what I'm saying is, it's either one extreme.

1266
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:44,590
There's no one in that.

1267
00:52:44,729 --> 00:52:48,439
No, I don't, I don't buy the happy argument because I think

1268
00:52:48,629 --> 00:52:49,649
even if

1269
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:52,560
you can never have 100% happiness,

1270
00:52:52,739 --> 00:52:56,550
right? Some, somebody will want to leave eventually

1271
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:58,370
a basket full of puppies.

1272
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:00,399
I have not,

1273
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:01,850
that's 100% happiness.

1274
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:03,439
But, but they, they make toys,

1275
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:07,989
they make toys for spoiled Children. Like that's not going to have 100% happiness.

1276
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,520
Right? Like, let's face it. Right.

1277
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:13,360
And, and it's clear that given, given the sample size, I've seen that,

1278
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:16,449
that Santa's heuristics for determining naughty and I are

1279
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:19,320
terrible and there's basically nobody on the naughty list,

1280
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:19,719
right?

1281
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:20,919
Like let's face it,

1282
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:23,770
there are no naughty Children

1283
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,010
at Christmas

1284
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,129
and there should be, but there aren't.

1285
00:53:27,419 --> 00:53:28,639
So anyway, anyway,

1286
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:29,649
uh,

1287
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:33,560
so this actually ties in nicely with, with what's number six on the list of,

1288
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:37,219
uh, it says intentional infliction of emotional distress.

1289
00:53:37,229 --> 00:53:40,530
Uh ie naughty Children who don't get the nice things

1290
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:42,409
because they're apparently distraught over

1291
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:43,870
misbehaving and not getting presents.

1292
00:53:43,879 --> 00:53:44,239
But

1293
00:53:44,669 --> 00:53:45,969
as as I just mentioned,

1294
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:47,689
I would say the,

1295
00:53:47,699 --> 00:53:53,330
the naughtiest Children I know tend to get the most Christmas presents of anybody.

1296
00:53:53,889 --> 00:53:54,649
So

1297
00:53:54,889 --> 00:53:56,770
we're going to call BS on that one.

1298
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:59,739
I think there's the veiled threat of no presents but

1299
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:02,840
any reasonably intelligent child knows that's a load of crap

1300
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:05,020
and they're going to get stuff no matter what.

1301
00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:06,449
That's basically true.

1302
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:07,889
Yes.

1303
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:12,939
Exactly. Exactly. Uh, what about antitrust violations?

1304
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:19,409
-- Santa does kind of have a bit of a trust.
-- Well, he definitely, he's guilty of dumping,

1305
00:54:19,909 --> 00:54:20,620
like, straight up

1306
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:21,219
guilty,

1307
00:54:21,399 --> 00:54:23,429
dumping of giving the stuff away below cost.

1308
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:25,590
It's true.

1309
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:26,209
I mean, that's,

1310
00:54:27,909 --> 00:54:28,939
that's a classic

1311
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:31,800
-- monopolistic behavior. Right.
-- Right. That's right.

1312
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:36,830
And so he's ruined his competition who does, who Santa's competition to

1313
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:37,310
us?

1314
00:54:37,479 --> 00:54:37,550
Amazon

1315
00:54:37,889 --> 00:54:38,919
and they're going bankrupt

1316
00:54:39,919 --> 00:54:39,939
to

1317
00:54:41,129 --> 00:54:41,330
connect

1318
00:54:41,659 --> 00:54:41,679
the,

1319
00:54:42,649 --> 00:54:43,520
it's all there.

1320
00:54:46,139 --> 00:54:49,689
Ok. That's fair. And then tax evasion, which I guess

1321
00:54:50,149 --> 00:54:51,780
assumes he makes money.

1322
00:54:51,939 --> 00:54:53,840
Maybe he pulls like, uh,

1323
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:57,449
your Hollywood movie style accounting where he actually loses money

1324
00:54:57,459 --> 00:55:00,429
every Christmas because he's selling his product below cost.

1325
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,610
Well, but there's also the tax implications for the people receiving the gifts.

1326
00:55:03,919 --> 00:55:04,800
-- Uh
-- That's true.

1327
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:08,080
Actually, how many people are claiming taxes on their Christmas gifts?

1328
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:11,040
I bet nobody is and I bet a lot of people should be.

1329
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:12,889
That's fair. So, so

1330
00:55:13,169 --> 00:55:16,790
Santa is creating a bunch of tax criminals.

1331
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:17,050
Well,

1332
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:18,510
he's definitely creating a bunch of tax

1333
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,810
obligations that people should be dealing with.

1334
00:55:20,919 --> 00:55:21,550
Right.

1335
00:55:21,729 --> 00:55:26,260
I think with the trillions of free product he's pushing every year

1336
00:55:26,439 --> 00:55:27,679
that there'd be a,

1337
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:30,959
-- uh, more taxes paid
-- well and also import

1338
00:55:30,969 --> 00:55:33,739
tariffs. I assume he doesn't pay them.

1339
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:34,000
Right.

1340
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:38,780
My, my assumption is in terms of dealing with customs and immigration,

1341
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:42,580
he's just essentially an illegal immigrant for a short period

1342
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:45,129
of time every year in every country on the planet

1343
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,810
where he imports

1344
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,020
way above the, the limit

1345
00:55:50,199 --> 00:55:56,239
of, you know, nontaxable goods and then he leaves them in country where they are not,

1346
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:59,179
the, the taxes are not paid by the vast majority of recipients.

1347
00:55:59,189 --> 00:55:59,750
This is,

1348
00:56:00,139 --> 00:56:03,439
you know, you know, what's really funny is, is if this was actually happening.

1349
00:56:03,449 --> 00:56:05,340
Yeah, the governments would get this guy. Right.

1350
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:06,939
Because of that reason right there.

1351
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:08,739
Taxes,

1352
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:14,969
uh, oh, bringing goods into Canada, uh, gifts worth Canadian $60 or less each.

1353
00:56:14,979 --> 00:56:16,100
And weirdly enough.

1354
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:20,699
Silverware and antiques and jewelry and clothes, linens, books, furniture,

1355
00:56:20,719 --> 00:56:23,540
hobby tools and other hobby items, private collections of coin,

1356
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:25,929
stamp and art appliances such as over refrigerator.

1357
00:56:26,239 --> 00:56:31,429
-- So, honestly, it looks kind of like he's legal in Canada.
-- Well, good job, Santa

1358
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:34,750
well done. He does live very close to Canada.

1359
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:37,040
Does Canada own

1360
00:56:37,169 --> 00:56:38,090
the North Pole,

1361
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:41,169
like, like does the land extend all the way

1362
00:56:42,449 --> 00:56:44,929
-- he does?
-- And the under international?

1363
00:56:45,149 --> 00:56:47,810
Well, and that's kind of a sticking point between us and Russia.

1364
00:56:48,679 --> 00:56:49,260
Uh,

1365
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,500
they would like to own it because of the, um,

1366
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:53,629
uh,

1367
00:56:54,590 --> 00:56:57,229
yeah, basically the oil. Um, but yeah, under

1368
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:01,399
territorial claim of the Arctic, I'm pretty sure we own it. I know Denmark

1369
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:04,070
and Norway have some bogus claims as well.

1370
00:57:05,239 --> 00:57:08,429
-- Claims. But you're not, you're not biased.
-- No, not at all.

1371
00:57:08,439 --> 00:57:11,149
Well, I mean, they're danish, it's, they, they don't know any better.

1372
00:57:11,689 --> 00:57:12,449
Um,

1373
00:57:13,439 --> 00:57:15,850
but, uh, yeah, their claim fell through

1374
00:57:15,959 --> 00:57:19,459
and, uh, anyways, yeah, I'm pretty sure we should own it.

1375
00:57:19,929 --> 00:57:25,340
-- I think
-- that so, so theoretically, Santa isn't importing anything into Canada,

1376
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:29,500
-- right.
-- But does he, I thought he existed in an extra dimensional space?

1377
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:30,760
-- I
-- don't
-- know. I hope he

1378
00:57:30,929 --> 00:57:31,070
does. I

1379
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,500
mean, the North pole is melting.

1380
00:57:32,669 --> 00:57:34,939
It is. It's true. He's going to have to live on

1381
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:35,090
a,

1382
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:37,100
yeah, I was gonna say, I hope his stuff floats.

1383
00:57:37,229 --> 00:57:39,659
It's going to change a lot of Christmas movies, isn't it?

1384
00:57:39,669 --> 00:57:43,209
Where, where now from going to the north pole on a sheet of ice?

1385
00:57:43,219 --> 00:57:46,610
You'll have people traveling there by boat to look

1386
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:48,570
at what a pole sticking out of the water.

1387
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:50,350
I don't, I don't know how that's gonna work.

1388
00:57:50,449 --> 00:57:53,370
-- Uh
-- Yeah, you can just drop a boy tether it to the bottom of the ocean.

1389
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:54,219
How deep

1390
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:56,389
-- it is there.
-- I bet it's

1391
00:57:56,409 --> 00:57:56,870
deep.

1392
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:57,139
Yeah,

1393
00:57:57,909 --> 00:57:58,479
because there's also a

1394
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:00,459
problem where, like the north pole doesn't move,

1395
00:58:00,469 --> 00:58:02,370
but the magnetic north pole wanders around.

1396
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:04,169
It does. Yes.

1397
00:58:04,739 --> 00:58:05,409
And it's,

1398
00:58:05,419 --> 00:58:08,649
it's moving rather quickly these days if I recall

1399
00:58:08,659 --> 00:58:11,300
correctly where they're expecting it to flip over in,

1400
00:58:11,310 --> 00:58:12,689
like the next 1000 years

1401
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:14,610
north will be south and south will be north.

1402
00:58:14,739 --> 00:58:15,889
That's going to be a problem.

1403
00:58:17,129 --> 00:58:17,669
Well,

1404
00:58:18,169 --> 00:58:21,030
maybe, I mean, it's going to happen slow. Right.

1405
00:58:21,189 --> 00:58:24,149
So my assumption is any sort of technology

1406
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:25,840
that's not what the movie show.

1407
00:58:26,129 --> 00:58:26,750
Oh. Right.

1408
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,360
Where the, well, well, there was also the movie where,

1409
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:32,729
what the earth's core stopped spinning and they had

1410
00:58:32,739 --> 00:58:35,229
to shoot a rocket into the sun or something.

1411
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:36,919
I have to restart it.

1412
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:38,469
I know I'm being silly

1413
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,270
but it's, they're all dumb. Right. It's,

1414
00:58:42,149 --> 00:58:42,639
are they,

1415
00:58:43,379 --> 00:58:43,939
I don't know,

1416
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:45,209
there was some compelling

1417
00:58:45,639 --> 00:58:46,080
arguments.

1418
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:47,669
Uh, anyway.

1419
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:48,729
Right.

1420
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:51,949
We're, we're out of stories and we're probably out of time.

1421
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:52,989
But it's,

1422
00:58:53,419 --> 00:58:56,729
yeah. So I guess the, the moral of the story is

1423
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:59,949
you have to be afraid of Santa. Right? There's something up with that dude.

1424
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:02,590
Uh Yeah. No, there's clearly something ain't. Right.

1425
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:07,219
-- Right. Beware Santas bearing gifts,
-- right. Yes. Is there another kind of Santa?

1426
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:08,260
Well, I guess if you're naughty.

1427
00:59:08,399 --> 00:59:10,010
Well, it, every, that,

1428
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:13,780
that's true because don't the Germans have the guy Rupert or what's his name?

1429
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:15,649
-- Um, oh,
-- are you thinking of, um,

1430
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:16,770
the

1431
00:59:17,139 --> 00:59:19,560
-- cus,
-- the guy who helps. What Crump is it Crump?

1432
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:21,219
He's got a weird name.

1433
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:21,699
Claus.

1434
00:59:23,139 --> 00:59:23,750
There's

1435
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:26,360
center clause is just the Dutch. Santa isn't.

1436
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:28,000
Actually

1437
00:59:28,169 --> 00:59:32,959
David Sedaris has a really funny story about that where I guess in, in, in Holland,

1438
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:34,090
Santa is

1439
00:59:34,459 --> 00:59:36,719
accompanied by, like, 3 to 6

1440
00:59:36,949 --> 00:59:38,790
black men. It's,

1441
00:59:39,129 --> 00:59:43,000
I love how every culture has its own, like crazy Santa myth

1442
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:45,919
and, and it's always just bizarre.

1443
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:47,040
I love it.

1444
00:59:47,659 --> 00:59:49,000
It's fun. It's fun.

1445
00:59:49,659 --> 00:59:50,520
Oh, man.

1446
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,409
All right. So anyway, any, any last thoughts, Kurt?

1447
00:59:53,419 --> 00:59:55,000
-- Well,
-- maybe leave something up for Krampus.

1448
00:59:55,010 --> 01:00:00,189
-- He looks like a fun guy
-- uh or leave beer out for Santa kids. If you're listening,

1449
01:00:00,290 --> 01:00:01,850
leave beer out for Santa, but don't

1450
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:04,040
open it. He will. Thank you later. Yes, that's true.

1451
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:06,239
You can't open the beer and preferably keep it on ice

1452
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:08,360
that way. It's nice and cold when he gets there.

1453
01:00:08,889 --> 01:00:10,639
Uh Santa will thank you later.

1454
01:00:11,879 --> 01:00:15,469
All right. All right. Thanks, Kurt. Thank you everybody for listening.

1455
01:00:15,479 --> 01:00:16,449
