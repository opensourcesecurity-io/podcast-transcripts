Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,399
Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime, Josh Pressers

2
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:16,530
-- and I miss that crime.
-- I, I think it's time for us to embrace real,

3
00:00:16,639 --> 00:00:19,459
probably white collar crime. I feel like that's more our thing.

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,360
-- I don't think you and I would do very well at real crime.
-- Although

5
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:29,000
now I think you are implicating yourself where if I do legitimately commit crime,

6
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:29,879
then

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,259
there is going to be countless hours of evidence of you claiming

8
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,340
-- to be my associate in said crimes
-- or it's a double bluff.

9
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:38,389
Kurt's

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:38,930
who would,

11
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:43,869
who would be exactly five D just who would be stupid enough to claim this in advance?

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,080
Have you read

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,939
any police report ever?

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,020
Oh, my God. I love

15
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,509
honestly, my favorite isn't police reports.

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,189
It's watching the border shows where these people come to the

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,020
border and basically they try lying to the border agent.

18
00:00:58,029 --> 00:00:58,439
And, you know,

19
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,659
it always reminds me of is car salesman where the car salesman sells a car,

20
00:01:01,669 --> 00:01:04,150
like three times a day and people coming in to buy a car, buy a car,

21
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,139
like once every five years, you're going to lose.

22
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:06,400
Right.

23
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:10,180
The border agent has seen and heard your story and every single variation of it

24
00:01:10,449 --> 00:01:12,169
seven times this week already.

25
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,790
Yeah. Exactly. And I love when the stories get real complicated though.

26
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,830
This one guy who's coming to America, but he's not visiting family,

27
00:01:18,839 --> 00:01:22,750
but the guy is his father in law or his godfather, but it's not his godfather.

28
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,050
They're going to be adopting him,

29
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,410
but he's not their son yet and they're not adopted yet

30
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,029
and he's going to be staying with them for three months,

31
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,580
but he's not going to be working and he doesn't have a lot of

32
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,900
money and it's going to be fine because he's also going to travel.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,669
And of course, you know, the agent's just like, yeah,

34
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,110
his story doesn't really hold together, right?

35
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,389
And I feel bad for the guy but

36
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,730
-- like, oh man, just some of these people, you know,
-- my,

37
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:46,309
my favorite example of that is I have a friend who is a police officer and he said

38
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:48,459
when you pull someone over and ask if they've

39
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,239
been drinking and they say they've had two.

40
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,239
-- It's always
-- two beers. It's two.

41
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,839
-- You know, anyone who says two needs to be out of the car.
-- I kept a count.

42
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:57,970
I was watching, we were watching,

43
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,459
you're under arrest and cops and a couple others and I kept a tally

44
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:06,410
and it was literally always two beers with the one exception of one guy said one beer,

45
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,410
several people of course, said I haven't been drinking at all. And the cops, like,

46
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,789
but that I can smell it on your breath,

47
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,470
right. You know,

48
00:02:13,649 --> 00:02:15,639
and then of course there was the one guy who's like, yeah,

49
00:02:15,649 --> 00:02:17,350
I've been drinking all day and the cops, like, what?

50
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,529
And the guy was honest with the cop and the cops, like,

51
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:23,289
I'm still gonna have to bring you in for driving under the influence.

52
00:02:23,369 --> 00:02:24,850
I was like, thank you for being honest.

53
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,199
So, you know, funny enough,

54
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:31,300
this ties into the discussion we want to have today of the fact that there are

55
00:02:31,449 --> 00:02:33,699
when you do something only every now and then

56
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,460
it feels different.

57
00:02:35,779 --> 00:02:38,860
And I think even worse, this ties into the law of large numbers because there's like,

58
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:40,889
doing something once a week or once a day.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,289
But when you do something

60
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:47,220
seven times a day and you practice and get good at it and optimize it. Like,

61
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,259
I once actually arranged with a butcher to go butcher chickens with him.

62
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,020
And unfortunately the deal fell through.

63
00:02:53,029 --> 00:02:54,720
But because I wanted to learn how to properly butcher

64
00:02:54,729 --> 00:02:56,339
a chicken and the reality is to do that,

65
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:59,059
I'm gonna have to carve up like a couple of 100 chickens.

66
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:01,009
I, I can't afford to do that at home

67
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:03,770
or eat chicken every day for the, you know, next few years.

68
00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:04,940
Right.

69
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:07,619
I mean, I love chicken but, you know, a little variety but, you know,

70
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,169
that's the point.

71
00:03:08,179 --> 00:03:10,619
Right. Like this guy, you know, the butcher shop I go to,

72
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,380
they can carve meat better than I ever will because they do it for eight hours a day.

73
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,399
-- Right. Right. It's like any
-- skill. Like, it's a family butcher shop. Right.

74
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,860
They've all been doing it since they were 16.

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,059
-- Yeah,
-- exactly. Man.

76
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,399
Exactly. And same thing with, like, security stuff. Right.

77
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,699
You and me. How many vulnerabilities have we read?

78
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:28,910
-- More than 10,000?
-- How many, how many today?

79
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:29,410
Yeah.

80
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:33,669
You know, I once did the math and I at the two companies I worked previous to Red Hat,

81
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:37,250
I think I handle something like 30,000 vulnerabilities

82
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:42,070
-- over a period of like seven or eight years.
-- I believe that once you spread it out,

83
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,130
what's a couple a day?

84
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:43,889
Yeah.

85
00:03:44,029 --> 00:03:47,330
Anyway, anyway, OK. So let's explain.

86
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:51,330
There are two news stories that kind of piqued our interest

87
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,009
and

88
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,889
I will let you explain them.

89
00:03:53,899 --> 00:03:54,750
-- How about,
-- well,

90
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:58,440
so the first one is the ever classic targeting developers

91
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:02,399
with your sort of not quite mission impossible style attacks,

92
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:07,240
but more like a spearfishing a developer so that you can like inject some code

93
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:10,470
either into the repo directly or the more likely scenario.

94
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,880
A dependency of a dependency of a dependency.

95
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:14,520
You know, you go down the chain and you get that,

96
00:04:14,529 --> 00:04:17,358
that famous XKCD comic from a few weeks ago where you know,

97
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:20,220
the whole internet rests on like some random library written

98
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,065
by a guy in Arkansas in his spare time.

99
00:04:22,704 --> 00:04:24,945
Like, I remember working a XML hash do

100
00:04:25,105 --> 00:04:26,364
bug. And the guy

101
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:30,584
was, like, I have a free weekend in, like, five weeks to fix this.

102
00:04:30,595 --> 00:04:32,184
I can't do it before then. I'm busy.

103
00:04:32,195 --> 00:04:34,804
I have a life, I have kids and we're like, ok, we,

104
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:37,904
we're actually going to do it for you because we need this sooner than in five weeks.

105
00:04:37,915 --> 00:04:39,535
There's a ton of these things, you know, there, well,

106
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:42,545
there's infamous cases where people have essentially

107
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:43,984
hijacked

108
00:04:44,334 --> 00:04:48,345
libraries online using either, you know, social engineering or just outright,

109
00:04:48,609 --> 00:04:51,750
you know, some sort of process to, to hijack it, you know,

110
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,709
account retrieval type deal and then, you know,

111
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:59,029
inject like a a what was it Cryptocurrency, wallet theft software, blah, blah,

112
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,309
blah.

113
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,589
-- I,
-- I want to set the table here and I don't think

114
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,589
worrying about this, like if this keeps you up at night,

115
00:05:08,179 --> 00:05:12,880
you have very broken priorities is how I would describe this.

116
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:15,959
Yes and no, there's a few people who do need to worry about it,

117
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,290
but there's a really easy solution.

118
00:05:18,299 --> 00:05:20,079
And I know, for example, Google did this where

119
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,829
Google has a bunch of software.

120
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,600
They open source software that they really,

121
00:05:23,609 --> 00:05:25,929
really rely upon in various ecosystems.

122
00:05:26,049 --> 00:05:29,260
And so they just pull a copy of all of it into their own servers,

123
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:31,679
like their own source code servers and manage

124
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,959
it themselves and they manage what comes in.

125
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:36,959
And so to put it bluntly, they've reinvented Red Hat.

126
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,290
Right. And, and

127
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,359
-- not everyone can do that.
-- Yeah.

128
00:05:41,369 --> 00:05:42,989
And that's not bad either because Google's like, well,

129
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,839
we need the software to do XY and Z, we don't need the latest hotness.

130
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,630
We just need it to work reliably and have all the security patches.

131
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:51,839
And Google is at a scale where they can do that, you know?

132
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,470
Ok, we're gonna have 10 or 50 people do this. Cool. Like who signs the check?

133
00:05:55,625 --> 00:06:00,445
Let's explain the second half of this story, which is the the other

134
00:06:00,644 --> 00:06:01,565
news story.

135
00:06:01,575 --> 00:06:04,964
And ironically, they're both from the register which like was not on purpose,

136
00:06:04,975 --> 00:06:05,825
but I love it.

137
00:06:06,174 --> 00:06:09,285
Well, they are a good news source. The reality is I would say,

138
00:06:09,825 --> 00:06:11,584
and I'm just making up numbers here

139
00:06:11,714 --> 00:06:13,285
probably between half

140
00:06:13,584 --> 00:06:16,265
and 80 to 90% of all security flaws.

141
00:06:16,274 --> 00:06:19,024
And I, when I say security flaws, I mean, not like the big important ones.

142
00:06:19,035 --> 00:06:21,345
I mean, like all security flaws

143
00:06:21,454 --> 00:06:23,244
basically

144
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:25,125
can either be handled publicly

145
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,910
and are or accidentally sort of

146
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,029
become public because, you know,

147
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:35,700
literally a developer commits the code patch before the issue is public, but it's,

148
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:39,529
you know, looks innocuous and it's nobody pays attention to it or in some cases,

149
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,899
I've seen them commit a code patch that literally says like fixed buffer overflow,

150
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,100
you know, a week before the official thing goes out.

151
00:06:45,109 --> 00:06:46,309
And quite frankly, like

152
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,309
it really doesn't matter that much. It's

153
00:06:48,429 --> 00:06:49,470
Attackers

154
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,609
in theory,

155
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,559
they could be monitoring this and use this as a

156
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:55,279
supply of security flaws that haven't been patched yet.

157
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,359
But generally speaking,

158
00:06:56,369 --> 00:06:59,730
most Attackers are using security flaws that are well known for months.

159
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,440
Right.

160
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,799
Right. Right. Ok. So the second half of this, which your description

161
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:10,679
I feel like is more vague than I like. So I'm going to, I'm going to fix it, right.

162
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:11,350
I'll patch it.

163
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:14,179
So, back in the day, millions of years ago,

164
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:15,690
there was

165
00:07:15,989 --> 00:07:20,609
the concept of a security embargo where a project, for example,

166
00:07:20,619 --> 00:07:23,549
would have a patch ready to go when something went public,

167
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:27,130
the patch got committed into the public repo and everyone was happy

168
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:30,380
these days. Everyone's using github, github. Basically.

169
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,290
I don't think they have private issues still.

170
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:32,880
They do not.

171
00:07:33,135 --> 00:07:35,744
-- Yeah. Remember they added it, we talked to the guy.
-- Oh, that's right. That's right.

172
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,035
Ok. That's right. That's right.

173
00:07:37,045 --> 00:07:39,825
That's for, well, it's different though because that's for security things.

174
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:40,375
It's, yeah.

175
00:07:40,385 --> 00:07:43,665
And, and to be fair, like, that's relatively in the last 12 months or less.

176
00:07:43,674 --> 00:07:46,665
And for, especially for me and Josh, that it breaks our worldview a bit.

177
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:47,464
But in a good way,

178
00:07:47,595 --> 00:07:51,184
-- this
-- is what month, 37 of this year. So

179
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:52,339
anyway, anyway,

180
00:07:52,549 --> 00:07:53,670
so basically,

181
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:56,980
what happened is these researchers realized you could basically mine

182
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,190
github

183
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,059
-- and, and get like, the Linux kernel is their example. That
-- used to be my job.

184
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:07,500
Like when I worked for very security firms, when everyone knew it.

185
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,130
Like literally, when we worked for very security.

186
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,190
Uh when I worked for various security firms, at least, you know,

187
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,980
we would monitor all the public sources.

188
00:08:14,989 --> 00:08:18,179
We basically had a thing that sucked in change logs and looked for the word

189
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,299
security in other terms.

190
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:21,140
And we were starting to look at, you know,

191
00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:24,179
like actually looking at commit streams and

192
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:25,760
there's certain projects that when a certain

193
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:28,859
person commits a code that's a security fix nine times out of 10.

194
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:30,339
And my favorite always, for example,

195
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,679
is like internet software consortium did this all the time where they

196
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,820
do a bind or a DH P release with a security fix,

197
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,650
but they don't clearly label which part of the code it

198
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:39,260
was and they would do a bunch of other fixes.

199
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,500
So you'd end up with like a one or 200 kilobyte patch file.

200
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,940
And on average, it took me something like five minutes

201
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,500
to find the security patch.

202
00:08:47,979 --> 00:08:50,640
And like, I, I wouldn't even call myself a programmer, but, you know,

203
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,830
you learn to read patches.

204
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,900
And so like five minutes later, I'd be like, oh OK,

205
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,530
it's this function doing this thing and

206
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:57,809
you know, based on the description, it's like, yeah,

207
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:02,880
if you can force a recursive query to a server, it'll do this look up and it'll,

208
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,830
you know, eat a reply.

209
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,679
That's way too big and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Right.

210
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,789
And so, you know, I

211
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,239
was trying to obfuscate this and trying to, you know, release the patch, but without

212
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:10,940
details.

213
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,000
And yeah, like literally half an hour later,

214
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,570
I'd have written up my report and we'd have released it to customers.

215
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,719
And now the, I think the most interesting example of this is,

216
00:09:19,729 --> 00:09:23,239
I think it might have been meltdown or one of those CPU type bugs

217
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,880
where the patches went into the Linux kernel like months before it was known.

218
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,599
See, here's the thing. Now we start talking about culture

219
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:36,140
and world view. So there's people that view the world

220
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:38,510
in security terms of, you know,

221
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:43,039
security is special and it needs to be handled differently and embargo and blah,

222
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,559
-- blah, blah, blah,
-- we are not those people.

223
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,940
Well,

224
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,049
I would say part of me still is because I

225
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:51,280
can see that there are corner cases where that's suitable,

226
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:54,960
but they are very, very limited, like three times a year limited

227
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:56,340
across the globe.

228
00:09:56,349 --> 00:09:58,380
But then there's the more sort of and,

229
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,679
and that camp also speaks to sort of the red

230
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,979
hat style of corporate and industrial software user where it's like

231
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,630
I want to install software on this thing and make this thing work,

232
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,700
but like basically never have to run the risk of doing

233
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:11,830
something to it that breaks it because it's an oil refinery,

234
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,900
you know, and you don't want to break those things, they're expensive.

235
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:15,820
And then there's the second camp which is

236
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:18,479
more developer driven and focused where they're like,

237
00:10:18,489 --> 00:10:19,630
just run the latest greatest,

238
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:23,010
which, you know, if you're running something on your laptop and playing games,

239
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,710
cool.

240
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:25,969
You know, if it, if it breaks you just fix it.

241
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:27,989
And so a great example of that camp would be like the

242
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,940
open BS D group or project story and the Linux kernel group,

243
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:31,210
right?

244
00:10:31,219 --> 00:10:33,650
The Linux kernel group is like, security isn't special.

245
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:38,169
They're just bugs, we fix them, we move on, you run current or else, Well, you don't

246
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:42,179
-- too bad for you. Well,
-- you pay someone to, to care and feed it.

247
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,479
I mean, this is kind of, that was Red Hat's whole thing basically.

248
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,380
And there's people that want that. I mean, we do this all the time in life.

249
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:52,690
-- It took me like 20 years to accept Peck's plumbing. What
-- that stuff's awesome, man.

250
00:10:52,859 --> 00:10:55,969
Well, now that I've used it, yeah, I would agree because basically it, oh,

251
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,979
so I just cut the pipe, jam, a shark bite, fitting on it.

252
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,729
And I just basically play like, you know,

253
00:11:00,739 --> 00:11:03,340
keep your toys with my plumbing and just jam them together.

254
00:11:03,349 --> 00:11:06,409
Oh, well, like, and I don't have to like solder upside down.

255
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:06,969
Oh,

256
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,530
yeah. No, this is a no brainer.

257
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,659
Well, and, and so actually what, what got me into pecs

258
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,250
is so

259
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:14,929
back in

260
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:20,260
man, this would have been like, 06 or eight ish give or take.

261
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,869
The cost of copper had become

262
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,780
obscenely expensive.

263
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:28,380
And now Peck was relatively new in the area. I was in

264
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:33,440
and buying a crimper. I remember the crimper was, like, $300 back when I bought it.

265
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,570
But the thing is I did all the math and the

266
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,530
cost of the copper for the project I was working on

267
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:44,219
was going to be about $600. Whereas the crimper, plus the, the crimper was 300

268
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:47,000
like, everything else I needed was maybe 20 bucks.

269
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:48,359
Well, that's what gets me.

270
00:11:48,369 --> 00:11:51,159
Yeah, the crimper is still like, yeah, 100 bucks it'll last forever.

271
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,630
As long as you don't like soak it in salt water

272
00:11:54,432 --> 00:11:58,601
is like, so rusted now because it's so old, but it's still fine. It doesn't matter.

273
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,021
But anyway, anyway,

274
00:12:00,031 --> 00:12:05,161
the point is it was one of those situations where I could buy $600 worth of copper

275
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:06,002
and the time,

276
00:12:06,252 --> 00:12:08,671
-- the time of like, soldering a joint.
-- Yes,

277
00:12:08,971 --> 00:12:10,471
I didn't understand that.

278
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:12,791
And so I sent my wife and kids away for the

279
00:12:12,802 --> 00:12:15,111
weekend while I was basically doing a bunch of plumbing,

280
00:12:15,122 --> 00:12:16,202
work on this bathroom.

281
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:17,601
We were getting remodeled

282
00:12:17,731 --> 00:12:19,601
and I was like, go away for the weekend.

283
00:12:19,814 --> 00:12:23,354
I, I, I'll hopefully be done when you get back. And anyway, my wife goes away.

284
00:12:23,403 --> 00:12:24,794
-- It took
-- about 20 minutes, right?

285
00:12:24,924 --> 00:12:26,374
It took about 20 minutes. Yes.

286
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,494
What gets me too is like, you gotta cut the pipe. You're just like,

287
00:12:30,804 --> 00:12:32,653
like, literally that's how long it takes to cut pecks.

288
00:12:33,124 --> 00:12:36,893
Whereas cutting copper properly, you got to cut it and then you got to score it out,

289
00:12:36,903 --> 00:12:37,994
you got to do the ends.

290
00:12:38,323 --> 00:12:40,244
Like, it's five or 10 minutes

291
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:41,593
-- for
-- joint,

292
00:12:41,703 --> 00:12:41,864
right?

293
00:12:42,124 --> 00:12:45,193
And it was funny because my wife calls me and says how

294
00:12:45,325 --> 00:12:46,695
plumbing going. I said, oh, I'm done.

295
00:12:46,755 --> 00:12:48,825
And this is like, you know, like noon on Saturday

296
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,495
and she says, oh, ha ha, like, really? How's it all this going?

297
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:54,505
I'm like, no, I'm completely serious. I am 100% done with this project.

298
00:12:54,515 --> 00:12:56,185
Like, you can come home whenever you want.

299
00:12:56,325 --> 00:12:59,866
Well, I have to replace both my outside water taps because they're like 40 years old.

300
00:12:59,935 --> 00:13:04,296
And if I do it with copper, it's going to take easily about 4 to 6 hours each one.

301
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:08,245
And if I do it with, you know, replacing it with packs, it's going to take about,

302
00:13:08,265 --> 00:13:09,755
you know, 15 minutes anyway.

303
00:13:09,765 --> 00:13:10,716
Anyway, we are,

304
00:13:11,176 --> 00:13:13,245
this is not a plumbing podcast.

305
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,559
Well, but the point is so, so there's, there's new and better ways

306
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,739
and so,

307
00:13:19,229 --> 00:13:23,169
yeah, not everybody can, can stay current, you know, you're,

308
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,880
you're using the Linux kernel for automotive

309
00:13:26,169 --> 00:13:27,289
software support.

310
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:30,559
Well, you can't just be like, hey, we're going to ship you a new kernel every day

311
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:31,729
and hope that it works.

312
00:13:31,739 --> 00:13:35,369
I mean, and in theory, you could, but you'd have to have a really crazy C ID build,

313
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,669
process, testing, process,

314
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:39,010
whatever and that's just not going to happen basically.

315
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,770
What it always comes down to really is people grossly

316
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,809
overestimate the value of the majority of security flaws.

317
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,130
I would agree with that

318
00:13:48,385 --> 00:13:51,846
because when you look at what security flaws are actually being used,

319
00:13:51,856 --> 00:13:52,656
it's not these ones.

320
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,046
Let's explain that statement because I bet you there

321
00:13:55,056 --> 00:13:57,575
are more than one listener who is like,

322
00:13:57,585 --> 00:13:57,806
what?

323
00:13:57,815 --> 00:14:01,536
-- Now it
-- kind of reminds me of when people start theoretically going over, like,

324
00:14:01,546 --> 00:14:04,585
for example, the use cases of drones and terrorism and people are like, oh my God,

325
00:14:04,596 --> 00:14:05,536
you shouldn't give people ideas.

326
00:14:05,546 --> 00:14:08,935
And it's like you seriously haven't had the thought of like strap a hand

327
00:14:08,945 --> 00:14:12,656
grenade to a drone and fly it somewhere and drop the hand grenade.

328
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,765
Like if you think a terrorist can't come up with

329
00:14:14,776 --> 00:14:16,995
that on their own after it's been in the news,

330
00:14:17,005 --> 00:14:17,135
like

331
00:14:17,242 --> 00:14:21,062
that's how the Russians blew up, that Ukrainian ammo dump with one hand grenade.

332
00:14:21,072 --> 00:14:24,021
-- I'm sorry. But this is not rocket science,
-- right? Ok.

333
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:27,142
So here I want to, I want to tie all this together now. Ok.

334
00:14:27,432 --> 00:14:31,481
So security people have a notorious history of

335
00:14:31,492 --> 00:14:33,661
talking about how the world is going to end

336
00:14:33,802 --> 00:14:38,231
doom and gloom and it never does, right. It just doesn't because

337
00:14:38,351 --> 00:14:43,341
-- we, we always overestimate. I
-- think we just keep rescheduling it for next Thursday.

338
00:14:43,671 --> 00:14:46,171
That's right. It, it feels like it's getting closer

339
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,739
anyway. We always overestimate the importance of this stuff.

340
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,150
But I think part of the challenge is we are

341
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:56,289
buried in these issues in ways normal people aren't.

342
00:14:56,299 --> 00:14:57,210
And So we don't,

343
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:00,539
we rarely have the big picture view even though we like to think we do.

344
00:15:00,549 --> 00:15:03,140
So there's obviously the security people are always doing this.

345
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:06,489
There is the fact that when you look at Attackers,

346
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,020
I think that the way we think

347
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:11,229
about Attackers is evolving substantially where historically,

348
00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:11,940
I think it was just

349
00:15:12,052 --> 00:15:15,513
a lot of pranks. Right. It was like kids with too much free time.

350
00:15:15,523 --> 00:15:19,432
-- Well, there wasn't
-- really, it was really hard to monetize a lot of these attacks.

351
00:15:19,442 --> 00:15:20,552
Yes, exactly.

352
00:15:20,732 --> 00:15:23,062
-- That
-- has changed. Oh, boy. Has it ever?

353
00:15:23,153 --> 00:15:25,103
Well, you've got, like, bug bounties now, right.

354
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:28,033
Oh, I meant more like, you know, crypto mining on people's hardware.

355
00:15:28,043 --> 00:15:30,622
Well, ok, there's, there's that angle too, but I don't like,

356
00:15:30,632 --> 00:15:32,783
so that was a really big deal for a while.

357
00:15:32,793 --> 00:15:34,953
I don't even see that. Like I used to.

358
00:15:35,023 --> 00:15:37,072
Yeah, because it's horribly inefficient and it's

359
00:15:37,226 --> 00:15:40,705
way more efficient to just steal people's crypto from their wallets.

360
00:15:40,716 --> 00:15:41,726
And so it's a vault.

361
00:15:41,846 --> 00:15:47,226
-- And
-- so here's, here's part of the story though is we are building a market where

362
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,966
you're going to make more money being a legit

363
00:15:49,976 --> 00:15:52,705
security researcher than you are being a criminal.

364
00:15:52,716 --> 00:15:56,276
Generally speaking, I look at what I earned versus what I've read.

365
00:15:56,286 --> 00:15:59,096
The Underground earns and unless we do some really crazy pons,

366
00:15:59,106 --> 00:16:02,325
there was a recent Blockchain related crypto scam

367
00:16:02,859 --> 00:16:05,479
2.5 million. And I'm like, that's it.

368
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:08,520
Like, that's all these guys manage to pull off with a Ponzi scheme.

369
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:12,150
-- That's actually not good and
-- that's not normal, right.

370
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:16,190
That's the Black Swan of the, of the, the, the scammers.

371
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,909
So, anyway,

372
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:19,690
I have no doubt that you would make way more money

373
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,729
and here's the thing like to do this kind of work,

374
00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:25,809
you gotta be smart and you're going to be smart enough to say Holy Carol, this isn't a,

375
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,479
you know, I'm gonna,

376
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:29,539
I'm gonna do way better just doing a bug bunny over here than I am trying to, you know,

377
00:16:29,549 --> 00:16:31,890
scam old people out of Bitcoin or something.

378
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:35,469
And, and so now we, we look at our environment, right?

379
00:16:35,479 --> 00:16:39,929
And you've got the state level actors who in all seriousness,

380
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:44,640
they are unstoppable because they have like the best example is there's this,

381
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,570
this blog post that's basically

382
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:47,979
when you look at the tax,

383
00:16:47,989 --> 00:16:50,710
there's Mossad and not Mossad is the way this guy breaks it down.

384
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:54,429
And like he talks about the fact that like if Mossad wants your, your stuff, they'll,

385
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,109
they'll like, you know,

386
00:16:55,119 --> 00:16:59,950
put uranium in your phone and have you die of brain cancer and then buy your estate,

387
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,789
-- you know, in 20 years or
-- even simpler.

388
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,868
Like, you know, I always tell people at the, the CS A,

389
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,640
if somebody snatches you and threatens to beat your knees in for your crypto keys,

390
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:08,260
you give them their cry,

391
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,400
your crypto keys,

392
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,430
-- your knees can't be fixed, man, especially past the age of 40
-- right?

393
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:21,089
But anyway, anyway, so, so the point is I feel like we, we try to frame security

394
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,449
in a world that doesn't exist.

395
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,560
-- And I think it is not particularly useful.
-- Has there ever been a research

396
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,890
or a study looking at actual

397
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,300
which vulnerabilities are being used,

398
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,369
are being used for what and how and what the

399
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,680
outcomes were when I looked at the crypto stuff,

400
00:17:39,689 --> 00:17:40,219
for example,

401
00:17:40,229 --> 00:17:41,790
you know what the number one attack in crypto

402
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,699
is for actually getting money phishing sim swap.

403
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,219
So I basically hijack your phone number and then

404
00:17:47,229 --> 00:17:48,839
I reset your account and I take your money.

405
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:49,170
That's it.

406
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:49,989
-- Yeah,
-- that's why don't,

407
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,420
don't use your cell phone as your second factor for your crypto account,

408
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,910
but don't use a phone number, right?

409
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,469
-- And, and that's it. It's just that
-- simple. That doesn't shock me in any way yet.

410
00:17:58,479 --> 00:17:59,150
How many,

411
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,865
how many people are taking down is the

412
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,395
most serious threat to the Cryptocurrency universe,

413
00:18:03,406 --> 00:18:03,625
right?

414
00:18:03,635 --> 00:18:04,465
Probably not many.

415
00:18:04,475 --> 00:18:04,786
Well,

416
00:18:04,796 --> 00:18:08,215
it's funny actually because some are like Coinbase now has a thing where it actually

417
00:18:08,225 --> 00:18:10,845
warns you if you choose S MS two fa it says this is moderate,

418
00:18:10,855 --> 00:18:11,676
it's ok,

419
00:18:11,745 --> 00:18:18,166
but stronger is using a software two fa and even best is a hardware two fa like a token,

420
00:18:18,196 --> 00:18:19,456
like a UB or whatever.

421
00:18:19,776 --> 00:18:20,625
And I'm like, it's nice.

422
00:18:20,765 --> 00:18:23,135
Yeah, they do a good job because I have a Coinbase account.

423
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:25,595
That's where I sold my $50 worth of Cryptocurrency.

424
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:29,381
Way back when I was looking to see, like, can I turn Bitcoin into money?

425
00:18:29,391 --> 00:18:32,822
And I did and then I paid my taxes on it and nobody audited me.

426
00:18:32,832 --> 00:18:35,562
Thank goodness, you're on a list now for, you know, 10 years from now.

427
00:18:35,651 --> 00:18:37,232
Well, no, honestly,

428
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,541
my taxes are super boring and I purposely make sure I'm

429
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,822
not like trying to mess with the system just because like,

430
00:18:41,832 --> 00:18:45,121
the cost of the audit is going to vastly outweigh like

431
00:18:45,131 --> 00:18:47,171
the 100 bucks I might scam out of the government.

432
00:18:47,182 --> 00:18:49,342
-- So I'm
-- like, well, and that's a perfect example, right?

433
00:18:49,352 --> 00:18:52,381
All these people trying to do, you know, financial scams and outside of, again,

434
00:18:52,391 --> 00:18:53,131
like good

435
00:18:53,472 --> 00:18:55,141
honest white collar crime

436
00:18:55,689 --> 00:18:59,699
when you try and scam the tax authority for money, like they're going to win

437
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,150
eventually and right,

438
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,680
because they have infinite time and how much am I actually going to get by,

439
00:19:04,689 --> 00:19:06,160
by lying about my deductions?

440
00:19:06,189 --> 00:19:07,849
100 bucks? That's not worth it.

441
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:09,859
I used to get like GST rebates because I, you know,

442
00:19:09,869 --> 00:19:11,660
primarily contract for American firms.

443
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:12,770
And so I get, you know,

444
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:16,219
between one and $2000 a year back from the government. And of course, they audited me

445
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:18,650
and it came out to within two cents of what my account said. It shouldn't.

446
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,459
They cut me a check the next week, I

447
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:25,560
guess what it boils down to most people vastly overestimate the competency.

448
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,719
And I think they also overestimate the reward

449
00:19:27,729 --> 00:19:29,189
like people seem to think robbing a bank,

450
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:29,979
you're going to get, like,

451
00:19:30,229 --> 00:19:32,430
you know, a giant bag with a million dollars.

452
00:19:32,619 --> 00:19:32,640
Oh,

453
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:33,369
no.

454
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,790
Like the average bank robbery, I think in Alberta at one point was like,

455
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,500
-- between two and $3000
-- and you can't spend any of

456
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,170
the money because it's all marked up the wazoo.

457
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:45,449
-- I mean, as soon as you spend it, they're going to
-- find

458
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:45,689
you.

459
00:19:45,699 --> 00:19:45,949
I mean,

460
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:48,849
we talked about that one where the guy actually did rob a bank and got away

461
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:52,810
on a bicycle and which I thought was kind of awesome because I never heard that.

462
00:19:53,435 --> 00:19:55,125
Yeah, but still two grand.

463
00:19:55,305 --> 00:19:55,915
Yeah, exactly.

464
00:19:55,925 --> 00:19:57,224
Well, and now there's, you know,

465
00:19:57,234 --> 00:19:59,714
that there's that security footage and all that stuff out there for.

466
00:19:59,724 --> 00:20:00,185
Right.

467
00:20:00,295 --> 00:20:02,375
Go to get a job, like,

468
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:04,564
anyway,

469
00:20:04,694 --> 00:20:08,744
ok, we've explained, we think that there's obviously

470
00:20:08,864 --> 00:20:13,194
a certain amount of, I guess, unnecessary alarm here.

471
00:20:13,204 --> 00:20:15,425
-- And so, like, let's, let's frame this.
-- It's fun.

472
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:18,520
It's way more fun than the real stuff because the real stuff is boring.

473
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,770
Yeah. Yes, I'm getting to that.

474
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:25,050
So let's frame that conversation in the context of say, watching the Linux

475
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:25,989
public G

476
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:30,609
repo for fixes that don't follow the standard procedure and saying

477
00:20:30,619 --> 00:20:33,130
this is probably a security fix and it probably is,

478
00:20:33,619 --> 00:20:34,849
does that

479
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,530
gain any substantial benefit to the universe

480
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:41,390
if you can do that? And my argument is that

481
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:45,709
-- probably
-- not substantial. No, it's one of those 5 10% things.

482
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:48,390
But the thing is if you are a mossad, then you don't care,

483
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,489
you just pay for that 5 10% advantage.

484
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,849
They don't need a Linux kernel vulnerability either. They could.

485
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:58,209
There's a million other things they can do to attack. I would view it as

486
00:20:58,349 --> 00:21:02,614
they will add this their toolbox, but they don't technically need. It.

487
00:21:02,665 --> 00:21:05,344
Always got me is of all the pen testers.

488
00:21:05,354 --> 00:21:09,795
I know and I know quite a few, not a single one of them has ever really failed.

489
00:21:09,805 --> 00:21:14,935
They never fail because so this is one of the easiest examples I give in this space.

490
00:21:14,944 --> 00:21:15,305
And this was,

491
00:21:15,314 --> 00:21:17,484
I actually learned this talking to a lawyer a long time

492
00:21:17,494 --> 00:21:21,555
ago about some Microsoft shenanigans around the open document foundation.

493
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:22,974
But fundamentally

494
00:21:23,444 --> 00:21:25,515
when you are the red team,

495
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,869
the red team only has to succeed once they can try a million times,

496
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,160
they have to succeed once.

497
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:34,699
Well, and they get to pick the playing field, they get to pick the timing, right.

498
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:37,579
-- They have no rules.
-- Exactly. Well, they get to pick the game.

499
00:21:37,849 --> 00:21:39,780
Well, it's Kelvin ball for them, right.

500
00:21:40,189 --> 00:21:41,699
When you're the blue team,

501
00:21:41,829 --> 00:21:45,420
you have to win every time and you have to follow the rules.

502
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,680
Like by definition, you will lose 100%.

503
00:21:48,689 --> 00:21:51,910
Well, this is what always gets me about the whole hack back thing where I'm like,

504
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,020
um,

505
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:53,969
no.

506
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:54,780
Yeah.

507
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:55,359
First of all,

508
00:21:55,369 --> 00:21:59,060
you're just going to be attacking some poor schlub who's being used as a bounce,

509
00:21:59,069 --> 00:21:59,880
like a grandma

510
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,140
in Nevada

511
00:22:01,459 --> 00:22:01,540
or

512
00:22:02,469 --> 00:22:03,829
my first thought was when I,

513
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:08,180
when I saw that seriously mentioned in the US politics like years ago, I was like,

514
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,459
wait, you know, what I'm going to do is Russia, I'm going to like,

515
00:22:10,469 --> 00:22:12,250
hack a bunch of Chinese servers from America

516
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,130
and hack a bunch of American servers from China

517
00:22:14,349 --> 00:22:16,400
and like, just get them hacking each other.

518
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:20,089
And then at that point, how do you know it's like the hackers or the hack backing?

519
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,469
And how do you, how do you deescalated? Right. And that's the thing.

520
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:26,660
-- There was no talk of deescalating ever given.
-- There's a simple solution to this.

521
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:27,250
Kurt,

522
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,130
we'll pass a law that says it's illegal

523
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,930
for Russians to use American computers to hack China

524
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,939
-- problem
-- solved.

525
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,170
So,

526
00:22:35,459 --> 00:22:35,589
there we

527
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,180
go. Right.

528
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:38,425
No, you absolutely right.

529
00:22:38,435 --> 00:22:40,505
This is the same story here where we're talking about,

530
00:22:40,515 --> 00:22:42,425
let's attack the supply chain, let's watch github.

531
00:22:42,555 --> 00:22:45,594
Let's, let's do all of these activities in all seriousness.

532
00:22:45,604 --> 00:22:50,584
I think outside of like the bizarre world of like security academia and research,

533
00:22:51,155 --> 00:22:55,104
I'm going to say these don't like, this just isn't practical to focus on this.

534
00:22:55,114 --> 00:22:56,425
And if this is your focus,

535
00:22:56,635 --> 00:23:02,505
-- you are wasting opportunity all over the place.
-- It has happened a few times, but

536
00:23:02,665 --> 00:23:04,214
there's just not been a big deal.

537
00:23:04,224 --> 00:23:07,744
I mean, and even things like specter and meltdown I've never seen

538
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:11,609
or heard of an actual major incident stemming from it,

539
00:23:11,619 --> 00:23:15,660
my guess is they're all Massad type events where we'll never hear about

540
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:21,010
-- them because it's like special ops type stuff
-- and the people that are actually

541
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:24,030
really affected by it are just like, ok, well, this sucks,

542
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,530
but we'll pay to use our own computer, like a dedicated post.

543
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:31,109
-- Right. If you, if you actually care, but most people probably don't care.
-- Yeah.

544
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,380
-- And not do multi-tenant. Right. Right.
-- Exactly.

545
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:36,410
And, and the thing that always kills me is so

546
00:23:36,979 --> 00:23:40,109
I will know people that obsess over things like, oh,

547
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:41,569
we've got to worry about our open source

548
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:45,150
dependencies because someone might attack a third level dependency

549
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,800
and they might put a back door in our software and they might do this and that,

550
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:51,959
and it's like, but your freaking servers haven't been updated in two years, like,

551
00:23:51,969 --> 00:23:53,839
what the heck is wrong with you?

552
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,599
I mean, I remember there, there was actually,

553
00:23:55,609 --> 00:23:59,359
there was a person I was dealing with that was basically doing this of, of they were,

554
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:00,109
I would call them

555
00:24:00,503 --> 00:24:04,733
plot threats and the container images they were running literally

556
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:07,042
had not received a security update in five years.

557
00:24:07,052 --> 00:24:07,593
And I'm like,

558
00:24:07,723 --> 00:24:10,282
holy crap. This is bananas.

559
00:24:10,292 --> 00:24:15,142
-- Well, it's, but the thing is doing the real work is hard
-- and it's not fun.

560
00:24:15,243 --> 00:24:15,662
Right.

561
00:24:15,672 --> 00:24:20,983
Like I would say if you can't update a service or a software product in,

562
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:22,672
depending on the size and complexity of it, you know,

563
00:24:22,682 --> 00:24:25,686
like something like windows 10 cut Microsoft, you know, they get more than a week

564
00:24:25,845 --> 00:24:27,446
but in an emergency,

565
00:24:27,456 --> 00:24:31,026
but basically what it boils down to is if you can't fix something in, say,

566
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,135
between one and three weeks and I don't count

567
00:24:33,145 --> 00:24:35,186
like heroic effort 24 hour days for a week.

568
00:24:35,196 --> 00:24:38,645
I mean, it has to be just sort of a normal business level of activity, not, you know,

569
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,026
the end of the world activity.

570
00:24:40,036 --> 00:24:41,875
If you can't do that, that reliably,

571
00:24:41,885 --> 00:24:44,995
then you got way bigger problems than worrying about security.

572
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:47,036
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And

573
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:51,150
I guess part of that is that the industry is maturing.

574
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,930
-- Well, it
-- reminds me of cars, you know, like the way we do car recalls and stuff. Now,

575
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,170
I remember the first big, uh, Michelin tire recall.

576
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:58,420
It was,

577
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,390
you remember those suvs that would roll over and the tire would pop and all that

578
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,150
and, you know, and I remember the, the,

579
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,650
the news would put on like two affected tires and two non affected

580
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,869
tires on a car and then take it to a variety of shops

581
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:10,800
and, you know, they'd be told anywhere from, like,

582
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,920
all the tires good to all the tires are bad to like,

583
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,969
these two tires are bad and these two tires are good and it was completely wrong.

584
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:16,930
And, you know,

585
00:25:16,939 --> 00:25:19,859
and as a result we got RF ID tags and tires now so that

586
00:25:19,869 --> 00:25:22,979
we can actually track our supply chain and say this tire is good.

587
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:25,900
Or bad or it was actually made by this company on this date.

588
00:25:25,949 --> 00:25:28,449
-- And,
-- and I mean, that's a boring supply chain issue.

589
00:25:28,609 --> 00:25:29,560
-- Putting a serial number
-- on

590
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,500
-- stuff.
-- Security should be accounting.

591
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:34,180
I'm going to, I'm going to keep saying that that's like my new thing.

592
00:25:34,189 --> 00:25:37,560
-- We
-- had that thing with red onions that have, I want to say salmonella or something.

593
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:38,750
We don't know how it happened, but

594
00:25:38,935 --> 00:25:40,474
they're like, just basically don't eat red onions.

595
00:25:40,484 --> 00:25:42,594
And I'm like, well, which ones and they're like these brands. And I'm like,

596
00:25:42,854 --> 00:25:43,685
for example,

597
00:25:43,694 --> 00:25:46,594
I bought a Greek salad from Costco and ate it the other week that had red onions in it.

598
00:25:46,604 --> 00:25:47,224
Like, uh,

599
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:49,035
I seem to be ok,

600
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,175
whatever, you're young enough to make it through salad,

601
00:25:51,285 --> 00:25:54,925
-- it's fine.
-- I've read about it and it sounds horrific. It does.

602
00:25:54,935 --> 00:25:57,435
-- I've never had it, but I don't want it for sure. But
-- that's the thing, right?

603
00:25:57,444 --> 00:26:01,354
Like, just simple stuff, like knowing what your, your supply chain is.

604
00:26:01,709 --> 00:26:06,069
Step one and then, you know, being able to actually execute on updating it

605
00:26:06,349 --> 00:26:07,920
once you can do that, then

606
00:26:08,069 --> 00:26:09,369
worrying about security

607
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,420
makes sense because you can do something about it.

608
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:15,170
Otherwise you're just, it's like me worrying about somebody ram raiding my house,

609
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,900
like, with our car. It's like,

610
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,420
what am I gonna do? Put up

611
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:21,890
-- boards and block off the driveway? You could,
-- but that would be stupid.

612
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,689
I mean, really?

613
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:26,770
And, and so, ok, ok, so we're running out of time. But I wanna,

614
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:31,280
I wanna bring this all home. I'm gonna say if you're a researcher working on this

615
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:32,459
good,

616
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:35,380
right? This is important research and this is important stuff.

617
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,900
However, one of the challenges becomes

618
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:41,650
obviously part of doing research is you want recognition for what you do.

619
00:26:41,949 --> 00:26:44,579
And so the hard part is how do we have

620
00:26:44,589 --> 00:26:48,459
research being done on what is essentially a scary problem

621
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,839
that doesn't end up sensationalized or misrepresented.

622
00:26:51,869 --> 00:26:53,819
And I don't, I don't know the answer to that.

623
00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:55,339
I'd say that's not possible

624
00:26:55,469 --> 00:26:58,719
and maybe there isn't, I think human nature just computer says no.

625
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,459
Well, and it's like you said about, you know, putting,

626
00:27:02,469 --> 00:27:05,430
using a drone to attack things is

627
00:27:05,729 --> 00:27:08,770
there's people doing research on that. There's people trying to understand it.

628
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,709
There's videos of a guy who's hooked up a handgun to his drone and

629
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:16,670
I was like, I checked and it's like, no, the FAA that's really illegal. Is it?

630
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,619
I don't know. Yeah, it's super illegal in the US. And, well, most of the world.

631
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,729
But anyway, anyway, and I guess this is,

632
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,741
this is part of the challenge is, is there,

633
00:27:25,751 --> 00:27:29,251
there is very interesting and amazing security research to do.

634
00:27:29,261 --> 00:27:31,881
There's going to be phenomenal things to discover.

635
00:27:31,891 --> 00:27:34,862
But we also have to make sure we keep everything in context

636
00:27:34,871 --> 00:27:37,151
and we don't just scare people for the sake of scaring them.

637
00:27:37,161 --> 00:27:39,411
And how do we do that? I have no idea.

638
00:27:39,552 --> 00:27:44,212
Yeah, because I do see research into stuff where it's like, cool.

639
00:27:44,232 --> 00:27:46,871
Is there anything actionable we can actually do about that?

640
00:27:46,881 --> 00:27:49,342
-- And that's a good point too. You know,
-- it's like

641
00:27:49,562 --> 00:27:51,453
the whole meteorites hitting the earth thing.

642
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:52,894
I, I, part of me is like,

643
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:55,573
we should spend more money monitoring for meteorites that might hit the earth.

644
00:27:55,593 --> 00:27:58,774
But part of me is like, but why we can't do anything about it, like,

645
00:27:58,784 --> 00:28:01,093
-- we can't redirect them
-- space force.

646
00:28:01,104 --> 00:28:01,644
Yo.

647
00:28:01,784 --> 00:28:04,173
Oh wait, they don't do anything. Um But anyway,

648
00:28:04,463 --> 00:28:06,173
I'm not really clear on them either. Yeah,

649
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:06,904
but you know what I'm saying?

650
00:28:06,913 --> 00:28:08,254
Like part of me is like, yeah, we should,

651
00:28:08,264 --> 00:28:10,213
we should have more monitoring of meteorites.

652
00:28:10,223 --> 00:28:12,354
I might smack into the earth and cause problems. But

653
00:28:12,543 --> 00:28:17,196
again, like, what are we going? Do you guys have some secret armored space shuttle?

654
00:28:17,206 --> 00:28:18,375
We don't know about that. That

655
00:28:18,485 --> 00:28:18,615
would be

656
00:28:19,076 --> 00:28:21,365
-- to nuke on it. I feel like the answer is
-- no.

657
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:24,046
Also I'm going to apologize in advance for everyone listening.

658
00:28:24,056 --> 00:28:26,526
Who's a space nerd and carts misuse of the word meteorite.

659
00:28:26,536 --> 00:28:28,965
-- So,
-- oh shoot, you're right. I apologize

660
00:28:28,975 --> 00:28:28,995
for

661
00:28:30,215 --> 00:28:30,416
asteroids.

662
00:28:31,536 --> 00:28:34,166
-- Well, no, wait, wouldn't. Which
-- meteorites hit the ground, right?

663
00:28:34,215 --> 00:28:36,686
Meteors are flying through the air. Meteorites hit the ground.

664
00:28:36,696 --> 00:28:37,645
Asteroids are in space.

665
00:28:37,656 --> 00:28:39,745
I was technically correct because we worry about the ones that hit

666
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:41,540
by the

667
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:44,040
when they are meteorites. We're all dead. So we don't care.

668
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,119
We care about asteroids. Those we might be able to do something about.

669
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:48,989
I feel like spacex

670
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:51,680
doesn't have some plan for that yet. Maybe give them 20 years.

671
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:52,890
-- This
-- might be a good thing.

672
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,199
I'm going to think about this a little bit

673
00:28:54,209 --> 00:28:55,829
because I think you might be onto something.

674
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:59,500
But at the same time, let's say we knew an asteroid was coming.

675
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,800
I have an answer and that is,

676
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:04,520
it's good to know sort of the logarithmic scale of a problem.

677
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:06,160
Is this a once a year thing or 10 times

678
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:11,060
-- thing or 10 times a day thing or once a century thing? Every
-- 30 million years?

679
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:15,010
So, and that's what I, you know, with a lot of these security flaws, I'm like, well,

680
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:15,589
how

681
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:18,660
bad and how often do these actually happen?

682
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:19,750
Like I want to get a sense of,

683
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,910
I don't need specific numbers but at least an order of magnitude.

684
00:29:23,069 --> 00:29:26,630
So I can say it's, is it like a 10 or 100 or 1000 problem?

685
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,800
Yeah, because how we handle that, if it's a 10 problem,

686
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,390
we can just handle them one off.

687
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:34,069
But if it's 1000 or a 10,000 problem,

688
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:36,790
then we probably need some automated tooling to handle it

689
00:29:37,579 --> 00:29:39,790
and we should invest some time and money in making it go away.

690
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,150
Yeah, I agree with that too.

691
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,589
Alright. Alright, I'm calling this,

692
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,660
this is and I need to think about this

693
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,430
aid thing. I like it. I like it anyway. All right. Thank you, Kurt.
