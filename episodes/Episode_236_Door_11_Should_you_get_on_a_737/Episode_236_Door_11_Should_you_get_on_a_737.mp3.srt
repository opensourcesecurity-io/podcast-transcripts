Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,230
Kurtz Fried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Bresser

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:11,350
-- December 11th.
-- So 67 reasons you shouldn't get on a 737 max.

3
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:13,579
Why? 67? I don't understand that.

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,090
Well, honestly, there's, there's a couple of big ones,

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,340
but I just made it up an arbitrary number.

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,250
Ok. And I'm guessing that, I mean, that's,

7
00:00:20,409 --> 00:00:20,819
you know,

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,790
and, and I hate to say, but what it really boils down to at

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:29,190
the sort of meta level is that this whole industry effort to create a plane that was,

10
00:00:29,549 --> 00:00:32,909
you know, cheap in the sense of it was a better plane than the 737.

11
00:00:32,919 --> 00:00:36,340
But it was also similar enough that pilots wouldn't have to recertify, you know,

12
00:00:36,349 --> 00:00:41,200
resulted in a lot of changes to the 737 that actually made it fly very differently.

13
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:44,610
So they added this automated system, mcas to essentially

14
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,529
prevent the plane from crashing

15
00:00:47,419 --> 00:00:49,169
because that'll, that's a thing, right?

16
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,950
The, the plane is unstable in certain configurations because of, well,

17
00:00:51,959 --> 00:00:56,229
they put the engines high and forwards which change the balance and anyways.

18
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,790
The idea being that, you know, you, you take a couple hour refresher course and boom,

19
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:00,840
you're good to fly this plane.

20
00:01:00,849 --> 00:01:02,169
And as we know that didn't

21
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,550
turn out too well for, well, there was at least two fatal plane crashes.

22
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:07,440
So,

23
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:12,230
you know, it's wild is you put this in the, the notes

24
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:15,250
and I had completely forgotten

25
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,019
that the 737 was even a thing

26
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,809
just from everything else.

27
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:22,290
-- And the fact that
-- it's the school bus of the airman,

28
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,529
-- I
-- haven't gotten on an airplane in,

29
00:01:25,029 --> 00:01:26,930
I don't even remember how long it's been.

30
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,290
It's been, I don't know what, I don't know what an airport looks like anymore.

31
00:01:30,419 --> 00:01:31,330
You know, it's terrifying.

32
00:01:31,339 --> 00:01:32,540
Somebody posted pictures of that,

33
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,550
those Thanksgiving busy airports in the US and they were packed

34
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:37,290
well,

35
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,569
by this point in time because it's

36
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,059
totally not November right now before Thanksgiving.

37
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:46,550
Yeah, by, by the time this airs we will know if there was,

38
00:01:46,559 --> 00:01:49,269
or wasn't some sort of obnoxious aftermath.

39
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,169
So,

40
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,769
I guess future dwellers, I wish you. Well,

41
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,730
good luck.

42
00:01:54,099 --> 00:02:00,319
-- Anyway, 737 would you get on a 737 today?
-- Well, 737 max, and the answer is no,

43
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:00,540
I

44
00:02:00,809 --> 00:02:02,839
wouldn't get on a 737 max for

45
00:02:02,949 --> 00:02:04,910
more than just the 737 max.

46
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,989
The pandemic. Ignoring the,

47
00:02:07,529 --> 00:02:08,800
would I get on this plane

48
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:13,259
and the answer is no, but also they're not certified to fly in Canada yet.

49
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,899
Like the FAA is certifying them to fly and

50
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,539
it looks like Europe's going to follow suit.

51
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,679
I would somewhat trust it in Canada

52
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:24,042
in the sense of Canada, Europe, the US are kind of rich enough to actually, you know,

53
00:02:24,052 --> 00:02:26,643
have the pilots go through training and stuff, but in other parts of the world,

54
00:02:26,652 --> 00:02:28,563
do you think they're not going to take shortcuts?

55
00:02:28,572 --> 00:02:32,082
So why, so wait a minute, you're saying

56
00:02:32,272 --> 00:02:33,063
that

57
00:02:33,302 --> 00:02:37,322
the pilots have to take new training to make the plane not crash?

58
00:02:37,332 --> 00:02:40,723
Well, they have to understand what the MCAS system is and does because it's,

59
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:44,253
it's the pilots, the two fatal crashes appear to have been the pilot,

60
00:02:44,382 --> 00:02:48,382
the MCAS system kicked in and tried to put the nose of the plane down so that it,

61
00:02:48,466 --> 00:02:49,925
you know, would gain speed and not crash.

62
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,285
And of course, the pilots, like, no, we're trying to take off. That's not,

63
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:53,526
that's not how this works

64
00:02:53,686 --> 00:02:56,716
and they pull up and they, they essentially weren't expecting the MC A S system.

65
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:58,766
And the thing is if you are expecting it and you've

66
00:02:58,776 --> 00:03:00,565
been trained in it and you know exactly what to do,

67
00:03:00,576 --> 00:03:01,526
it's, it's a non problem

68
00:03:01,936 --> 00:03:05,485
and if you don't know what's going on or you're not trained to deal with it.

69
00:03:05,496 --> 00:03:07,305
Well, we had two fatal accidents.

70
00:03:07,436 --> 00:03:09,546
So, like there's your answer. And so

71
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:10,046
my,

72
00:03:10,055 --> 00:03:13,365
my concern too is apparently this mcast stuff and some of the behavior of the plane,

73
00:03:13,376 --> 00:03:15,526
it's all software driven So it's like an option,

74
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,240
but not all the planes had.

75
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,649
Oh. Right. That's right. Because you had to buy an add on. I,

76
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:24,119
-- I, I'm remembering this now. It's been a long time.
-- Right.

77
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,720
This whole thing is just such a giant cluster of, I mean,

78
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:30,360
and this really speaks to iot safety in that typically IOT devices, you know,

79
00:03:30,369 --> 00:03:32,360
aren't full of jet fuel and taking off with

80
00:03:32,369 --> 00:03:35,979
-- hundreds of people on board and
-- airplanes are heavily regulated

81
00:03:36,179 --> 00:03:38,850
as we're well aware, IOT has

82
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,240
no regulation at all.

83
00:03:41,537 --> 00:03:42,617
So like I said, I know

84
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:42,876
a

85
00:03:43,016 --> 00:03:45,537
big part of the problem is I no longer trust the FAA, right?

86
00:03:45,546 --> 00:03:49,766
Because the way the FAA, well, what the FAA did to lead up to this was failure.

87
00:03:49,776 --> 00:03:52,447
And I would say the way the FAA handled this is a failure.

88
00:03:52,457 --> 00:03:55,046
And I think that speaks to a larger

89
00:03:55,296 --> 00:04:00,046
discussion for the world of security is that if there's certain groups,

90
00:04:00,057 --> 00:04:04,317
we have to put our trust in to, I guess, keep us on the right path.

91
00:04:04,326 --> 00:04:06,886
And I mean, I've seen this happen with like security

92
00:04:06,994 --> 00:04:09,473
groups and companies is if your security

93
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:12,214
group becomes untrusted by the organization,

94
00:04:12,223 --> 00:04:14,083
it is a very bad outcome.

95
00:04:14,093 --> 00:04:16,753
And honestly, there's generally speaking,

96
00:04:16,764 --> 00:04:20,473
you just have to clean a house and you've got to get rid of all of them and bring them,

97
00:04:20,483 --> 00:04:22,813
bring all new people in because there's no way to fix it.

98
00:04:22,824 --> 00:04:24,123
We've already seen this happen like with

99
00:04:24,384 --> 00:04:26,153
doing self certification programs, you know,

100
00:04:26,164 --> 00:04:28,614
underwriter laboratories used to be the gold standard for this thing.

101
00:04:28,623 --> 00:04:29,574
Won't burn your house down.

102
00:04:29,584 --> 00:04:32,454
And then they brought in a self certification thing, like almost

103
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:33,180
decades ago.

104
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:34,661
And there's, now I forget the mark,

105
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:37,501
but it's a self certification done by the company, blah, blah, blah.

106
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,131
And it's like I buy IOT devices and I noticed that,

107
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,990
that it's not ul it's that wonky self certified thing.

108
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:44,540
And I'm like, well, great,

109
00:04:45,071 --> 00:04:48,881
I guess how do we recreate these institutions with

110
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,240
trust when all the market forces want to come

111
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:52,781
out with the cheapest products that may or may

112
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,710
not burn your house down like those ring doorbells.

113
00:04:54,721 --> 00:04:57,851
And lucky for us, we're out of time. So we don't have to try to answer that.

114
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:00,529
I'm all right with that.

115
00:05:00,869 --> 00:05:03,399
We will see you all on December 12th.
