Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:10,300
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Standing.

2
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,050
-- Josh Pressers.
-- That's the worst one ever.

3
00:00:13,229 --> 00:00:16,989
Yes, Kurt and I are both standing. I always stand when we record and Kurt

4
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:21,239
made his desk go up. So now he's standing and he's all proud of himself so well done.

5
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,700
Kurt claps to you.

6
00:00:22,709 --> 00:00:26,719
Well, it's annoying because I've always enjoyed like walking and eating,

7
00:00:26,729 --> 00:00:27,399
walking and

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,100
thinking, walking and talking.

9
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,610
And the other day I was watching TV, while standing and I'm like,

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,250
this is better than sitting

11
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:34,319
and I have,

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,689
and I've had a sit stand desk forever.

13
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:39,130
Like I have, I have one of the original geek desks that

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,330
was rated for 350 pounds. Like my kids used to try and ride it up and down.

15
00:00:45,069 --> 00:00:48,409
So I'm, I'm just, yeah, I need to, I need to do more things. Standing.

16
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,090
That's fair.

17
00:00:49,099 --> 00:00:51,110
And they keep saying that sitting is going to

18
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:53,939
be like the next health epidemic of our generation.

19
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:55,470
-- So we'll see
-- actually the,

20
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:58,069
the thing that's actually being pushed heavily this week in Canada

21
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,659
is warning labels on alcohol that alcohol probably causes cancer.

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,319
Ok.

23
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,190
Except that, that amuses me because alcohol causes cancer,

24
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:09,449
but wine is good for you and I don't know what to do.

25
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,730
Well, I also suspect that alcohol

26
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,290
generally is worse than just cancer and we already knew that.

27
00:01:15,889 --> 00:01:18,889
-- Probably
-- like drunk driving.

28
00:01:20,089 --> 00:01:23,370
Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of negative consequences for sure.

29
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:27,139
-- Humans, man, I don't know. I,
-- I can't, I'm not giving up processed meats or alcohol,

30
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,010
so I guess I better start standing more.

31
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,449
There you go. That sounds like the right solution.

32
00:01:31,989 --> 00:01:33,690
Love me. My bacon and ham.

33
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,389
Yeah. Get the, uh, the treadmill like

34
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,730
Liis has. So you can do zombie shuffle while he programs,

35
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,330
uh, you know, I've done that

36
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,809
in the past. I haven't in a while.

37
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,919
I got a new treadmill and it's a little more inconvenient.

38
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:46,910
I, I had like a,

39
00:01:46,919 --> 00:01:49,830
a thing I built that sat on top of my old treadmill and I

40
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:52,650
put my computer on it and I would walk while I did stuff.

41
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,690
I mean, it was fine. I can't complain.

42
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:57,769
It, it just then I got a new treadmill and I, I'm kind of lazy and I,

43
00:01:57,779 --> 00:02:00,620
I ride my bike every morning so I don't concern myself with it that much.

44
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:02,989
I did that when I wasn't regularly exercising.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,970
But, yeah, I mean, it's fine anyway, we have a topic today.

46
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,650
-- Well,
-- that leads us, I mean, this is getting old.

47
00:02:07,724 --> 00:02:09,904
Ashley is literally leads us into the show today,

48
00:02:09,913 --> 00:02:15,104
which is the Noda outage and in a completely related thing, a IX is not dead.

49
00:02:15,115 --> 00:02:17,395
It's just we fired all the devs in North

50
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:20,044
America and moved development work to a foreign country.

51
00:02:20,764 --> 00:02:21,985
Why do you keep saying this?

52
00:02:21,994 --> 00:02:25,585
You've been pushing me for like four days that we should do a show about

53
00:02:25,595 --> 00:02:27,945
a IX is not dead and I don't even know what you're talking about.

54
00:02:27,955 --> 00:02:29,664
Is there a new, did something happen?

55
00:02:29,945 --> 00:02:34,235
Yeah. So last week IBM basically announced that all the development work for A IX

56
00:02:34,494 --> 00:02:36,384
has been offshored to India.

57
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:42,110
So like all, you know, all those old people that have been working on A X for decades.

58
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:47,050
Yeah, they don't work on A AX anymore. It's a bunch of new people in India.

59
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,649
OK. I found, I found a new story here.

60
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:49,830
Uh

61
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:53,449
-- This does not surprise me in any way. Well,
-- it's on life support.

62
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,080
Look, it, it's literally like the NOT

63
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,679
M system is on life support. Like there's no future for a IX. Like

64
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,479
I, I posted that video. Uh I, I didn't realize that. I remember the uh the IBM Linux,

65
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,580
those weird Linux commercials. They had, they were 20 years ago.

66
00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:12,820
-- I loved those. Those were so good
-- 20 years ago in 2003. I,

67
00:03:13,179 --> 00:03:18,050
I, so I worked for a Linux start up called Progeny Linux Systems at the time

68
00:03:18,339 --> 00:03:18,889
and

69
00:03:19,309 --> 00:03:23,869
Linux was like unheard of right? It was, you were a crazy person if you were like

70
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,330
basing your career off Linux

71
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:29,979
in those days and we were like, so excited for those commercials. It was amazing.

72
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:31,619
And that was in the middle of the skull

73
00:03:31,789 --> 00:03:36,399
-- lawsuit as well, wasn't it?
-- Well, the school lawsuit was like a half decade of, of f

74
00:03:36,529 --> 00:03:37,750
and you know, shenanigans,

75
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,149
it lasted forever. Right. And,

76
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:41,750
and that was funny too because

77
00:03:41,869 --> 00:03:43,630
so a fun fact that I, I don't,

78
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:47,429
I don't think I've ever told this story in public before is when I was at Progeny,

79
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,429
they brought on Ransom Love as an advisor and

80
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,699
ransom Love was the what he was involved with sco

81
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:56,429
in some way as part of that lawsuit.

82
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,539
And we went out for lunch one day and we like grilled him

83
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,470
and he was super honest about it and he was basically like,

84
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,360
yeah, Microsoft told us we had to do this and so we're doing it and, and like he,

85
00:04:06,369 --> 00:04:07,320
he exited

86
00:04:07,529 --> 00:04:10,559
that universe by this time. So he wasn't directly involved.

87
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:11,339
Well,

88
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,399
-- he was one of the founders but
-- he like totally

89
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,240
threw Microsoft under the bus and it was like,

90
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,950
wow, this is amazing.

91
00:04:17,309 --> 00:04:21,160
-- But
-- anyway, that was literally the decade of throwing Microsoft under the bus.

92
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,864
Well, that's true. And it was everyone knew it.

93
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:27,894
I mean, everyone knew it, but it was never like officially announced

94
00:04:27,994 --> 00:04:30,734
the Halloween memos where Microsoft is literally, you know,

95
00:04:30,744 --> 00:04:33,364
calling Linux a cancer and saying we have to stomp it out.

96
00:04:33,654 --> 00:04:34,984
Yeah, but they didn't say like, yes,

97
00:04:34,994 --> 00:04:39,184
-- we're going to have a third party file a lawsuit against IB
-- M.

98
00:04:39,325 --> 00:04:40,744
Well, it was pretty obvious

99
00:04:40,954 --> 00:04:43,885
anyway, that's not our topic today. Ok. So, whatever a IX.

100
00:04:43,894 --> 00:04:46,994
So a fun fact also I was in a Ixs

101
00:04:47,105 --> 00:04:49,054
Edmund as my first job out of college.

102
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,059
And I would have confidently said a IX was on

103
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:55,720
life support back then because it was difficult to use.

104
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,950
It was not well supported. They were not doing a lot of releases.

105
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:03,839
It was clearly not the growing part of IBM at that time.

106
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:05,959
Well, and I think the thing to remember is

107
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,000
in the nineties and early aughts, Linux

108
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:14,570
-- and the B sds were not yet a contender.
-- Well, and, and fun fact when I was in a Ixs

109
00:05:14,739 --> 00:05:15,200
edin,

110
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,750
I would of course suggest we deploy Linux to solve whatever problem we were

111
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,019
going to pay an insane amount of money for a AX systems to solve.

112
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,929
And of course, I was always told like, you're a crazy person. No.

113
00:05:26,269 --> 00:05:26,859
And

114
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,459
yeah, how'd that work out?

115
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:29,059
Yeah.

116
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:30,920
Well, but I'm just reminded of like,

117
00:05:30,929 --> 00:05:33,700
because one of the questions I've been asked a few times is like, why?

118
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:37,709
It's kind of like the car industry. There were how many unixes back in the day? Like

119
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,329
you had

120
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:39,489
skull, you had

121
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,329
a Ixh pox digi

122
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:42,010
UNIX.

123
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,220
Actually, I found, I found a video the other day,

124
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,489
I will try to dig this up and see if I can find it again.

125
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,059
I'll put it in the show

126
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,029
but

127
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,470
Apple had a UNIX you can run on the Macintosh

128
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:58,549
back in like the late like 89 or 88 or so, which I never even heard of

129
00:05:58,989 --> 00:05:59,149
a U

130
00:05:59,250 --> 00:05:59,739
X.

131
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:00,239
-- Was it
-- a

132
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,440
-- Yeah. Yeah, that's
-- it.

133
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,459
It was literally

134
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:05,510
like everything was something slash UX or IX.

135
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:09,029
And there's another video I found I'll try to dig this one up too

136
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:09,850
that

137
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,899
this person tried to use the Windows. NT Posi

138
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,459
like compatibility layer to like compile and run a program.

139
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,559
And the video is hilarious because it is clear

140
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,200
that

141
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:23,809
the posi

142
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:28,929
layer in windows existed only for compliance and only

143
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,040
to pass whatever test nist made them run well.

144
00:06:32,049 --> 00:06:34,920
What else would you have written it to do other than to test to the test?

145
00:06:35,309 --> 00:06:38,059
Well, that obviously it wasn't for compatibility.

146
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:41,149
-- I
-- mean, what's interesting too is like if you look at it, this is going off the rails,

147
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,820
but NT four had the hardware abstraction layer, remember how

148
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:47,019
so NT four actually ran on top of Intel and

149
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,459
on top of alpha,

150
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,459
the alpha,

151
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:52,200
right? And, and the idea was to make it agnostic

152
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:53,769
and you basically have this hal

153
00:06:53,869 --> 00:06:55,220
this hardware abstraction layer

154
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:57,019
with running on top of

155
00:06:57,269 --> 00:07:00,390
literally anything that you could plug into a wall with windows running on top of it.

156
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:00,929
And of course,

157
00:07:01,299 --> 00:07:02,369
it just

158
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:05,980
that kind of generalization is very expensive and complicated and you know,

159
00:07:05,989 --> 00:07:08,329
just let's go to X 86 and be done with it.

160
00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:11,250
Just like how X 8664 be O Titanium?

161
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,500
Because it's like your choices are write this thing

162
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:16,119
slightly differently or write this thing completely differently.

163
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,040
And of course, every vendor on the planet's like

164
00:07:18,369 --> 00:07:19,690
I want the first one.

165
00:07:20,109 --> 00:07:24,500
Of course. Exactly. Exactly. That and, and so funny enough you bring up I

166
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,160
Itanic in the progeny days,

167
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:31,579
we were paid by Hewlett Packard to Port

168
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:33,339
Debian to the Titanium.

169
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:37,959
And we had like a room full, we probably had millions of dollars of Titanium gear,

170
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,980
just like sitting in a closet in the back.

171
00:07:39,989 --> 00:07:42,529
And it was, I mean, it was powered on. They were gigantic

172
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,700
and it was, it was hilarious.

173
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:49,529
I'm sorry. The title of this one article, Linux helps bring Titanic to life

174
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,369
anyway.

175
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:54,040
And

176
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:54,589
half

177
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,250
of our listeners probably don't even know what

178
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,959
Titanium is and they're Googling it right now.

179
00:07:57,989 --> 00:07:58,179
Just

180
00:07:58,329 --> 00:08:01,899
-- don't, you know what? It's not, it, it was, it
-- was a dead end

181
00:08:02,059 --> 00:08:08,489
Intel tried to make an alternative chip that in theory was vastly superior.

182
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:10,040
-- You
-- know what they tried to do.

183
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,049
They tried to out engineer, son.

184
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,799
-- I mean, probably
-- that's no, when you look at Itanic, it was,

185
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:17,839
they were trying to go up against like the Sun Enterprise

186
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,130
10-K style of thing.

187
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:23,470
Yeah, probably. And it was a really cool chip, like, don't get me wrong, but it was

188
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,070
like you couldn't get anything to work right on it because it

189
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,510
-- was just so complicated and
-- the performance gains were just not.

190
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:32,669
-- Well,
-- that's because we couldn't get any software to run on it correctly.

191
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,789
You had to write like special software that

192
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,989
did like weird asynchronous stuff and it's not,

193
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,539
the solution was just threads and cores and whatever, everything's fine.

194
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:45,080
-- But
-- see, that's the thing with these, with these older systems.

195
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:50,270
Like, again, iii I now firmly believe that I have a theory of like it adoption where

196
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,530
if a system is

197
00:08:52,349 --> 00:08:57,070
essentially more than a few years old, it becomes legacy like and I mean,

198
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,080
even Windows like windows is very actively supported

199
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:00,739
but

200
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:01,109
you know,

201
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:03,039
like Windows XP at some point gets kind of put

202
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:05,250
on life support by Microsoft and then killed off.

203
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:05,919
And I think,

204
00:09:06,099 --> 00:09:08,150
I think a decent rule of thumb is any it

205
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:11,799
system more than five years old is basically legacy.

206
00:09:11,809 --> 00:09:13,840
-- Sure,
-- sure, I won't disagree with that.

207
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,450
But what's interesting is by definition, it's also super needed.

208
00:09:17,674 --> 00:09:18,734
If you could just get rid of it,

209
00:09:18,744 --> 00:09:20,905
you would if you could just easily upgrade it

210
00:09:20,914 --> 00:09:23,905
or outsource it to a cloud service like email.

211
00:09:23,914 --> 00:09:25,015
Oh man, email. You know what?

212
00:09:25,025 --> 00:09:28,414
Oh, there's like a million kajillions email providers now. Super simple.

213
00:09:28,424 --> 00:09:30,184
Cobalt, Cobalt is my favorite example.

214
00:09:30,505 --> 00:09:35,494
How much I mean, I I have no doubt that if, if Cobalt disappeared today,

215
00:09:35,515 --> 00:09:36,604
society would crumble.

216
00:09:36,614 --> 00:09:37,104
Oh yeah.

217
00:09:37,114 --> 00:09:39,614
No, all literally every well not every, like,

218
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,875
probably 50% of all of your government support payment checks would.

219
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,070
Yeah.

220
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:44,510
Yeah,

221
00:09:44,789 --> 00:09:46,789
I'm sure there's loads of banks with it and stuff.

222
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,479
So I want to tie this into the thing I actually wanted to talk about today,

223
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:53,539
which is the, no, T A outage, which no,

224
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,539
T A for anyone who doesn't know we'll kind of give a little background.

225
00:09:55,549 --> 00:09:57,419
There's this system, the FAA in America,

226
00:09:57,429 --> 00:10:02,039
the Federal Aviation Administration has called notice to air mission system.

227
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,960
Is that what it stands for? Notice to air mission?

228
00:10:05,369 --> 00:10:05,900
So,

229
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,909
so basically what happens?

230
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,080
And this is all, what I, you probably understand this better than I do, but I,

231
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,359
I'm gonna talk about it because I can

232
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,780
is there's a system that basically helps airplanes not like run into

233
00:10:17,789 --> 00:10:19,820
each other and stay out of places they shouldn't be in,

234
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,369
in North America,

235
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:20,530
the

236
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:20,700
Super

237
00:10:20,969 --> 00:10:21,140
Bowl,

238
00:10:22,609 --> 00:10:24,960
like every Super Bowl, there's a no time air restriction

239
00:10:25,229 --> 00:10:28,010
or, or my favorite is the President's airplane.

240
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,820
If another airplane goes near the president's airplane, it's going to be shot down,

241
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,090
right?

242
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:32,849
100%.

243
00:10:32,859 --> 00:10:33,299
Well,

244
00:10:33,349 --> 00:10:35,450
and I've actually experienced that because I was flying out of

245
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,489
North Carolina just made it before they shut down the,

246
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,530
the, the entrance to the airport because Air Force one was landing

247
00:10:41,789 --> 00:10:45,609
and then we were actually the first flight out after he landed and it,

248
00:10:45,619 --> 00:10:47,289
we had to wait like a solid half hour on the

249
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:50,330
tarmac and the and the pilots just like this thing landed,

250
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,260
we don't get to move.

251
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,090
Yep.

252
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:54,450
That's it. That's my announcement.

253
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,580
I mean, I, I was in Boston,

254
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,609
we just landed and we're sitting there and the pilot's like, oh,

255
00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:02,150
if you look out the left window you'll see air force one landing,

256
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,409
which is why we can't move.

257
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:07,150
If we do move, they're going to shoot us. So we're just going to sit here for a while.

258
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:09,929
It's like, ok, that's neat.

259
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:10,919
Anyway,

260
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,609
so this system, this, this no damn system.

261
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:16,130
-- Well,
-- this is one of the reasons air travel is actually very safe.

262
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:19,549
Well, right, right, about a week ago, from the time we're chatting,

263
00:11:19,619 --> 00:11:21,479
this system had an outage

264
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,450
and it,

265
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,429
they, so this is funny because they,

266
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,969
a lot of news stories they were coming out of Europe said the planes were grounded,

267
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,119
which in Europe grounded means can't take off.

268
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:34,489
And the US grounded means like you're landing all of the airplanes right now.

269
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,419
And that happened

270
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:37,570
on September 11th in 2001

271
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,590
when there were the attacks on the World Trade Center.

272
00:11:39,739 --> 00:11:41,809
So we literally like every airport in North American

273
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,150
airspace was told to get on the ground now.

274
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,789
Right. And that's what we call grounded.

275
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:49,330
So we're, we wake up, we're like grounded, what's going on? This is wild.

276
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,710
And so it was just, they couldn't take off, right, which was still made a mess. But

277
00:11:52,849 --> 00:11:53,669
anyway,

278
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:58,909
there is an outage. No airplanes could take off. It created chaos for a day. And then

279
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,020
there's a bunch of what's going on,

280
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:04,109
what just happened and it turns out there was a bad update

281
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:08,400
and a corrupt file on a computer and then everyone says, oh, you know,

282
00:12:08,409 --> 00:12:09,840
this is ridiculous.

283
00:12:09,849 --> 00:12:12,080
And they're, they're talking about, do you hear one person did it?

284
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,039
I'm like, no, one person didn't do it,

285
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:17,280
literally decades of mismanagement and poor planning did this.

286
00:12:17,289 --> 00:12:17,630
Like,

287
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,640
if you can,

288
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,979
if you have one corrupt file on one computer and

289
00:12:20,989 --> 00:12:23,590
it takes down all of aviation in your country,

290
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:28,119
the problem isn't one computer or a person, it is structural.

291
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,929
This is like when you hear people be like,

292
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:30,590
oh

293
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,250
if like we got hacked because this user clicked the link.

294
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,239
It's like, no, you got hacked because your security policies are terrible.

295
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,359
Like one person did not cause this to happen.

296
00:12:39,469 --> 00:12:39,890
-- Well,
-- and it's,

297
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,359
it's almost worse in a way because it's

298
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:43,500
not even a technical outage that actually like,

299
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:47,080
it's not like the southwest outage where like their, it systems just crumbled

300
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,599
and they didn't know where their flight crews were and all that.

301
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,229
Like no

302
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,119
time is,

303
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,880
it's part of regulation and the regulations say if not time ain't working well,

304
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:56,780
nobody's flying,

305
00:12:57,369 --> 00:12:58,020
right. Which

306
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,630
makes it, then it's fine. I'm ok with that.

307
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,169
People could still get the no

308
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,390
tams, but they'd have to do it like verbally and there's just too many damn

309
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,070
noms. Like there's literally hundreds of these a day.

310
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,250
And so typically they split them up by geo

311
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,349
geographic regions and stuff because like,

312
00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:13,390
if you're flying from Florida to New York,

313
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:14,570
you don't care about

314
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:15,630
noms in California,

315
00:13:16,469 --> 00:13:16,750
right?

316
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:19,359
And that's, and this is the problem is also

317
00:13:19,659 --> 00:13:21,340
is that we have like this hyper

318
00:13:21,489 --> 00:13:22,710
efficient system

319
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,039
that is operating right at the edge of its, you know, envelope of capability.

320
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,359
And so when it fails, it, it doesn't degrade gracefully.

321
00:13:30,369 --> 00:13:32,219
It's not like Netflix where like Netflix has

322
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:34,099
a system where when stuff starts to fail,

323
00:13:34,109 --> 00:13:35,869
they like, oh, we don't give you your preferences,

324
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,510
but you can still find stuff and stream, you can still do the core mission of Netflix,

325
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,380
which is like, I want to watch my cartoons or whatever,

326
00:13:41,539 --> 00:13:44,419
right? When no dam fails, it's just like no bloop, it's dead.

327
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:46,700
You know, there's no graceful degradation.

328
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,919
-- They, they sort of tried that and it failed
-- quick.

329
00:13:48,969 --> 00:13:52,080
We should talk about that for a moment because I think

330
00:13:52,359 --> 00:13:55,520
it's important to recognize that Netflix is not a,

331
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:59,799
a safety critical system that if it fails, people will die

332
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,000
trying to degrade a system. Like Notam

333
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:06,679
will probably result in death and destruction

334
00:14:06,869 --> 00:14:11,039
versus just saying we have to let it completely fail

335
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:12,979
and restart it. All

336
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:13,590
right. I

337
00:14:13,739 --> 00:14:16,119
think that's an important thing to remember.

338
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:19,429
Well, OK, like a better example, might be degrading the phone system where

339
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:21,280
you know what happens when the phone system gets

340
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:23,340
clobbered by too many calls or outages or whatever.

341
00:14:23,349 --> 00:14:25,039
Right? And there's, you know, it,

342
00:14:25,349 --> 00:14:27,549
the thing to remember too is like grounding all the

343
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:29,799
flights can also result in deaths like medical flights,

344
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:33,080
you know, those people need to go places. But anyways ignoring that

345
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:37,659
medical, medical flights don't make the news, plane crashes do.

346
00:14:38,489 --> 00:14:39,239
But so what,

347
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:43,030
what's fascinating to me is let's experimentally like let's mind game this out.

348
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:43,369
So

349
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:46,400
they ingest a file to the system

350
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:49,869
obviously. And the file was processed and then distributed

351
00:14:50,469 --> 00:14:53,280
and a corrupt file caused the system to essentially hang.

352
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:56,679
And then of course, they passed the, the bad file to the backup system

353
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,580
and it caused the backup system to hang

354
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,159
in the exact same way because they're identical,

355
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:00,799
obviously.

356
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:02,140
So

357
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:05,200
option A, there's no sort of precheck.

358
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:08,630
There's no like file parser that goes like, ok, it's a good clean file,

359
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,169
feed it into the system or worse.

360
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,929
There is a precheck

361
00:15:13,099 --> 00:15:15,659
and it failed. It passed the file through anyways.

362
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:18,260
Yeah, that's the thing I've been wondering about

363
00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:19,450
because I'm,

364
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,419
I'm skeptical there was no testing done

365
00:15:22,619 --> 00:15:26,859
because I've done when, when I was at Red Hat, we did some work with like the FAA

366
00:15:27,549 --> 00:15:29,099
and they have

367
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,760
obnoxious requirements, we just say,

368
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:36,830
and it is obviously for a reason because like when planes fall out of the sky,

369
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:38,479
it bad, it's bad

370
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:41,590
or even just bump into each other a little bit on the tarmac it's expensive.

371
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:42,349
Right.

372
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,340
And so they have

373
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,469
enormous just requirements you have to deal with. And so

374
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:52,109
I would be shocked if there was no

375
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,150
verification step in deploying something new.

376
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:59,559
So my, my guess and, and if someone knows, like I would,

377
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,390
I would love it if there was a pointer to what actually happened.

378
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:02,729
But

379
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:05,969
like, my suspicion is that

380
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,340
there was a verification step and it passed.

381
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,900
And what's interesting to me though is that they,

382
00:16:11,969 --> 00:16:14,210
they never considered it was a corrupt file because

383
00:16:14,219 --> 00:16:15,650
they passed it to the backup system and then,

384
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,340
you know, messed up the backup system.

385
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:20,099
They somehow thought it was an outage of the actual

386
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:25,299
system processing the file, not the file itself, sort of so to speak. It happens.

387
00:16:25,469 --> 00:16:27,539
Number one, you either have testing and it failed,

388
00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:31,150
which is bad or worse in a way you have no testing, which means like a YOLO,

389
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:33,599
like just feed it the file, hope it's all there, you know.

390
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,979
Um I'm always reminded of these instructions, like,

391
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:39,039
you know, run curl, blah, blah, blah, pipe it through bash.

392
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,890
And you know what I've never seen in any of these scripts

393
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:45,750
is a, is a check to make sure that the file downloaded completely

394
00:16:45,989 --> 00:16:47,489
and it's actually really easy to do.

395
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,169
There's a couple of easy ways to do it.

396
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:51,650
One is like you just basically define a function and then at the very end,

397
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:52,489
run the function,

398
00:16:52,619 --> 00:16:54,130
which means you got like the whole file,

399
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:59,330
a lot of the scripts do this where they extract the payload MD

400
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,299
five the payload and then they'll say if it's good or bad at

401
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,369
all,

402
00:17:03,469 --> 00:17:04,030
some do.

403
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,310
But anyways

404
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,640
and so like there's basic things you can do to make sure you

405
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,550
downloaded the whole file and then that the file is reasonably not corrupt.

406
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,118
Like at the GSD, we run it through a JSON parser and through a JSON schema parser to

407
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:18,800
make sure because Kurt has mangled the files and tried to check them in.

408
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:24,949
Now, now, here's the thing though. I run curl to bash,

409
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,069
not a lot, but it, it will say it, it's happened in the past.

410
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:31,630
And do you know how many times that has failed for me?

411
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,910
-- Oh, almost
-- never.

412
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:33,670
Never,

413
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:36,189
literally never. I can't think of a single time. It's failed. Right?

414
00:17:36,199 --> 00:17:39,849
-- But
-- if that bash file was controlling planes flying in the sky,

415
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:45,819
-- I, I might add that check
-- if that bash file failed and killed someone,

416
00:17:46,189 --> 00:17:47,469
I would be

417
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,219
much more vigilant

418
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:53,109
on what I was doing with it. Right. Versus,

419
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:56,619
and, and I think that's one of the things we often forget about is

420
00:17:57,349 --> 00:18:02,530
what we do in our work lives and personal lives generally don't

421
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,010
have to hold up to a lot of scrutiny because like,

422
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:09,219
even if you download a virus and, and you know, curl it to ash or whatever,

423
00:18:09,229 --> 00:18:11,209
is it really going to kill anyone?

424
00:18:11,219 --> 00:18:12,939
And the answer is often. No.

425
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,689
And so you just clean up the mess. Right.

426
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,579
And so I think that's one of the things is I,

427
00:18:17,589 --> 00:18:19,800
I love having conversation with the people where they're like, oh, well,

428
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:22,420
I can just do it like this, you know, they should have done this and it's like,

429
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,380
that's not how that works.

430
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:24,699
I mean,

431
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:29,339
one of my favorite examples is listening to industrial control system. People talk

432
00:18:29,869 --> 00:18:32,170
and like, I am not an industrial control system person.

433
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,050
I'm always like, why can't they just upgrade it?

434
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:37,000
And they're like, you don't understand how this works.

435
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,369
Like you have a machine that's 20 years old.

436
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,449
Like we don't even own the plugs to hook it up to a computer anymore.

437
00:18:43,459 --> 00:18:48,030
Like we cannot upgrade this even if we wanted to, which we don't

438
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,849
because it works.

439
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:50,859
It's fine.

440
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,699
Well, it's actually that's what my brother-in-law does.

441
00:18:52,709 --> 00:18:55,010
My, my sister and brother-in-law work in Ska

442
00:18:55,939 --> 00:18:57,829
and he specifically designs

443
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:01,910
the systems that like when the alarms go off, then what happens? Like, do we,

444
00:19:02,069 --> 00:19:06,719
do we turn this reactor vessel off? Do we turn the vent on? Do we turn this pipe off?

445
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:10,000
Do we open it up all the way? Do we, you know, like what ha basically what do we do

446
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,849
to create the most safe environment?

447
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,489
And it's complicated because these are like chemical

448
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,989
plants and oil and gas plants and like,

449
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,439
you know, like, oh, well, uh we want to vent this.

450
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,380
Ok. But if we vent this and it doesn't, like

451
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:21,560
something goes wrong.

452
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:22,180
Now, we have, you know,

453
00:19:22,189 --> 00:19:26,949
poisonous gas or explosive gas filling the plant that might actually be worse.

454
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:30,030
Right. Right. And that's the thing, like, when I make a mistake,

455
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:33,979
it doesn't really matter when your brother-in-law makes a mistake, people die,

456
00:19:33,989 --> 00:19:34,479
like,

457
00:19:34,699 --> 00:19:34,770
uh,

458
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,660
maybe cut that out of the show. But poor guy,

459
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,739
it's all good. Does he listen, you should tell him to listen to this.

460
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,589
Good Lord. No.

461
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:43,140
What's his

462
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:43,500
-- name?
-- You

463
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,140
-- can
-- say hi to him.

464
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,079
I'll let him have his privacy.

465
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,660
So one thing that's interesting to me is that

466
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:53,660
this also wasn't like it was a technical failure that resulted in a,

467
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,199
we're operating out of the bounds of what is

468
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,349
uh legally and regulator

469
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,469
allowed.

470
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,699
And so they granted all the planes they could have, you know, and, and they,

471
00:20:02,709 --> 00:20:03,699
the articles literally said,

472
00:20:03,709 --> 00:20:07,199
like we tried doing it verbally and just keep too much stuff and the system

473
00:20:07,209 --> 00:20:09,420
started falling apart because the air traffic controllers

474
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,209
have to route planes and not just read

475
00:20:11,326 --> 00:20:12,215
this giant list of no

476
00:20:12,385 --> 00:20:12,656
tams.

477
00:20:12,806 --> 00:20:14,586
Right. Right. Going back to this. So,

478
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:17,826
and then everybody's like, oh, it runs on spark and spark is obsolete and like blah,

479
00:20:17,836 --> 00:20:18,186
blah, blah.

480
00:20:18,196 --> 00:20:23,196
And it's like, well, yeah, because it was built right 1015, 20 years ago. And

481
00:20:23,946 --> 00:20:25,105
I think we covered this another show.

482
00:20:25,115 --> 00:20:26,265
But like, as long as it's running,

483
00:20:26,276 --> 00:20:28,946
why would we spend money upgrading it and making it better.

484
00:20:28,956 --> 00:20:30,725
And of course, now they're like, oh, there's a,

485
00:20:30,735 --> 00:20:33,776
there's going to be money to upgrade it ahead of schedule because apparently it was,

486
00:20:33,786 --> 00:20:34,745
it was slated for

487
00:20:34,852 --> 00:20:37,952
placement in six years. But here's the thing that gets me is like, yeah, the,

488
00:20:38,062 --> 00:20:40,212
like, replacing the hardware is probably a good idea because I,

489
00:20:40,222 --> 00:20:43,781
I don't know how easy it is to find spark replacement parts versus X 86.

490
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:44,832
You can go down to your local,

491
00:20:44,842 --> 00:20:50,031
whatever your local chain is and get like a really beefy computer for 1000 bucks.

492
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,612
What worries me is,

493
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:56,072
remember the articles Mozilla wrote about rewriting Netscape

494
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:58,302
to Fire Fox and how it almost killed them

495
00:20:58,569 --> 00:21:01,989
because you have all this institutional knowledge and all these corner cases that

496
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,050
you've successfully handled and they may or may not be properly documented.

497
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,390
And now you got to recreate a piece of software from scratch

498
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,829
-- that does all that properly.
-- They didn't recreate

499
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,099
Firefox from scratch though. Did they?

500
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:14,949
Well, not from scratch, but they rewrote it massively and it,

501
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:17,680
it ate up years of time and effort and it almost killed them.

502
00:21:17,689 --> 00:21:18,030
Right.

503
00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:21,989
And my concern here is, is, are they going to port the software

504
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:23,709
or are they going to rewrite it from scratch?

505
00:21:24,369 --> 00:21:25,790
I don't know. That's a good question

506
00:21:25,989 --> 00:21:27,939
because I suspect based on the fact that

507
00:21:27,949 --> 00:21:30,390
the FAA is saying contractors broke this thing.

508
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,800
Well, contractors bill hourly.

509
00:21:32,969 --> 00:21:36,550
-- Uh. Right.
-- Right. Well, contractors run a lot of those systems too.

510
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:41,270
-- So, contractors are probably gonna want to rewrite it from scratch
-- probably.

511
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,400
And, and it's hard to, I mean, so look,

512
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,680
this is always one of those things that I chuckle at

513
00:21:46,099 --> 00:21:47,810
and I mean, I know we talked about this, well,

514
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:49,729
we talked about curl a couple episodes ago

515
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:50,459
where

516
00:21:50,589 --> 00:21:53,869
curl supports all these weird corner cases and it's always easy to say, oh,

517
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,849
we'll just rewrite it.

518
00:21:55,329 --> 00:21:58,020
And this is almost certainly the same case where

519
00:21:58,089 --> 00:22:00,859
saying you're going to rewrite something sounds easy.

520
00:22:00,869 --> 00:22:02,410
But it really isn't. I mean,

521
00:22:02,849 --> 00:22:04,599
for anyone who's ever said, oh, we'll,

522
00:22:04,609 --> 00:22:07,040
we'll rewrite that and then they tried to rewrite it

523
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:10,599
and you realize the mistake you've made about halfway through

524
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,920
and then it's like, all right, what do we do now?

525
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:15,719
Do we turn back or do we keep plowing forward and deal with the mess we're making?

526
00:22:15,729 --> 00:22:18,599
And there's never a great answer for that because it's just,

527
00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:21,050
it's hard. Like when you have

528
00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:24,560
something that's critical to running your

529
00:22:24,699 --> 00:22:26,599
process or business or whatever,

530
00:22:27,199 --> 00:22:30,109
you, you can't just turn that off. Right. You need, you need it to run.

531
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:33,410
And if you write a new one, well, now the new one better not freaking screw up,

532
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,859
you know, because then people get mad.

533
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:38,869
Well, and again, this is a regulated requirement. This isn't like a nice to have or a

534
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:42,660
like you literally have to change the laws to not do this.

535
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:44,229
Change the law

536
00:22:44,979 --> 00:22:45,209
seems like

537
00:22:45,469 --> 00:22:45,500
I'm

538
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,199
saying, like, a business could,

539
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:47,969
like,

540
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:52,520
potentially do this, but this would require, like, an act of Congress. Which,

541
00:22:52,689 --> 00:22:53,839
yeah, that's not gonna happen

542
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,030
right

543
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:55,359
now.

544
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:55,890
So,

545
00:22:56,359 --> 00:23:00,780
the, the other thing I'm curious about is my fear would be is that they, they,

546
00:23:01,199 --> 00:23:03,410
one thing I've noticed with a lot of these systems that are,

547
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,349
especially 10 or 20 years old is not only do

548
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:06,880
they want to rewrite it but they want to like,

549
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,050
modernize it,

550
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:08,719
you know.

551
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,239
Yeah. Right. Let's, let's rewrite it in. No Js. That'd be great.

552
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:13,880
And uh you know,

553
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:18,329
or like use like Postgres SQL post GIS to make it geographically aware, you know,

554
00:23:18,339 --> 00:23:20,699
to make the data, geographically aware or whatever and like,

555
00:23:20,709 --> 00:23:22,000
nothing could go wrong there.

556
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,000
So

557
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,199
because in my mind,

558
00:23:24,209 --> 00:23:26,020
like it's one of those things where it sounds like a simple problem.

559
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,430
Ok, we have a bunch of notices, they're geographically distributed,

560
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:31,439
we need to tell people who need to know about them to know about them.

561
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:32,719
Right?

562
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:33,719
And

563
00:23:34,099 --> 00:23:36,810
the problem then becomes, is you have regulatory requirements like, oh,

564
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:39,410
it has to also be available in Spanish on Tuesdays at

565
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,569
5 p.m. because that's what the law says or whatever,

566
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:41,819
right?

567
00:23:41,829 --> 00:23:43,040
You have these crazy requirements.

568
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:47,030
I don't think there's gonna be like an ongoing series of outages like

569
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,439
this isn't the system failing and failing to work with kind of reality.

570
00:23:50,449 --> 00:23:52,010
Like it's not like, for example, they, you know,

571
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,800
there's a new place name with unicode character.

572
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,760
And that keeps us that's what's messing up the file,

573
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,119
right? Like it's not like there's more of that happening.

574
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,439
This isn't the kind of technical failure where it's,

575
00:24:00,459 --> 00:24:03,410
you just reminded me of something that I think is really important when

576
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:07,670
there are failures of this level in an organization like the FAA,

577
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:13,290
one of the things the FAA is phenomenal at is doing post mortems on things happening.

578
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:17,780
And so I guarantee they're going to know exactly how this happened and they're

579
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:22,890
going to create process and procedure to ensure this thing never happens again.

580
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,890
Now, variants of it could happen, of course, but

581
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,939
exactly what happened here will never happen again

582
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:33,560
because they're going to make a huge to do out of this, which is really cool. I mean,

583
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,050
I would love to say I always do a postmortem

584
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,920
when there's some sort of incident and I do,

585
00:24:39,469 --> 00:24:39,560
but

586
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,979
we'll say

587
00:24:41,209 --> 00:24:44,810
the follow-through isn't always as complete as I

588
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:46,839
would like for a variety of reasons,

589
00:24:46,849 --> 00:24:49,329
but the FAA is definitely going to get this one.

590
00:24:49,339 --> 00:24:52,239
-- Right.
-- Well, I, I don't know because the the correct answer here is this

591
00:24:52,515 --> 00:24:54,234
needs to be properly funded and maintained.

592
00:24:54,574 --> 00:24:56,035
Well, I mean, yes,

593
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:57,795
and that's not up to the FAA.

594
00:24:57,994 --> 00:24:59,385
That is a different problem.

595
00:24:59,395 --> 00:24:59,584
I mean,

596
00:24:59,594 --> 00:25:04,005
this specific narrow failure will not happen again exactly the way

597
00:25:04,015 --> 00:25:08,125
it happened this time because they will obviously create some new process

598
00:25:08,244 --> 00:25:12,525
on their checklist. Of a million things you have to do to deploy an update

599
00:25:12,685 --> 00:25:17,155
that now says, you know, check this file name or, or check this thing or whatever.

600
00:25:17,244 --> 00:25:19,275
Make sure there's no, oh, I've run into, um,

601
00:25:19,739 --> 00:25:24,319
uh, youtube file names have dashes in them which some specifically windows

602
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,550
subsystem for Linux gets confused about sometimes, like, if you try,

603
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:29,729
if you ellis in the dirt

604
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,219
it, like, gets confused.

605
00:25:31,349 --> 00:25:33,589
Yeah, it's pretty, it's, it's only windows

606
00:25:33,719 --> 00:25:34,359
subsystem for Linux.

607
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:36,810
I need to look at this. Now.

608
00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:40,430
I've never, I've never seen that, but I don't, I don't use it very often. I basically,

609
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,880
so it's actually funny.

610
00:25:42,329 --> 00:25:45,719
I realized the other day I was talking to someone who is basically saying,

611
00:25:45,729 --> 00:25:48,420
I'm trying to find an SSH client for my ipad.

612
00:25:48,579 --> 00:25:49,760
And I said, good luck.

613
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:53,040
I, I found one, I found one, there's one, it's awesome.

614
00:25:53,189 --> 00:25:55,920
So there's this thing called ish ish

615
00:25:56,109 --> 00:26:01,239
that is like an alpine virtualization layer or something that runs on I OS.

616
00:26:01,609 --> 00:26:05,680
And it basically gives you an alpine system all I want it for SSH, right?

617
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:06,880
And that's all he wanted it for.

618
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,640
And anyway, I, I, during this conversation,

619
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:10,650
I realized like I,

620
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,579
this is exactly what I want and I literally only want ssh

621
00:26:13,589 --> 00:26:15,530
this if you're listening and you own an I OS device,

622
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,130
like install ish ish.

623
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:17,979
It's amazing.

624
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:21,739
I will say support is maybe questionable. It hasn't been updated in almost a year.

625
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:26,030
So like I, I pray it doesn't die. But I realize like my windows subsystem for Linux

626
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,560
I have on my Windows machine. I mean,

627
00:26:27,829 --> 00:26:31,920
I literally only use it for SSH, that is the only thing I do with it.

628
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,900
And it amused me when I realized that.

629
00:26:34,449 --> 00:26:37,579
No, I mean, now that I've actually got a server up and running again, I've got a true N

630
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,920
scale box running containers. I'm not running as many workload.

631
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:43,000
Like I'm doing testing on my work, my windows machine,

632
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:45,369
but I'm not running actual workloads there anymore.

633
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:49,880
So, so, so anyway, it's no, but I think the challenge is

634
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:53,869
there's also something to be said for. We defined a requirement.

635
00:26:53,949 --> 00:26:56,640
We built a piece of software in a system that meets that requirement

636
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,869
and it's been running for 10 or 20 years

637
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:02,349
and we just leave it alone and kind of keep it on life support

638
00:27:02,469 --> 00:27:03,319
and we're, you know,

639
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:07,400
some things don't need to be constantly extended and changed and upgraded,

640
00:27:07,849 --> 00:27:08,979
which is not to say

641
00:27:09,219 --> 00:27:13,219
there's not value in that, like uh E 911 is a great example, right? The, the fact that

642
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:17,619
basically, I think right now we're pretty in the next year or two,

643
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:19,920
pretty much every phone now is doing E 911.

644
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,430
So when you call 911,

645
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,619
the phone's like, hell, I'm over here,

646
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:24,619
right?

647
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:28,420
And that's hugely valuable for 911 operators to know like where on earth are you,

648
00:27:28,739 --> 00:27:30,989
you know, because we can't really help you if you don't know where you are.

649
00:27:32,089 --> 00:27:34,729
And my understanding is that pretty much all the phones do it now.

650
00:27:34,739 --> 00:27:37,420
It's just now also we need to get the 911

651
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:38,630
centers

652
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:39,979
to support

653
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:40,579
it, right.

654
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:43,930
You know, and there's also talk of like 911 supporting texting and, you know,

655
00:27:43,939 --> 00:27:47,449
multimedia because like every time I've had an interaction, I'm always like,

656
00:27:47,619 --> 00:27:50,069
or with the, especially with the city for 311, I'm like,

657
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:53,349
it's great now because they have an app and you can attach photos and video to the app.

658
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,400
-- All right,
-- I'm stopping you there because I, I know where this inevitably goes,

659
00:27:56,699 --> 00:27:59,079
which is the ban topic of potholes.

660
00:27:59,290 --> 00:27:59,510
But,

661
00:28:00,849 --> 00:28:02,199
but what I'm saying is there's, there's,

662
00:28:02,209 --> 00:28:04,760
I think a lot of people forget that there's a real value in

663
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:07,920
having a boring stable system on life support that works for 20 years.

664
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,079
So here's what I'm thinking of as you're describing.

665
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:14,160
This is we'll, we'll, we'll pick on no damn in this instance. Is,

666
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:17,280
is it acceptable to have a,

667
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:18,140
a

668
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:20,599
software based system

669
00:28:20,859 --> 00:28:21,550
that

670
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,410
you are willing to say this is complete and can continue running the way it is

671
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:29,709
-- in perpetuity.
-- Well, as long as the regulations don't change,

672
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:32,260
well, well, ignore, let's, let's say they don't

673
00:28:32,849 --> 00:28:36,060
like a good example is you can go to,

674
00:28:36,609 --> 00:28:40,910
we'll say certain, let's say factories or, or factories are a good one because when,

675
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,800
when I was in college.

676
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,310
I worked in a paper mill in the summers to

677
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:45,270
earn money to pay for room and board and stuff.

678
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,750
And we had a paper machine there that was

679
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:49,949
100 years old and it was the only paper machine

680
00:28:50,199 --> 00:28:53,099
the company had that could make a very certain kind of paper.

681
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:54,750
And that's why they kept it running

682
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,229
and of course, it had weird maintenance issues and stuff.

683
00:28:57,239 --> 00:29:00,189
But functionally like it ran, we ran it,

684
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:02,609
it had received minimal upgrades over the years.

685
00:29:02,619 --> 00:29:06,229
So, like it was, it was a pretty old machine but it, it did its job. Right.

686
00:29:06,569 --> 00:29:06,819
Yeah,

687
00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:08,979
but that's a very mechanical thing.

688
00:29:08,989 --> 00:29:13,359
Like you can say, I need a new bolt for this and it's a weird bolt,

689
00:29:13,369 --> 00:29:14,420
machinist will make it.

690
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,420
Versus when we think about tech,

691
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,079
you can't, like, like, let's say you have a spark chip that's not made in it.

692
00:29:20,089 --> 00:29:22,959
You can't, like, hire someone to make you that spark chip.

693
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,000
You can't,

694
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,520
you can't upgrade some of these libraries.

695
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,880
They might not even have source code for some of this stuff anymore.

696
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:29,800
Like, I don't know.

697
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:33,209
Oh, they absolutely, that stuff's going, like, unless it's archived somewhere,

698
00:29:33,219 --> 00:29:35,319
it's going slowly bit rotting away.

699
00:29:35,329 --> 00:29:37,689
-- I feel
-- like tech is kind of different. Whereas

700
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:42,219
historically, a lot of the things we have that are really old, I mean,

701
00:29:42,229 --> 00:29:44,400
I live in 100 year old house, you know,

702
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,910
you can generally

703
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:51,680
work around a lot of this stuff. But I feel like in, in software and computers, like

704
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,760
you really, you kind of can't,

705
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,400
-- you know.
-- Well, let's talk about light bulbs for a second in theory.

706
00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:01,000
Like I, there's this youtube, uh, person who makes vacuum valves from scratch.

707
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:03,079
It's, it's a beautiful, amazing process.

708
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,660
Oh, I need, send, send me that link. I'll put it in the show notes.

709
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,400
But that sounds like it's right up my alley.

710
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,140
It is.

711
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:11,560
So it's, yeah, it's, and it's, you know, he's got this little vacuum pumps, like,

712
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,619
you know, sucking out the air and everything.

713
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,400
It's just so pretty because he's like cutting it

714
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:17,489
with tin snips and like he's eyeballing it and

715
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:22,339
makes working vacuum tubes. So, in my house, I have light bulbs and, well,

716
00:30:22,449 --> 00:30:23,310
but even, well,

717
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:26,430
the CFC si I certainly can't build like the incandescent light

718
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,859
bulbs I could in theory make on my own with,

719
00:30:29,069 --> 00:30:32,180
I need a vacuum pump, some glassblowing stuff and like over the wire.

720
00:30:32,459 --> 00:30:33,739
-- Sure. I'm
-- pretty sure

721
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,599
my hue light bulbs, I cannot recreate. Uh

722
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,430
No, absolutely not.

723
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:41,819
In fact, I took one apart one day I had a failed B I contact Phillips.

724
00:30:41,829 --> 00:30:43,430
They sent me a new one and I'm like, do you want the old one?

725
00:30:43,439 --> 00:30:44,290
And they were like, nope, throw it.

726
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:46,979
So I thought I'm taking this part. Right. I'm going to look inside of it.

727
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,699
What is it like an ESP 32 or something in there?

728
00:30:49,819 --> 00:30:53,390
No, it had some, it was a pretty good processor. I think it was an arm chip.

729
00:30:53,459 --> 00:30:56,319
You know what Phillips does make chips. That would not surprise me.

730
00:30:56,329 --> 00:30:59,800
It's all encased in resonance stuff. You can't even really work on it. Right.

731
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:00,359
It's like,

732
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,829
or actually a better example.

733
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:04,760
So I'm, I'm helping out that robotics team at the high school. Right.

734
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:05,680
And

735
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:09,839
they had a board with a broken USB port on it. I'm like, I will buy a new USB port.

736
00:31:09,849 --> 00:31:10,869
I will solder it on.

737
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:14,729
And they had, they had the boards, it wasn't the kind of resin we're used to.

738
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:17,130
It's some sort of other coding but it was enough that, like,

739
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,750
it really got in the way of soldering the piece on and it was

740
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,930
-- all
-- the conformal coding stuff. Yeah.

741
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:25,119
Yeah, it was horrible to get. I mean, I got the old one, I got the new one on.

742
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,189
It still didn't work.

743
00:31:26,199 --> 00:31:27,900
So I'm like, whatever, it doesn't matter, we just,

744
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:30,989
we can live without it because there's other ways to connect to the board and stuff.

745
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,150
But I'm like, uh, because you can do it over the network. But, but anyway,

746
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:39,140
it, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It, it's one of those things, like, a lot of this tech is

747
00:31:39,349 --> 00:31:44,270
even if you have a, a, an abnormal level of skill, which I'm not gonna say I'm like,

748
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,260
Ben Heck or anything.

749
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,459
But, like, I'm definitely,

750
00:31:46,939 --> 00:31:50,880
I've done enough work on boards that I can fix most things

751
00:31:51,449 --> 00:31:52,819
and like a Phillips hue.

752
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:55,839
No, I guarantee I can't touch that and do anything useful on it.

753
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,050
Like, I mean, I'm guessing there's some cut off point, like,

754
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,319
probably about mid eighties, late eighties where

755
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:04,040
you could absolutely take that chip figure, kind of out how it works

756
00:32:04,329 --> 00:32:06,959
and get somebody to produce it. But a spark chip.

757
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:10,329
-- No, too many, like the trend, like, too small,
-- sort of, sort of. Ok.

758
00:32:10,339 --> 00:32:12,920
So here's something to think about and I'm gonna end on this because we're,

759
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,000
we're running ourselves out of time.

760
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:14,550
But now

761
00:32:15,089 --> 00:32:16,400
I love watching

762
00:32:16,969 --> 00:32:19,569
old hardware repair videos on the internet because then I

763
00:32:19,579 --> 00:32:20,949
don't have to buy this stuff and fix it.

764
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:24,229
I can, I gain my joy from watching others. I know. Right.

765
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:24,750
And,

766
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,359
and what's funny is I have all the gear in my

767
00:32:26,369 --> 00:32:28,630
basement because every time I see them use a tool,

768
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,849
I'm like, oh, I want one of those and then I buy it and I'm like, well,

769
00:32:30,859 --> 00:32:32,750
I've never used this because I never will.

770
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,800
But anyway, that's another story.

771
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,410
But

772
00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:35,959
anyway,

773
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:38,579
the Commodore 64 is one of my favorite examples

774
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:42,479
where Commodore had created some Commodore specific chips.

775
00:32:42,489 --> 00:32:44,119
And one of them is called the SID chip,

776
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:47,979
which is their like sound chip where they do all the sound processing and stuff,

777
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:50,930
you can buy new SID chips.

778
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,689
And there's kind of two variants of this,

779
00:32:52,699 --> 00:32:56,114
there's one where people have literally like gotten a chip made.

780
00:32:56,125 --> 00:33:00,354
That is a chip you plug in, that is a new C, it's not as good as the old.

781
00:33:00,364 --> 00:33:04,265
It's not perfect but it's good enough. And then there's people, they've taken F PGA S

782
00:33:04,405 --> 00:33:08,494
program, the F PGA put it on a board. Like the board is kind of big and honky. But

783
00:33:08,645 --> 00:33:10,964
you plug it in and now you have a sit

784
00:33:11,354 --> 00:33:12,175
and so

785
00:33:12,589 --> 00:33:16,780
in the case of something like a spark, could you do that? Maybe, maybe not.

786
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:19,750
Would it, would I trust that to keep my airplane from falling out of the sky?

787
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,839
Absolutely not.

788
00:33:20,849 --> 00:33:23,920
But it's one of those things that in 20 or 30 years,

789
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:27,500
the things we think are impossible may not be impossible anymore.

790
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,329
Well, fun fact.

791
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:28,819
I mean,

792
00:33:28,829 --> 00:33:32,290
uh Boeing 74 sevens and whatnot still take software updates from floppy disk.

793
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,020
And so now they have these USB floppy disk adapter do hickeys.

794
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:38,619
Right. Right. Exactly. Exactly. Anyway. All right. All right.

795
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,170
I'm gonna, I,

796
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,829
I guess I'll give you the last word on this

797
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:43,160
one because I can't think of anything particularly insightful.

798
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,329
I suspect

799
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,709
a lot of these old systems that are running

800
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:51,469
are a lot more robust and fragile

801
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,130
than we think. And I think the challenge is,

802
00:33:54,329 --> 00:33:59,189
no, no, I think the challenge is the things, the fragility we often miss.

803
00:33:59,199 --> 00:34:02,040
Like we, we kind of get the obvious ones like, oh, what if the spark hardware dies?

804
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,089
Where do you get a spare machine

805
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,750
ebay versus, you know?

806
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:04,859
Oh,

807
00:34:04,869 --> 00:34:07,180
like because it's been eating these files for 20 years and

808
00:34:07,189 --> 00:34:10,629
never fell over until yesterday or two days ago or whatever.

809
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:14,089
Yeah. Whoops. Maybe we should check more for that.

810
00:34:14,768 --> 00:34:15,447
All right.
