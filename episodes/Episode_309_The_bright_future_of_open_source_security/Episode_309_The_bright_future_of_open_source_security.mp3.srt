Hello and welcome to the open source Security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:11,489
Kurt Siefried and my partner and being tired of winter.

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,149
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,319 --> 00:00:16,068
-- I
-- mean, look, I'm tired of winter, but that's not why I'm actually tired right now.

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,549
The ravages of old age are why I'm tired right now.

5
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:23,750
So I, I woke up the other day and I couldn't turn my neck because

6
00:00:23,979 --> 00:00:24,899
did you try a new pillow?

7
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:25,469
No.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,360
No, that's the thing. Like, I just went to sleep, woke up, couldn't turn my neck neck.

9
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:29,629
Really

10
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:32,200
took a bunch of medicine. I just did. I'm just old.

11
00:00:32,209 --> 00:00:34,150
Of course, my Children laugh at me all that.

12
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:37,520
But then I didn't sleep very well last night because my neck hurts and,

13
00:00:37,529 --> 00:00:40,580
like I can turn my head now, but I'm still tired and

14
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:43,020
it's like, well, that's my life now.

15
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:46,139
Yeah, that's my favorite thing is just those random days where it's like, ok, I,

16
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,119
I can't really shoulder check very easily.

17
00:00:48,279 --> 00:00:48,540
Right.

18
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:51,159
Yeah, there's no good reason for this. It's just,

19
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,360
I'm old and who knows, whatever.

20
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:54,880
Yeah,

21
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:56,380
pretty much.

22
00:00:56,909 --> 00:00:57,659
That's just,

23
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,900
you know, what gets me is so we spend,

24
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:02,180
or we're supposed to spend about a third of our life sleeping

25
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:05,629
and there's no like legitimate service or

26
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,230
kind of consultant I can hire to actually take a bunch of measurements for me.

27
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:13,720
-- And, you know, this is the kind of pillow you need to sleep. Well, I
-- mean,

28
00:01:14,059 --> 00:01:15,169
-- I guess
-- like,

29
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,300
would you trust a pillow salesman to have your best interests in

30
00:01:17,309 --> 00:01:19,120
mind or to try and sell you the most expensive pillow?

31
00:01:19,199 --> 00:01:21,580
That sounds scary to me. What is, what is it?

32
00:01:21,589 --> 00:01:23,620
Is a pillow salesman gonna watch me sleep?

33
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:24,300
-- Well, I
-- don't

34
00:01:24,309 --> 00:01:24,660
know, like

35
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:25,019
comb

36
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,089
your hair while you're asleep. Like what happens here?

37
00:01:27,099 --> 00:01:29,059
-- This
-- is like most companies and large orgs, you know,

38
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:31,419
you have like an ergonomic office assessment where they,

39
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,989
they make sure your chair is not, you know,

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,309
all wonky in your desk because it at the right height and stuff.

41
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:35,650
Right.

42
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,279
So, why don't we do that for sleep?

43
00:01:39,379 --> 00:01:42,040
Because no one wants to pay for it.

44
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,169
But the funny thing is like

45
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:47,089
to go off on a tangent, but the whole mattress market now is like,

46
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:48,599
it used to be $1000 mattress was.

47
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,150
Wow, that's high end. And now it's like, that's entry level.

48
00:01:51,339 --> 00:01:54,040
But, um, people will pay a lot of money for a good night's sleep.

49
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:57,720
But it's weird to me that I can't hire, like, like, if I wanna,

50
00:01:58,139 --> 00:02:02,080
I can, I can hire somebody to survey my property and to do like a ground, you know, uh,

51
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:04,500
of the water runoff analysis and be like, ok, Kurt, you know,

52
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,319
you need to slope this more and like, put a drainage ditch over there,

53
00:02:07,889 --> 00:02:08,279
right?

54
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:10,119
Or I can hire a mechanic to look at my car and be like, oh,

55
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,679
your car is in good shape but it could use new brakes or, you know,

56
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:15,880
I can hire all sorts of people to look at how I cook

57
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:18,199
or all these other things and improve and help me improve it.

58
00:02:18,369 --> 00:02:19,350
But not my sleep.

59
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,110
I'm certain

60
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,320
there's somebody you can find on the internet

61
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,820
that will do exactly what you're looking to do.

62
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:28,949
But I, I,

63
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,449
I'm going to tie this back to security

64
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,899
because it's actually related to some conversations I've

65
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:37,660
been having lately and I think it's something for all of us to think about is

66
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,830
so we talk about something like wanting to sleep better and we're,

67
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,910
we would all say yes, I want to sleep better. Who doesn't? Right?

68
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:44,690
But

69
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,639
it's one of those things that

70
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,020
when you tell people, ok,

71
00:02:48,089 --> 00:02:51,729
you will sleep better if you pay this person to do something.

72
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,270
And then it's like, wait a minute, I don't want to pay that.

73
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,320
So I'll be, uh, whatever I'll, I'll be fine.

74
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:00,419
And this reminds me of certain security,

75
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:02,820
we'll say requirements where people are always saying, oh,

76
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,399
I want to sign all my emails.

77
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,320
I want to sign all the S bombs, you know what I mean?

78
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,710
And, and like, I think signatures are a really easy one or people will say, oh,

79
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,960
I want to keep all my dependencies updated or

80
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,570
I wanna run all my code through the, the static analyzer tool.

81
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:19,550
And it sounds like a good idea

82
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:21,350
until you get the bill.

83
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,289
And then it's like, uh I'm probably OK the way it is now,

84
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:29,470
the other problem is, does it actually work and do what you want?

85
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:31,940
-- And
-- some of it does, some of it doesn't and I agree

86
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:32,250
with that,

87
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:34,110
but you don't find out until after you pay the bill

88
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:37,300
and, and I think sleep, like, having some sort of sleep,

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,979
a consultant. I don't have to call them

90
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,089
would be a similar thing of,

91
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:47,130
I could pay this person and maybe it would be better and maybe it wouldn't,

92
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:49,039
I don't really know, you know what I mean?

93
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,369
Like, there are sleep clinics locally but they're for people, you know,

94
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,289
with sleep apnea and, like severe problems.

95
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,610
Like, I'm, I'm sleeping ok.

96
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,610
-- I just want to sleep better.
-- I just don't want my neck to hurt.

97
00:04:00,619 --> 00:04:02,570
-- Yeah,
-- I wanna wake up without, you know,

98
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:05,289
without movement, hurting everywhere.

99
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:09,669
-- But,
-- uh, anyway, anyway, whatever, whatever. Let's, let's

100
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,169
what are we talking about

101
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:11,490
today?

102
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,750
Well, I think the big thing is, uh,

103
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:17,519
I really like this N PM forcing two factor authentication on the top 100 projects.

104
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,779
And I love it for two reasons. One because it's absolutely the right thing to do.

105
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:25,450
Not just in the sense of forcing two fa on the top 100 projects. But

106
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,920
doing it only the top 100 projects to start.

107
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:28,670
Yeah, because

108
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,859
you got to start somewhere. So, yeah, exactly.

109
00:04:30,869 --> 00:04:32,559
And so because all these people on Twitter are like,

110
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:36,359
why aren't you doing it for the top 500 or the 101st, or the top 1000 or everybody?

111
00:04:36,369 --> 00:04:36,910
And it's kind of like,

112
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:38,480
do you bite and chew your food?

113
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,459
I, because I hope you do.

114
00:04:40,619 --> 00:04:44,670
If, if you like, if you eat hot dogs like the Japanese hot dog champion, then, ok,

115
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:48,559
maybe you want to just turn on to a a for everybody all at once and see what happens.

116
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,709
But trust me when and Josh, when we say

117
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:55,989
-- that's not gonna work
-- well. So what, what happens

118
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,350
is when you do something like enabling two factor authentication,

119
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,940
80% of the people are going to have no trouble.

120
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,279
10% of the people are going to not be able to

121
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,910
get it to work for some bizarre edge case reason.

122
00:05:06,989 --> 00:05:09,109
1% of the people are going to forget their

123
00:05:09,119 --> 00:05:11,829
password or lose their phone or something immediately.

124
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,500
I'll never forget that when,

125
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:18,040
when we were at, at Red Hat, Red Hat acquired two factor

126
00:05:18,149 --> 00:05:18,579
A for L

127
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,519
and this is back in the Rs A key days

128
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:25,209
and someone lost their token two hours after they got it. And it's like,

129
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,329
-- that's impressive.
-- I remember being at an event

130
00:05:30,059 --> 00:05:31,369
and there was an ebay engineer.

131
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,959
And the ebay engineer saw that I had,

132
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,529
I actually at this point had multiple two of a tokens on my

133
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,079
keychain because I had one for ebay and I had one for Blizzard.

134
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:43,029
And they were super impressed that not only do I have an RS a token on my key chain,

135
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,630
but I had two of them and they're like, what are they for?

136
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,609
And I'm like, oh, it's like this one was actually for ebay.

137
00:05:46,619 --> 00:05:49,290
Like I use it with you guys and this engineer replied,

138
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,209
oh, yeah, I tried it, but it was too much hassle.

139
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,010
I couldn't get off the couch so I just disabled it

140
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,730
and you know what that,

141
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,750
-- but that's how it works. It
-- is, if you don't force people to do certain things,

142
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,029
they will find a million excuses.

143
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,309
My other favorite was when everyone was starting to get the RS a tokens,

144
00:06:07,609 --> 00:06:10,649
they set up a webcam pointed at their Rs a token.

145
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,630
-- So no matter where they were, they could get a hold of the token and then type
-- it in.

146
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,170
-- They solved the problem. It's
-- like, well, I guess

147
00:06:19,739 --> 00:06:20,470
so.

148
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,709
So the other thing is too is you gotta like,

149
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,790
it's, it's not just going to be, you know,

150
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:27,880
it's funny that you say 10% will have edge cases.

151
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:28,450
Well, no offense.

152
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:32,059
If 10% of people have edge cases, they're not really edge cases anymore. They're

153
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:38,730
-- much more common than
-- we would be maybe so whatever. But the point is 10% of 100 people

154
00:06:38,869 --> 00:06:41,540
is a lot different than 10% of a million people.

155
00:06:42,299 --> 00:06:44,869
So I clicked on the two fa set up in uh N PM.

156
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,399
So what's interesting is it doesn't force you to

157
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,489
set up two fa when you create an account because

158
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,140
-- you're
-- not one of the top

159
00:06:50,549 --> 00:06:51,609
project.

160
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,540
Um It encourages you to, it displays a warning label. So I clicked on it.

161
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:56,769
So

162
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,100
what I like is they actually give you

163
00:06:59,309 --> 00:07:01,170
like here's what you have to do. So it doesn't break stuff.

164
00:07:01,179 --> 00:07:04,850
So prerequisites update your M PM client to version 5.5 0.1 or higher.

165
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:06,109
OK. That's good to know,

166
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:10,790
right? Because II, I don't know what version of N PM supports this or not. OK.

167
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:12,059
And then number two,

168
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,869
install an authentic application that can generate one time passwords.

169
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,410
So they're using OTP one time passwords and they're

170
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,730
using the standard because they then say use off

171
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,000
the Google authenticator or Microsoft authenticator.

172
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,519
I would also assume open

173
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,760
o also works, which is weird that they don't link to that but whatever

174
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:29,950
on a mobile device or second computer that will always

175
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:32,010
be available when you work on your N PM account.

176
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,859
So yeah, like it, it has to be available

177
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:36,239
and then

178
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,920
uh through the web, they give a bunch of screenshots on how to turn it on.

179
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:44,380
Also, you can selectively you can have it only for authorization.

180
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:49,019
So it says for example, logging into N PM js.com or through the command line

181
00:07:49,489 --> 00:07:52,640
and, or authorization and publishing.

182
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,750
So you can have it set.

183
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,510
So you just log in like basically you can secure your account with it

184
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,489
or you can secure your account and publishing of software with it,

185
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,660
which I think is really nice distinction to make.

186
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,959
Yeah, because for example,

187
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:05,640
on github,

188
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,920
I have two F eight but I don't do sign commits because it's too much hassle.

189
00:08:09,179 --> 00:08:10,239
Sure. Sure.

190
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:16,600
Now I will say if you're protecting your publishing rights with an A a token,

191
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,220
you can't do kind of automated pushes

192
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,070
is going to be the downfall to that.

193
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:24,100
Well, not without your webcam hooked up to the thing

194
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:24,769
that

195
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:25,739
OCR

196
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,790
Right. Right. Which

197
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:35,270
I, I think this is one of those places as more and more people are using this service.

198
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,150
I think they can

199
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,400
refine what the permissions need to look like because there

200
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:42,669
are N PM developers that kind of one off put,

201
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,770
it's all very manual and that's just fine.

202
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,760
And then there's also developers that it's click a button

203
00:08:47,979 --> 00:08:49,419
and the machine starts

204
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:52,340
and your, your published package comes out the other side.

205
00:08:52,349 --> 00:08:54,320
And obviously, in that case, you don't want a human,

206
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,820
you know, typing in six digits because now they're the bottleneck.

207
00:08:58,219 --> 00:09:02,400
Well, or, and that's, this is one of the biggest problems I find is so I like sites

208
00:09:02,849 --> 00:09:06,969
that allow software tokens and hardware tokens. But I'm always afraid of sites

209
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,239
that only allow you to register one

210
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,640
software or hardware token because what if your phone gets lost or you,

211
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,880
you physically lose your token?

212
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:14,679
Yeah,

213
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:19,979
totally. And so I'm noticing more and more are allowing multiple tokens, right?

214
00:09:19,989 --> 00:09:21,260
And sometimes they, you know,

215
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,119
explicitly allow it and sometimes you kind of have to discover it.

216
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,049
But for example, github,

217
00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:29,349
Google, you know, they all support multiple tokens really well. And so I have

218
00:09:29,825 --> 00:09:33,294
the one in my safe deposit box register, which is a pain because I have to go get it,

219
00:09:33,304 --> 00:09:34,885
register it, take it back to the bank.

220
00:09:35,025 --> 00:09:37,335
But you know, if my house burns down man, this is going to be awkward.

221
00:09:37,804 --> 00:09:41,575
No, absolutely. I'm, I'm in the exact same boat. II,

222
00:09:41,804 --> 00:09:43,094
I have two

223
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:44,575
hardware tokens

224
00:09:44,905 --> 00:09:49,015
that I use. I have a UB key and a Google Titan key. I generally register them both.

225
00:09:49,025 --> 00:09:54,174
One stays at my desk and the other I carry with me. And then I also often if I can,

226
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,659
I'll set up the Google Authenticator app because you're right.

227
00:09:56,669 --> 00:09:59,820
If you lose a device, if my phone falls in the river or whatever,

228
00:10:00,229 --> 00:10:02,320
I don't want to be, you know, sol

229
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:03,049
and,

230
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:05,809
and that's one of the things that scares me to death because a

231
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,400
lot of these services are quite explicit that if you lose your key,

232
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,590
there's nothing we can do because we don't care about you.

233
00:10:12,789 --> 00:10:15,570
Well, and see this, this is one of those classic things where

234
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,799
like if it fails for you, 1% of the time,

235
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,250
it's annoying but whatever. But if it's like dead for you, then

236
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,369
that's a problem.

237
00:10:22,859 --> 00:10:26,330
And so the other thing, here's the biggest problem I have with TU of A

238
00:10:26,869 --> 00:10:28,099
is a lot of sites do good.

239
00:10:28,109 --> 00:10:31,830
Two fa you know, no longer S MS because S MS is garbage, got to stop doing that.

240
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,479
But like they do tokens, they support the software blah, blah blah.

241
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,780
But then account recovery is just

242
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:38,809
email access

243
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,539
and I get it because it's tough because

244
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,460
well, what else? What

245
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,380
you can't really add anything else to it and still have it be account recovery

246
00:10:47,789 --> 00:10:49,710
because people aren't going to remember that stuff.

247
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:50,739
Um

248
00:10:50,979 --> 00:10:52,239
Like a great example is my bank.

249
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,510
I accidentally, I logged into my bank and it asked me, you know,

250
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,760
my one of my security questions that I

251
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,340
accidentally put in the wrong answer three times.

252
00:10:57,349 --> 00:10:58,260
So it like locked me out

253
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,140
and then it was like trying to ask me essentially security

254
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,380
questions of like which of these transactions did you make?

255
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,380
And one of them was like an example transaction for 83

256
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,780
cents at Costco and for anybody that shops at Costco,

257
00:11:07,789 --> 00:11:09,190
you know that there's no such thing as,

258
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:09,599
oh

259
00:11:09,729 --> 00:11:13,000
wait, there is I bought a pop. Oh damn it. That's why I got it wrong.

260
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,909
Oh I just see. This is a perfect example. So,

261
00:11:17,729 --> 00:11:20,239
so I got locked out of my bank account and I had to phone them

262
00:11:20,469 --> 00:11:24,969
and the lady is like, you know, your, your, the last digits of your sin or whatever,

263
00:11:24,979 --> 00:11:25,739
whatever, whatever.

264
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,190
And, but it's like I was like, if she asked me any of my transaction questions.

265
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:32,830
Well, I don't know because I don't have access to my online banking.

266
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,349
Right.

267
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:34,710
Right. Like, and,

268
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,859
and like just now I literally was like when

269
00:11:36,869 --> 00:11:38,710
I saw that 80 some cent transaction at Costco,

270
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:39,669
I was like, no, I didn't make that.

271
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:42,510
That's, that's not even can you even buy something at Costco? 43 cents?

272
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:43,159
It's like

273
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:46,119
a pop. I forgot about like I bought a pop there.

274
00:11:47,349 --> 00:11:48,049
I love it.

275
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:50,830
Ah Anyway, so, so this kind of proves my point

276
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:54,500
is that when it comes to account recovery, you basically have to support what I call

277
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:58,010
the naked homeless person scenario, which is literally a naked homeless person.

278
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,450
It's like I need access to my account

279
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,190
and I don't remember who I am basically.

280
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,630
So like help me out.

281
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,510
Well, because apparently I qualify for that scenario as of yesterday

282
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:11,479
and that's the thing.

283
00:12:11,489 --> 00:12:15,390
So it can't really be much past email and it, so my email is very secure.

284
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,119
I actually have Google advanced account protection enabled, right?

285
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:21,320
Which is if anybody uses it, you know how much of a chore it is to log in and stuff.

286
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:23,719
But for the majority of people,

287
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,719
it's probably a weak link but from the providers point of view, what else can they do

288
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:28,719
reasonably?

289
00:12:29,479 --> 00:12:30,159
Exactly.

290
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,679
There's nothing they can do.

291
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,450
One thing I would love to see is more account recovery, not just via email,

292
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,190
but for example, via a Facebook or linkedin or Twitter account.

293
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,119
So again, you know, people have a bit more choice,

294
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:45,940
I mean, but you still run into the issue of if someone takes over my Facebook account,

295
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,070
now they can

296
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:50,750
conduct an account recovery on my behalf.

297
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:54,409
But what's interesting is things like Facebook have other ways to secure

298
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:57,049
accounts that email doesn't have like they have the social graph,

299
00:12:57,059 --> 00:12:58,200
they have pictures of you.

300
00:12:58,359 --> 00:13:01,219
You know, I'm always reminded of that Instagram account recovery process where

301
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,299
Instagram generally has pictures of their users.

302
00:13:03,309 --> 00:13:06,219
And so they have you write like a six digit code on a piece of paper,

303
00:13:06,229 --> 00:13:07,590
take a picture and send it to them

304
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,510
to do account recovery because they have pictures of you.

305
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:14,000
Yeah, I mean, look, I'm not gonna start this conversation.

306
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:14,539
-- I
-- just, what I

307
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:18,190
-- think is I would like some choice. I would like some flexibility.
-- Ok.

308
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:18,869
Ok.

309
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,609
It, it

310
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,950
now at the same time,

311
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,099
I do think

312
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,460
things are better than they used to be

313
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,830
so we can at least agree on that. But

314
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:28,710
anyway,

315
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,669
I want to keep us moving because I don't want to just talk about this.

316
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,070
Well, and just one quick thing N PM does allow

317
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:36,989
email based account recovery.

318
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,809
So it doesn't matter how much to a a you do if your email account is insecure. So,

319
00:13:42,369 --> 00:13:43,349
-- so
-- there you go.

320
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:45,710
-- Obviously secure your email account, please.
-- Folks,

321
00:13:46,789 --> 00:13:52,210
I want to move on and talk about the Linux Foundation announced Alpha and Omega.

322
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,289
I don't know what that is

323
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,049
good.

324
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:56,289
This one's interesting and I'm, I, I

325
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,010
have many thoughts on this. So

326
00:13:59,219 --> 00:14:03,599
there's these two projects, the Linux Foundation's open SSF,

327
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:04,820
which is the open source

328
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,690
Security Foundation. David Wheeler was on

329
00:14:07,849 --> 00:14:10,539
at a couple of episodes ago talking about it. I'll put a link in the show notes. It

330
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:10,729
was

331
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:10,900
a

332
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:11,719
year ago.

333
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:12,710
What's that?

334
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,570
-- I think
-- it was actually quite some time ago.

335
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:19,150
No, it wasn't. I don't think it was, well, it was in 2021 but

336
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,390
I feel like it was in November maybe

337
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:22,390
October.

338
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,109
I don't know.

339
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:24,419
Anyway, doesn't matter.

340
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,390
So

341
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:28,030
there's these two projects they started and this is all on the

342
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:31,359
heels of log for Jay as these things tend to happen.

343
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,700
The idea behind alpha

344
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:37,070
is the Linux Foundation open SSF is going

345
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,700
to identify some of the critical open source projects

346
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,049
and then dedicate

347
00:14:42,219 --> 00:14:45,890
specifically like security funding and people to it.

348
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,640
So like having people go through the code and do security reviews and

349
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:52,159
help with vulnerabilities and all this stuff.

350
00:14:52,169 --> 00:14:55,359
And so it's meant to be kind of a very white glove service.

351
00:14:55,489 --> 00:14:57,299
They're pro I'm assuming they're actually probably going to

352
00:14:57,309 --> 00:14:59,510
start with making sure there are some code maintainers.

353
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:00,590
I mean,

354
00:15:01,049 --> 00:15:04,210
-- it's all part of it, it's all part of that.
-- Well, that's what I love is.

355
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,869
A lot of people make the assumption that these critical projects have

356
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:09,770
like people buying them

357
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,049
and in some cases like they don't.

358
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:16,969
Well, and so this is kind of where the Omega part of this also comes into play

359
00:15:17,219 --> 00:15:21,559
is Omega is meant to be kind of a more broad and automated system.

360
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,679
Think of like the Linux,

361
00:15:22,869 --> 00:15:26,280
the open SSF scorecard project applying that

362
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:29,419
broadly across a great swath of open source

363
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,679
and then being very public about the findings,

364
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:32,719
I read this

365
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,799
and you know what the first thing I did was

366
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,229
I looked up all of the things just like this that happened after heartbleed

367
00:15:40,229 --> 00:15:41,320
and I thought

368
00:15:42,229 --> 00:15:44,369
I truly hope this works,

369
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,239
but

370
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,770
I'm going to hold my breath because

371
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,489
like

372
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:52,270
we have, this story has been told before.

373
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,289
This is the story of humanity.

374
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:59,109
I know. Oh, it's super important. Everybody.

375
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:01,989
My favorite is, you know, pick something really simple

376
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,549
to quote my former boss of full forecast and control.

377
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:07,989
We call them floodplains for a reason. Please stop building there.

378
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:11,630
-- Oh, wait, it's all the good soil. So people want to build there.
-- Well,

379
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:12,229
I

380
00:16:12,369 --> 00:16:12,419
view

381
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:13,880
of the river, it's like,

382
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,440
and then I love people are like, but how could we have known?

383
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:19,270
It's kind of like, well, I know Alberta publishes all the flood maps online.

384
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:20,989
There's like a website for it,

385
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:22,750
like, really detailed.

386
00:16:23,729 --> 00:16:23,979
Yeah.

387
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:24,409
So,

388
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:26,489
like when the Calgary flood happened is my sister's

389
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,710
house wasn't affected because my parents forced her to

390
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,390
buy a house. Not on the bow river flood plain.

391
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,820
I live on a hill. It's fine. Everything's

392
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:35,270
fine,

393
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:35,989
you know.

394
00:16:36,489 --> 00:16:38,030
Well, anyways, but, um,

395
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:38,690
I,

396
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:42,309
I do hope it works out and I think there is a chance now

397
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,570
because automation is possible in a way that it wasn't 10 years ago.

398
00:16:45,599 --> 00:16:48,809
Yeah, I, I do agree with that. I think we are in a

399
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:51,630
better place than we were after heartbleed.

400
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,109
But I think there's still always the,

401
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:57,989
the danger of this is the most important thing right now

402
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:01,219
and in six months it's going to be something else.

403
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,229
And as soon as the eye of Saron

404
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,650
is looking elsewhere,

405
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,489
all of this other work kind of collapses because no one cares anymore.

406
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,079
Yeah.

407
00:17:10,108 --> 00:17:11,699
Well, I remember back in 2014,

408
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:14,848
like even just having an automated build pipeline was basically magic,

409
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:16,358
let alone any security tool.

410
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:18,170
-- I
-- mean, back then even it was

411
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,118
the big talk was open.

412
00:17:20,453 --> 00:17:22,874
L was literally one person

413
00:17:23,493 --> 00:17:26,423
and then everyone's like, wait a minute, we should maybe fix this.

414
00:17:26,433 --> 00:17:26,864
And,

415
00:17:26,874 --> 00:17:31,034
and then you remember Open SSL was forked about 100 times and now there's

416
00:17:31,043 --> 00:17:34,473
like seven copies and Google has one and Open BS D has one and

417
00:17:34,693 --> 00:17:36,963
I think Amazon has one and

418
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:39,274
it's like, well, that's,

419
00:17:39,453 --> 00:17:41,313
that's one way to do this.

420
00:17:41,614 --> 00:17:43,774
I don't think anyone's forked logged for Jay yet.

421
00:17:43,803 --> 00:17:48,154
I really like the idea for something. As, see the problem with open SSL. Is that,

422
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,109
oh, we built a toolkit that does everything for everybody.

423
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:55,150
And that's good because that's ultimately what the world like,

424
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,250
certain parts of it need,

425
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,150
but the majority of the world needs something like the,

426
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,579
the strip down SSL where it's like

427
00:18:01,949 --> 00:18:05,589
we support the three common use cases. If that doesn't work for you go get open SSL.

428
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:08,780
-- Well,
-- and I mean, this is, I think what, what TLS

429
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,060
1.1 0.3 I think it's 1.3 they basically just took a machete

430
00:18:13,069 --> 00:18:16,300
to the TLS standard where like throw all this old crap away,

431
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,430
it's dangerous and no one should be using it.

432
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:22,140
It's one of those classic things where people engineered stuff that

433
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:22,989
is

434
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:27,500
nice to have, but it turns out to absolutely not be needed in the real world.

435
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:30,819
Like the, like renegotiating a protocol midstream.

436
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:32,209
Why,

437
00:18:32,349 --> 00:18:33,060
why do that?

438
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:33,890
Well, I mean,

439
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:38,780
but think about the attitude in the nineties was always be strict on what you send

440
00:18:38,949 --> 00:18:41,359
and generous with what you receive. And it turns out no

441
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,030
strict on what you said. It's stricter than what you receive everything else.

442
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,199
You just get rid of it.

443
00:18:46,969 --> 00:18:51,699
But it, it, it sort of made sense from an interoperability standpoint.

444
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:53,849
-- Well,
-- if you want to actually work at any point,

445
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,739
then that's how you get it to work is by having, you know,

446
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,079
fax machines that can essentially send faxes over garbage wires.

447
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:03,790
Right. Right. Well, and you have to remember, I mean, you had Linux,

448
00:19:04,069 --> 00:19:05,020
you had, so,

449
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,930
Os, you had Windows, you had OS two,

450
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:11,550
there were all these operating systems and they barely work with each other,

451
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,160
much less

452
00:19:12,439 --> 00:19:15,660
each other, you know, across the wires. And so

453
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,810
you had to be like that because, I mean,

454
00:19:17,819 --> 00:19:20,729
I remember Microsoft was notorious for just

455
00:19:20,739 --> 00:19:22,550
like sending garbage in their protocols.

456
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,699
And so you'd be like, eh, it's probably ok.

457
00:19:24,719 --> 00:19:27,160
My favorite fact is the old Windows talent client,

458
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,130
one character per packet.

459
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:34,160
And so it would, it would just destroy a

460
00:19:34,459 --> 00:19:35,709
lot of

461
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,349
TCP/IP stacks with the number of packets it's in

462
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:42,819
or like the buffers because who sends one packet per character?

463
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,989
Well, like apparently Microsoft, if you want it to be low latency,

464
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,060
right?

465
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:50,500
And, and nowadays, like we're laughing because, you know,

466
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,359
the slowest networks we probably have is like wi

467
00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:53,800
fi at a couple of 100 megabits per second.

468
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:54,109
But

469
00:19:54,349 --> 00:19:57,699
I remember when I had, you know, 10 megabit,

470
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:58,959
like

471
00:19:59,229 --> 00:19:59,910
coaxial

472
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,869
cable, attaching all my computers to each other.

473
00:20:03,089 --> 00:20:04,339
Dial up internet. And

474
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,250
I was about to say,

475
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:07,050
but my internet connection was dial up.

476
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:10,060
So like one packet per character would have flooded

477
00:20:10,069 --> 00:20:11,900
my network link if I was typing fast.

478
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:18,349
It's funny to think about

479
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:22,380
if nothing else just identifying what is critical is a good

480
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,760
first step because then we get a sense of scope.

481
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:28,449
Like, are these all like, do they actually have development efforts behind them?

482
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,469
We, we don't, we don't always know.

483
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,329
And, and here's,

484
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:34,890
I guess the one thing I will remind all of the listeners is

485
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,709
the open SSF is 100% going to do something you don't agree with

486
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:40,489
and

487
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,750
all of us will suffer from this and we're all

488
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,800
going to be tempted to be like those idiots.

489
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:45,969
They're getting it all wrong.

490
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:47,790
No,

491
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,510
that is the wrong attitude.

492
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,800
I think this is one of those instances of,

493
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:55,609
we need to put some effort into understanding these problems

494
00:20:55,729 --> 00:20:58,800
and we're going to make mistakes along the way. And so

495
00:20:59,209 --> 00:21:01,800
it's gonna be ok to Ridic ridicule them a little bit.

496
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:03,150
But fundamentally,

497
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:06,400
we need to be patient and we need to be involved in these projects.

498
00:21:06,469 --> 00:21:06,910
I don't think

499
00:21:07,459 --> 00:21:10,089
is the right word because part of this work that people

500
00:21:10,099 --> 00:21:13,260
forget is that this work is exploratory and research in nature.

501
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,770
We are trying, basically what we're saying is we're trying to solve a problem. Ok.

502
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,130
What is the exact problem? Well, it's kind of

503
00:21:19,349 --> 00:21:20,770
software security. Ok.

504
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,609
If somebody says software security is the problem,

505
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:23,900
they don't know what the problem is

506
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:27,250
that, that's like saying people die, we need to fix that.

507
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,819
No, you need to be a bit more. Are we talking car accidents or medicine?

508
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:37,349
All of it? All of it? No, I, I agree. I agree completely. I think you're, you're spot on

509
00:21:37,489 --> 00:21:37,680
and,

510
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,849
and I guess this is one of the challenges is today, everyone remembers the pain,

511
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:42,520
a blog for Jay.

512
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:46,109
So lots of organizations are willing to just like shovel money into this.

513
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:46,839
But

514
00:21:46,969 --> 00:21:50,199
if in a year they're like, all right, what, what, what progress have you made?

515
00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:54,000
And they're like, we think we've identified critical open

516
00:21:54,109 --> 00:21:54,719
source projects.

517
00:21:54,729 --> 00:21:59,439
They're like, what that, what I gave you $3 million like that's all you did.

518
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,109
And so I think that's gonna be part of the challenge.

519
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:06,010
Well, I mean, and part of the good news though is, is for a lot of these,

520
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,800
you're not going to actually have to do a

521
00:22:08,219 --> 00:22:12,609
lot to actually improve things because things are the, the bar is pretty low,

522
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,109
it's laying on the ground like don't trip over it. Yeah.

523
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:17,369
No,

524
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,959
but I like this because like a great example of this

525
00:22:19,969 --> 00:22:22,560
when I was looking at their sort of what defines criticality,

526
00:22:22,579 --> 00:22:25,619
is it that it does something important like the root level name servers,

527
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,310
is it that it's widely used?

528
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:30,949
Like uh what was it, the N PM left pad or left shift or whatever,

529
00:22:31,829 --> 00:22:32,420
you know, uh

530
00:22:32,689 --> 00:22:36,849
or is it something that takes user data from the network and processes it,

531
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:41,410
or is it a crypto component or you know what I mean? Like how do you define critical?

532
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,209
That's like,

533
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:46,609
-- I, I don't, I will admit, I don't have a good definition for what is
-- critical. No one

534
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:52,689
does and it's going to vary by users because what you consider critical, I might not.

535
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,949
And regulation explain that

536
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:55,430
right?

537
00:22:55,439 --> 00:22:57,859
For the people that live in regulated industries, it's like, well,

538
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,750
whether or not you want to care about this, the law says you have to.

539
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,150
Right.

540
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:01,410
Yeah.

541
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,900
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Now, I, I think one of the,

542
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:07,099
one of the interesting aspects of this is going to be.

543
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,939
So if you have a critical package, let's say we,

544
00:23:09,949 --> 00:23:12,530
we create some standard that defines criticality.

545
00:23:12,569 --> 00:23:16,520
So now are the dependencies of the critical package also critical packages.

546
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,619
And I, I would, I would tend to say yes,

547
00:23:18,729 --> 00:23:20,969
but I don't know if that's the way this is going to work.

548
00:23:20,979 --> 00:23:23,670
But I think there's a lot of really weird and

549
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,050
strange nuance that's going to fall out of this as we go along

550
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:32,209
well. And part of the beauty is it doesn't matter if they're critical or not.

551
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,949
The very fact that we're attempting to start to measure this

552
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:37,750
is a huge step forward.

553
00:23:38,229 --> 00:23:39,880
It's, it's absolutely. And

554
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,709
I think the really important part is there's currently a project

555
00:23:42,719 --> 00:23:45,760
with the Linux Foundation has they call it L XL FX.

556
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,310
I, I forget the name of it off the top of my head,

557
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:51,609
but they're kind of trying to do this where they're scoring open source,

558
00:23:51,619 --> 00:23:52,790
but it's not public data.

559
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,930
You have to be a member of the project and you have to

560
00:23:54,939 --> 00:23:57,719
log into their special dashboard and then you can see the information,

561
00:23:57,729 --> 00:23:58,689
but I feel like

562
00:23:58,969 --> 00:24:02,239
this is an open source. You can't be, you can't work this way.

563
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,650
It has to be very public, it has to be very open.

564
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:07,599
And then I think you have opportunities for people to start saying, OK,

565
00:24:07,609 --> 00:24:10,229
now I understand what this project is doing and you can decide,

566
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,250
I either need to invest in it.

567
00:24:12,449 --> 00:24:13,569
I need to drop it.

568
00:24:13,699 --> 00:24:16,400
You know what I mean? So, like, what are we gonna do now?

569
00:24:16,449 --> 00:24:18,719
-- I'm
-- gonna
-- disagree slightly in that.

570
00:24:18,979 --> 00:24:20,369
I think part of the problem is

571
00:24:20,489 --> 00:24:22,920
so perfect example, back when we worked at Red Hat, remember I would,

572
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:25,199
we would assign CV S for issues right away.

573
00:24:25,209 --> 00:24:27,672
Yep. Yep. And then we might not fix them for a long time.

574
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,353
And that actually was a problem sometimes where other companies would be like,

575
00:24:30,363 --> 00:24:32,272
look, ha ha Red Hat has these outstanding CV.

576
00:24:32,282 --> 00:24:33,812
S for days and weeks and months on end.

577
00:24:33,822 --> 00:24:36,172
And it's like, yes, because as soon as we know it's a vulnerability,

578
00:24:36,182 --> 00:24:38,062
we gave it a CV versus your company.

579
00:24:38,072 --> 00:24:41,703
-- That only does the CV. The moment you release the pain.
-- That was, that was Microsoft.

580
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:44,973
We don't have to pretend like that. They, they don't work like that anymore.

581
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,522
But that, that's what they used to do. But

582
00:24:46,682 --> 00:24:47,892
I think there is an element of

583
00:24:48,005 --> 00:24:49,526
that in keeping this data private.

584
00:24:49,536 --> 00:24:52,826
And right, especially because the data is not great yet.

585
00:24:52,836 --> 00:24:55,385
Like, it's not, we don't know that it's necessarily correct.

586
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:59,465
And so I think part of it is I would be OK with the system, for example,

587
00:24:59,475 --> 00:25:00,906
that the project can make it public.

588
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:04,515
But I, I don't want projects having to deal with the press, writing articles like,

589
00:25:04,526 --> 00:25:08,276
oh, you know, this project that's supposed to be very important is like, got a,

590
00:25:08,286 --> 00:25:09,456
got an F,

591
00:25:09,989 --> 00:25:12,239
you know, why did they get an F like the blah, blah, blah?

592
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,209
No, I, I think you're wrong.

593
00:25:14,219 --> 00:25:18,689
I think if there is a project that's supposed to be critical and it's getting an F,

594
00:25:19,189 --> 00:25:20,790
let's make it not an F,

595
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:23,750
what I'm saying is for now while it's still in the infancy,

596
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,170
kind of keep it private on the download.

597
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,890
So they don't have to deal with this, you know, this insanity.

598
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,579
-- But at some point it does have to be opened up.
-- Absolutely.

599
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,369
I, I don't know. II,

600
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,989
I might be able to be convinced but I often err

601
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,729
on the side of openness for things like this because I think

602
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:39,790
if you don't open it,

603
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,130
it creates,

604
00:25:41,569 --> 00:25:43,750
it's easy to drag your feet. You know what I mean?

605
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,229
I see this all the time, especially when,

606
00:25:46,439 --> 00:25:47,780
when I'm working with

607
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:52,630
a project or, or some other people and like a get repo might be private and it's like,

608
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,780
oh, I'll fix that code later.

609
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,819
It's like, no you won't,

610
00:25:55,589 --> 00:25:56,699
let's fix it now.

611
00:25:56,959 --> 00:26:01,150
And if it's open, it's like, oh, wait, I'm going to, I'm going to push this, commit.

612
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,060
My name is going to be on it. I don't like this code. I'm going to fix it.

613
00:26:04,219 --> 00:26:04,709
You know what I mean?

614
00:26:04,719 --> 00:26:09,739
No, I think openness needs to ultimately be the end state for this to be

615
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:14,619
valuable. But during that sort of initial exploratory research phase,

616
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:17,180
you just said that I still, I'm not going to agree.

617
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:17,949
I don't know

618
00:26:18,099 --> 00:26:18,260
it.

619
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:20,339
But here's the thing, you can always go from close to open.

620
00:26:20,349 --> 00:26:21,800
You can't go from open to closed

621
00:26:22,579 --> 00:26:25,959
because the moment anything tries to go from open to closed, it's like, well,

622
00:26:25,969 --> 00:26:26,660
a great example.

623
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,209
O is V DB, they went from open to closed and it's dead.

624
00:26:29,969 --> 00:26:31,469
Uh, they just got bought,

625
00:26:31,939 --> 00:26:32,800
who cares?

626
00:26:33,099 --> 00:26:36,489
-- I mean, I agree
-- but like, I, I don't know what their data said.

627
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,589
If it's any good or not, I don't care, like, unless I pay them a pile of money,

628
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,089
I just don't care about them anymore.

629
00:26:41,449 --> 00:26:43,420
They, they took themselves out of the ecosystem.

630
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:46,910
-- It's complicated, I think. But
-- you know what I'm saying? Right. Like it's,

631
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,540
I used to care about OS V DB.

632
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:51,310
They used to matter, they used to be important, they used to be useful.

633
00:26:51,619 --> 00:26:53,849
Now it's just another private database. Who cares?

634
00:26:54,209 --> 00:26:56,390
Yeah, I know. That's another story.

635
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,349
I mean, and, and so, like,

636
00:26:58,699 --> 00:27:00,170
I guess let's finish up,

637
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:03,670
let's let's talk about this Samba thing that just came out as well.

638
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,589
So there's a Samba R ce which is a huge deal, of course.

639
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:08,390
And

640
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,270
-- I imagine all the ransomware guys are like
-- w

641
00:27:14,109 --> 00:27:16,050
yeah, you know it, but here's what's eating me.

642
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,750
And this was true of the pone kit CV E as well.

643
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,569
Like if you look at the CV E at the time, Kurt and I are recording,

644
00:27:21,579 --> 00:27:23,979
it's been more than 24 hours since the Samba

645
00:27:24,369 --> 00:27:25,609
advisory went out.

646
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:28,160
Now that the advisory was funny too because they had, they got the,

647
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,670
they got the CV E wrong.

648
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:32,469
It's a 2021 CV E but they accidentally called

649
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:34,699
it 2022 in the first draft of the advisory.

650
00:27:34,709 --> 00:27:35,329
So that's kind of

651
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,380
silly.

652
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,260
But like the,

653
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:40,199
the entry in the CV E database is still blank and it's

654
00:27:40,209 --> 00:27:43,959
like this is one of the biggest deals happening right now.

655
00:27:43,969 --> 00:27:47,140
-- How is this still
-- blank? It's in the reserved state.

656
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,329
-- So it's technically not like, oh,
-- whatever. That's,

657
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,709
but a lot of people think reserve CV S exist

658
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:57,180
-- in a useful sense and they don't as
-- many reserved as there are filled out CV.

659
00:27:57,489 --> 00:27:58,060
There's more now,

660
00:27:58,219 --> 00:27:58,979
probably

661
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,790
-- don't count.
-- No, not, probably there's more now like

662
00:28:03,579 --> 00:28:06,609
they've got huge blocks of reserve CV S and so people

663
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:09,050
think like people look at the CV database and go wow,

664
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,439
it goes up to like 40 or 50,000 and it's like,

665
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:14,369
no, those are like mostly reserved.

666
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,920
Like you look at the NVD data where they just,

667
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:18,390
they don't even bother carrying the reserve CV S because there's nothing there.

668
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,079
It says literally

669
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:19,959
value

670
00:28:20,069 --> 00:28:20,880
reserved.

671
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:23,550
This candidate has been reserved by an organization or individual

672
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,459
that will use it when announcing a new security problem.

673
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,140
It doesn't matter,

674
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:26,300
it

675
00:28:26,459 --> 00:28:26,630
doesn't matter.

676
00:28:26,979 --> 00:28:28,819
-- The point is no,
-- no, but the sentence was

677
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,650
when the candidate has been publicized,

678
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,599
the details for this candidate will be provided.

679
00:28:34,719 --> 00:28:36,219
Ok, cool. Can you do that?

680
00:28:36,969 --> 00:28:38,560
Yeah, get on that.

681
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,300
I mean, but it, it's

682
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:44,890
Samba having an R ce is a huge deal, right?

683
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,250
Like, but then

684
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,489
the challenge becomes now

685
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:51,979
it has a CV E, the data is not published and it

686
00:28:52,329 --> 00:28:53,689
-- is
-- that CV, the correct number.

687
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:54,589
I

688
00:28:55,089 --> 00:28:55,709
got it. Right. But

689
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:56,540
-- maybe they
-- did.

690
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,449
But you know what I mean?

691
00:28:58,729 --> 00:29:01,150
I feel like this is again one of those

692
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,969
instances where we have some security infrastructure but it's like

693
00:29:06,339 --> 00:29:11,209
-- sort of there. But it's definitely failing us.
-- It's operationally broken.

694
00:29:11,979 --> 00:29:12,680
Yeah, I agree.

695
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:15,709
It's like a wheelchair lift. That doesn't work. Cool. You have a wheelchair lift?

696
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:17,359
Does it work? No, it doesn't. It doesn't

697
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,949
like it'll work tomorrow.

698
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,030
Well, that's not very good for me today.

699
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,239
And I'm sorry, but

700
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,109
you can have the world's best

701
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,560
wheelchair lift. But if it doesn't work then it's,

702
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:29,520
it's not a wheelchair lift. If it doesn't

703
00:29:29,689 --> 00:29:33,660
like this. The fact is even log for Jay had the same thing

704
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,130
where it was out for, over, well over, like, it was known to be an issue for well,

705
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,260
over 24 hours before it got into the CV database.

706
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,130
You know, and this, like, Samba thing is now what?

707
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,180
It's at least 24 hours, maybe more, maybe less.

708
00:29:44,189 --> 00:29:45,380
I don't know if there's a weekend coming up,

709
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:47,130
maybe after the weekend they'll get to it.

710
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:49,160
And that's the beauty is we don't know.

711
00:29:49,689 --> 00:29:54,550
No, I know. It's all, it's all hidden behind a veil of mystery and

712
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:57,140
-- it's definitely frustrating and annoying
-- to me.

713
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,819
This is a big deal.

714
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,989
I wrote up the GST entry in about five minutes.

715
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:01,750
I

716
00:30:01,989 --> 00:30:03,630
know and like handcrafted the

717
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:03,910
JSON

718
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,530
because I don't have a tool to do it yet. And it's on my to do list.

719
00:30:06,979 --> 00:30:07,810
There's literally

720
00:30:08,219 --> 00:30:09,290
like, that's so wrong.

721
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,449
Like if I had a tool, it would have taken me two minutes,

722
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:13,530
you know.

723
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,119
So we're going to write a tool to do this so that

724
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,489
-- anybody can fill up these C DS because that the
-- Royal,

725
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:18,069
we,

726
00:30:18,209 --> 00:30:18,560
yeah,

727
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:20,810
this is, this is beyond ridiculous that

728
00:30:21,489 --> 00:30:22,069
it, it's,

729
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,390
but, but I mean,

730
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,699
this is one of the challenges and I

731
00:30:24,709 --> 00:30:28,390
think this ties into the Alpha and Omega discussion

732
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:33,050
that we kind of started with and, and even the N PM discussion to a degree is there's,

733
00:30:33,229 --> 00:30:36,939
there's all of this security knowledge, there's all of this security technology

734
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,420
and it is still

735
00:30:38,609 --> 00:30:42,569
incredibly difficult to put the pieces together and make it work.

736
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:43,869
We accomplish things

737
00:30:43,979 --> 00:30:46,060
in spite of our tooling today in the world,

738
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:49,510
we don't accomplish things because of our tooling.

739
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,300
And that is the problem.

740
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:54,069
I, I think there's a lot of unnecessary gatekeeping.

741
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:59,569
I mean, yeah, I agree because humans are

742
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:04,839
in all of these processes and humans are terrible at everything. They do

743
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:10,829
-- also. They're inconsistently terrible.
-- Yes. That's what I mean. Right.

744
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:14,270
-- It's just like
-- if we were consistently terrible, then we could just throw it away.

745
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,979
But the problem is sometimes they're good. So we're like, oh, it's ok.

746
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,459
Anyway, anyway, I guess

747
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:23,969
if you're listening to us and you haven't patched your Samba servers yet,

748
00:31:23,979 --> 00:31:25,359
you might want to go do that.
