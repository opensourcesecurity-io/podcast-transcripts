0
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:01,429
All right. Did you want to lead this one or me?

1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,409
-- I, I don't know. It's December 20
-- first,

2
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:05,739
21st.

3
00:00:05,989 --> 00:00:06,130
Bug

4
00:00:06,369 --> 00:00:07,340
-- bounties.
-- All right.

5
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:08,770
Uh, I like them. I love bug

6
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,829
for two big reasons. One,

7
00:00:11,159 --> 00:00:14,460
it's, it, it strongly signals,

8
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,180
not only that you can report a bug but where to report it and how to report it.

9
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,829
Right. Because not, not all projects are clear on that. You know, I,

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,190
I remember one project they wanted you to log into their IRC server

11
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:26,129
to get,

12
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,719
to ask for an account in their bug tracker so you could file the security bug.

13
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:32,470
And the rationale was, they had a lot of spam in their, yeah,

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,380
I remember we talked about it was a Fedora project because

15
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:35,900
they were getting a lot of spam in their bug trackers.

16
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:38,470
So they locked it down and this was how they handled account creation.

17
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,130
I'm like, well, you're never going to get a bug report. It's just too much work.

18
00:00:42,139 --> 00:00:46,389
-- You know?
-- Actually that's interesting because if you work with a bug bounty.

19
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,529
All right. For, I guess one thing too, like we had, don't roll your own crypto.

20
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,130
Don't roll your own off. Don't run your own bug bounty.

21
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:54,435
-- Well,
-- what's the difference between having, like,

22
00:00:54,444 --> 00:00:56,875
security at bob.com versus security at bob.com?

23
00:00:56,884 --> 00:01:00,305
-- And we'll pay you 20 bucks for security
-- at Bob. Well, ok, so here's the problem is

24
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:05,794
-- in most countries there are legal implications to paying people.
-- Oh, good point.

25
00:01:05,805 --> 00:01:06,764
Yeah. And

26
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:11,084
-- for example, if we have a bug money at Elastic, we use hacker one.
-- Yeah.

27
00:01:11,095 --> 00:01:13,675
Do you fill out the W eight ban or the W eight Ben?

28
00:01:14,165 --> 00:01:16,525
-- Right.
-- And like it is hacker one's problem

29
00:01:16,705 --> 00:01:19,504
to figure out if we can or can't pay that person money.

30
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,040
Yeah, because, like, for example,

31
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:25,089
the United States isn't allowed to give money to people in a couple of countries.

32
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:27,690
Well, and there's also the, well, the restricted people's list,

33
00:01:27,699 --> 00:01:30,069
there's also people on this list from

34
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:33,169
-- the Department of State that you're not allowed to do stuff with.
-- Yeah.

35
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:34,160
Right. Right.

36
00:01:34,169 --> 00:01:35,410
Because imagine if a,

37
00:01:35,419 --> 00:01:38,290
if a terrorist organization started claiming bug

38
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,209
bounties and if you gave them money,

39
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,760
like, you're going to get a visit from a guy in a black suit, you know,

40
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:44,650
probably more than one.

41
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,410
Uh, yeah. No, I, I apologize.

42
00:01:47,419 --> 00:01:50,550
I, I, every time this topic comes up I forget that,

43
00:01:50,559 --> 00:01:52,309
that the whole payment thing is such a nightmare,

44
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,050
which you think I would realize because I get,

45
00:01:54,059 --> 00:01:58,540
I do most of my contracts for American companies and I go through this constantly,

46
00:01:58,779 --> 00:01:59,769
you know, and, well,

47
00:01:59,779 --> 00:02:04,290
and then the second thing too is bug bounties are an ongoing security thing.

48
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:04,690
Right.

49
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,849
I, for example, I hate

50
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:07,849
code audits

51
00:02:08,326 --> 00:02:08,826
because

52
00:02:09,015 --> 00:02:10,045
you do a code audit,

53
00:02:10,056 --> 00:02:14,016
you find some flaws and I guarantee you if you pay a different group of code auditors

54
00:02:14,156 --> 00:02:16,886
the same or more money, they will find a separate set,

55
00:02:16,897 --> 00:02:18,417
like they will find a bunch more flaws.

56
00:02:18,427 --> 00:02:20,557
And so a bug bounty doesn't pretend

57
00:02:20,667 --> 00:02:22,136
that we found all the bugs and it's good.

58
00:02:22,147 --> 00:02:27,087
It's a bug bounty is part of the process of making this thing less of a tire fire.

59
00:02:27,097 --> 00:02:30,386
Well, and look, I'm going, I've been through many code audits.

60
00:02:30,397 --> 00:02:31,136
I,

61
00:02:31,223 --> 00:02:35,723
I don't run it anymore but I ran a bug bunny and I will tell you now that the quality of

62
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:38,223
bugs you get out of a bug bounty are significantly

63
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:39,944
higher than what you get out of a code audit.

64
00:02:39,953 --> 00:02:41,973
I would assume that that would depend on who you hire.

65
00:02:41,983 --> 00:02:43,904
But the reality is code auditors.

66
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,703
The good ones are super, not cheap and more to the point. There's

67
00:02:47,054 --> 00:02:49,673
-- 1000 of them globally made
-- and they only have,

68
00:02:49,684 --> 00:02:52,324
usually you get a code audit for like two weeks or something.

69
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:57,341
Right. There's that time box around it where a bug hunter can spend infinite time

70
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,751
-- on your stuff if they want to.
-- That's a good point.

71
00:02:59,761 --> 00:03:02,910
They can take that like slow approach of, for example, a run through a fuzz,

72
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:04,380
then look at the results then,

73
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:07,841
you know, coordinate with this other person. Yeah. No, I suspect you're right.

74
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,141
-- Yeah, time constraint would matter.
-- And they don't find anything.

75
00:03:11,281 --> 00:03:14,820
I don't have to pay them if my code auditor doesn't find anything.

76
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,930
I still have to cut him a big fat check.

77
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:21,520
Yeah. Somehow I feel like there's no code auditors that, you know, work on a win.

78
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,949
-- No, no win. No pay fee structure.
-- No.

79
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,000
And look, the other thing too is when you get a code audit,

80
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:31,190
you get a fancy letter that says you got a code audit and

81
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:34,009
then there's certain customers that you hand the letter to and they say,

82
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,550
oh, good job, you got a code audit.

83
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:39,229
And that's the really the real reason behind it more so than what you,

84
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,410
what you get found.

85
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:43,227
-- Oh, yeah, I've seen that checkbox. Do you have third party code audit?
-- Right.

86
00:03:43,236 --> 00:03:46,067
-- Because if you don't, then
-- why not? Here's the question.

87
00:03:46,076 --> 00:03:48,496
-- Do bug bunnings count as a third party code audit?
-- No,

88
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:50,496
I've been,

89
00:03:50,557 --> 00:03:53,106
I've been very interested in this topic for a

90
00:03:53,117 --> 00:03:55,046
long time and I've talked to many customers.

91
00:03:55,057 --> 00:03:57,817
I've talked to many bug bounty people about the fact that it

92
00:03:57,826 --> 00:04:01,496
would be lovely to be able to say a bug bounty is,

93
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:02,807
you know, we have a bug bounty in place.

94
00:04:02,817 --> 00:04:04,266
We have people looking at this and we're finding

95
00:04:04,276 --> 00:04:06,736
these kind of bug and basically giving statistics on what's

96
00:04:07,223 --> 00:04:10,684
of what it looks like versus necessarily saying because we,

97
00:04:10,694 --> 00:04:12,363
I've been involved with code audits.

98
00:04:12,373 --> 00:04:16,873
I pay a lot of money for code audits and I think the letter has value

99
00:04:16,983 --> 00:04:18,764
but the results of the code audits,

100
00:04:18,773 --> 00:04:21,483
-- I think has been less than the bug bounties
-- for sure.

101
00:04:21,493 --> 00:04:23,924
And objectively, depending on what your bug bounty pays.

102
00:04:23,933 --> 00:04:25,384
Obviously, if your bug bounty pays a dollar,

103
00:04:25,394 --> 00:04:26,683
you're probably not going to get good stuff.

104
00:04:26,694 --> 00:04:29,324
But there are bug bounties out there that pay in the hundreds of thousands.

105
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:30,723
We do not pay that much.

106
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:35,311
But we, let's say there, we, at one point our numbers were very low and yes,

107
00:04:35,321 --> 00:04:38,901
the amount you're paying dictates what you're going to get.

108
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:40,941
Because yes, if you have a bug money not paying a lot,

109
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,911
you're just not going to get a lot of results.

110
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,651
Well, I'm going to go somewhere where the money is. Yeah.

111
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:47,631
It's definitely a very money driven environment.

112
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,800
-- Well,
-- it's, these people are doing work for money.

113
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:50,151
That's

114
00:04:50,371 --> 00:04:51,790
-- right.
-- And they're money driven. Like,

115
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,860
who knew, who knew anyway. Anyway.

116
00:04:53,871 --> 00:04:55,911
Also, we still need an unpaid intern.

117
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,330
No,

118
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,790
-- I'll see you on December 22nd
-- car. Thanks everybody.
