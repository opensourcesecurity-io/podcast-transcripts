Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,329
Kurt Siefried and my partner in lacking an API, Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,949
Do I lack an API

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:14,130
for the

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,600
Os S podcast? There's no API,

5
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:18,959
there's kind of an API, I mean,

6
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:21,809
so we have an RSS feed for the podcast that

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:22,649
then

8
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:27,100
I guess it's an API. But then also, so the service we use

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,110
Liben,

10
00:00:28,299 --> 00:00:32,930
they do have an API and I have, I have considered scripting everything I do.

11
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:33,979
Actually, we use uh Liben

12
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:35,319
host, the

13
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:36,400
audio

14
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:38,919
and wordpress host the blog

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,689
or the website, whatever you want to call it. It, it's just a blog,

16
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,889
but there are API S and I have considered automating all of this.

17
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,380
So instead of like manually fiddling with it,

18
00:00:49,389 --> 00:00:51,930
I just like type make or something and it goes, but

19
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,009
see, there's how you're doing it wrong.

20
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,169
If you're gonna automate this,

21
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,590
I'll walk you through doing it in zap year in about 20 minutes.

22
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:01,250
Do I have to pay for ZAP year? Not at three level anyway.

23
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:06,071
Well, and you get like 700 zaps a month, which for us would be a lot enough. I need four

24
00:01:06,202 --> 00:01:06,552
Yeah.

25
00:01:07,181 --> 00:01:09,921
Well, no, but each zap would have multiple things because you'd want to have it,

26
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:12,332
like, upload the file, fire up the blog

27
00:01:12,452 --> 00:01:15,141
press, do this, do that, do that. But like using something like Zapper

28
00:01:15,561 --> 00:01:16,912
done in like minutes.

29
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:21,781
That sounds like more work than I care about. I have a process that works.

30
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:22,251
Ok.

31
00:01:22,262 --> 00:01:23,751
Before we get to the topic,

32
00:01:23,762 --> 00:01:26,893
which is api related as people have probably ascertained.

33
00:01:26,903 --> 00:01:30,783
I have discovered the most amazing thing and I told you about it yesterday.

34
00:01:30,793 --> 00:01:33,973
So mcdonald's the, the giant fast food company,

35
00:01:33,984 --> 00:01:35,954
they have a character named Grimace who many

36
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:37,353
people may not know about because Grimace,

37
00:01:37,704 --> 00:01:40,253
I'm glad you qualified that mcdonald's is giant

38
00:01:40,424 --> 00:01:41,613
because I, I wasn't aware.

39
00:01:41,624 --> 00:01:43,204
Look, look, man, I'm,

40
00:01:43,223 --> 00:01:47,333
this is for the people thousands of years in the future who uncovered his podcast

41
00:01:48,045 --> 00:01:50,805
and they're wondering like, what are these two idiots doing?

42
00:01:50,975 --> 00:01:53,575
So, anyway, mcdonald's has all these characters and you don't,

43
00:01:53,585 --> 00:01:57,045
-- you don't really hear about many of them anymore,
-- whatever happened to hamburglar.

44
00:01:57,055 --> 00:02:01,875
-- Like, is he just doing time?
-- He's probably not a role model for Children anymore.

45
00:02:02,216 --> 00:02:06,216
But anyway, there's a character named Grimace and he's a very strange character.

46
00:02:06,225 --> 00:02:08,425
No one knows what he is. He's purple

47
00:02:08,526 --> 00:02:09,996
and apparently it's his birthday.

48
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,330
And so mcdonald's because

49
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:14,479
is like, there's this meal you can get called Grimace's birthday,

50
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,559
which I actually went and got when I

51
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,679
learned about this and the milkshake is whatever,

52
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,240
like I've had worse I've had better.

53
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:23,350
Is it purple? It is purple. Apparently when you eat the fries it changes flavor.

54
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,479
But I, I couldn't really tell and it just tasted like sugar, like,

55
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,449
but

56
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:29,889
-- it
-- was

57
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:31,350
shocked

58
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:33,779
that a mcdonald's food product

59
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,720
that comes in a cup would taste like shrimp.

60
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:39,070
-- I,
-- I'm sure I got four days worth of calories from eating that meal.

61
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,539
But they, they actually have shakes that are over 3000 calories here.

62
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:42,910
-- I,
-- I

63
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:44,509
-- have
-- no doubt. Anyway. Anyway,

64
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:47,384
no, no, no, we're not, we're not discussing our terrible eating habits.

65
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:49,854
So, anyway, it's part of this, there's this website called Grimes's

66
00:02:50,054 --> 00:02:52,304
Birthday and it looks like something out of the nineties because it,

67
00:02:52,315 --> 00:02:53,304
it's amazing looking.

68
00:02:53,315 --> 00:02:56,345
Also. Grimace is 52 apparently, which seems like a strange

69
00:02:56,675 --> 00:03:00,494
age to make a big deal about on the website. There's this little game, right?

70
00:03:00,835 --> 00:03:01,304
And

71
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:06,210
when you play the game, it looks like something from the nineties as the website is.

72
00:03:06,339 --> 00:03:07,820
And it turns out the, the,

73
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:13,119
the game is literally a game boy color rom that they're emulating in the web browser.

74
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:17,059
You can extract the rom and play it on a real game boy color,

75
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:19,660
which is amazing to me.

76
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:22,380
And of course, the, the, the weirdos on youtube were,

77
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:27,610
were commenting how mcdonald's is now a game publisher apparently, but like I

78
00:03:27,725 --> 00:03:30,395
was blown away by the fact that they hired a

79
00:03:30,404 --> 00:03:33,445
company to make them a game for Game Boy color.

80
00:03:33,455 --> 00:03:37,285
And then anyone can play it. It's like that is so amazing to me.

81
00:03:37,294 --> 00:03:39,175
-- This
-- is
-- another show we need to do at some point.

82
00:03:39,184 --> 00:03:41,565
But I think we're rapidly getting to the point where

83
00:03:41,695 --> 00:03:41,964
OK.

84
00:03:41,975 --> 00:03:45,214
It reminds me of back when I uh like this is 20 some years ago,

85
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,264
flood forecasting control had remote machines like remote data

86
00:03:48,274 --> 00:03:50,695
collection equipment for like river levels and flow meters

87
00:03:50,955 --> 00:03:53,664
with custom silicon chips to like

88
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:55,500
connect to a phone line and blah, blah blah.

89
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:57,919
And nowadays the answer would be like, no, just get like

90
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:58,139
a

91
00:03:58,289 --> 00:03:58,339
AAA

92
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,309
system on a board computer and write some Python script

93
00:04:01,619 --> 00:04:06,949
and like use about 6 million times more lines of code than is necessary.

94
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,270
But who cares? It's a Python script.

95
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:10,910
It's clear to me that web browsers are now at that point where it's like

96
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:15,369
I want to build like an A RVR thing that needs all these crazy capabilities.

97
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:15,679
Well, yeah,

98
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,540
the web browser will just do that and just

99
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,548
whack it through some framework in the web browser.

100
00:04:19,894 --> 00:04:24,244
And so I bet every software project kind of goes to heck in a handbasket

101
00:04:24,415 --> 00:04:25,644
schedule wise.

102
00:04:26,364 --> 00:04:26,714
But

103
00:04:27,065 --> 00:04:30,105
for example, using an old DEV kit where you're kind of, you know,

104
00:04:30,114 --> 00:04:33,475
there's like strong guard, like think about color game boy, there's,

105
00:04:33,484 --> 00:04:36,625
there's gonna be guardrails like you can only do XY and Z right.

106
00:04:36,635 --> 00:04:38,774
You can really only make a game, you can't like,

107
00:04:38,785 --> 00:04:40,834
you don't have to worry about a web browser you don't have to worry about this.

108
00:04:40,845 --> 00:04:42,255
You don't have to worry about that. Like,

109
00:04:42,394 --> 00:04:43,554
I'm guessing that, that

110
00:04:43,915 --> 00:04:45,864
you could probably, like once you get the art

111
00:04:46,179 --> 00:04:49,160
assets done and the basic gameplay figured out,

112
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,359
you can probably crank out a game boy game

113
00:04:51,929 --> 00:04:53,279
in like a couple of weeks.

114
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:57,500
There's really good tools as well that help you along this path.

115
00:04:57,779 --> 00:04:58,109
Well,

116
00:04:58,329 --> 00:04:59,720
very mature tools.

117
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,029
Uh Yeah,

118
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,709
which is funny because like all of the hacker types did

119
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,920
all this work because Nintendo's not releasing a DEV kit for this

120
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,070
-- and
-- it kind

121
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:10,109
-- of
-- runs. Remember all the flash games that went by by

122
00:05:10,295 --> 00:05:11,644
flash went bye bye. But like

123
00:05:11,815 --> 00:05:13,904
this really speaks to, you know,

124
00:05:13,915 --> 00:05:17,114
if I because if somebody tried to build this game using a modern framework,

125
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,114
it still wouldn't be done.

126
00:05:18,355 --> 00:05:18,864
That's it.

127
00:05:19,005 --> 00:05:21,635
-- And that kind of speaks to API S and power use.
-- It does.

128
00:05:21,644 --> 00:05:25,315
Strangely enough, it's totally related to our topic, which is

129
00:05:25,445 --> 00:05:27,424
API S and power users. OK?

130
00:05:27,524 --> 00:05:28,635
What is an API?

131
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:33,170
And API is an application programming interface? And the idea is

132
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,980
you have a piece of software and typically pieces of software

133
00:05:35,989 --> 00:05:38,459
have some sort of interface once they get complicated enough.

134
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,480
So we're, we're not talking about command line utilities anymore.

135
00:05:40,489 --> 00:05:41,480
We're talking about like

136
00:05:41,989 --> 00:05:42,869
a big Honkin

137
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:47,760
app that like like Microsoft Word or Excel or some web service thing or whatever.

138
00:05:47,769 --> 00:05:48,869
Sure. And so

139
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,489
traditionally what happens?

140
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,130
Actually, Red Hat did this really well,

141
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,380
red hat when they would build something big and complicated,

142
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,230
would first of all build the command line tools.

143
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:57,489
And so

144
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,600
once you have command line tools, you have a working system and you can automate it.

145
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,899
And now you can stick a web front end on it

146
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,989
that calls the command line tools effectively. Right.

147
00:06:07,179 --> 00:06:07,890
Yep, that's right.

148
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:12,420
And that web front end can be have a nice interface and it can, you know, like log in,

149
00:06:12,429 --> 00:06:13,890
add a user whatever

150
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:19,220
and you can have like gated access and workflows and permissions and stuff.

151
00:06:19,549 --> 00:06:22,010
But the problem becomes what happens when somebody needs

152
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:24,720
to do something that your interface does not support or

153
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,600
more likely needs to integrate it with another system. Well, they can't,

154
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,519
well, and that's where an API comes in.

155
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:33,059
You have an application programming interface where basically

156
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,640
you can touch all the knobs,

157
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:39,649
twiddle, all the knobs, get all the data in and out, do everything possible.

158
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:42,429
And now it's up to you to build something to do what you need it to do.

159
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,829
And I'm, I'm actually in this situation right now.

160
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:49,440
Uh The cloud security alliances has a uh we, we pay for this uh social platform

161
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,380
and I need to get the user's email address out of it so

162
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,910
that we can add them to the freaking Google groups as needed.

163
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,390
OK?

164
00:06:55,809 --> 00:06:56,269
OK.

165
00:06:56,679 --> 00:07:00,209
In the email that we send out to the group of men, you can add their first name,

166
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,399
their last name their company name.

167
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,190
There's like a whole mail merge with a list of variables that you can do.

168
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,010
Not their email address.

169
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:08,470
The reason API S are so critical

170
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:10,200
is it's your power users.

171
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:13,250
It's the people integrating this thing with another system.

172
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,750
It's the people building a tool that says, you know,

173
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,269
instead of clicking on each user profile and

174
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,589
cutting and paste the email address out,

175
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,380
we just want to automate that because

176
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:24,380
like seriously, right? Like that's our current workflows.

177
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,890
They click on the link, they cut and paste the email address into another thing.

178
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:30,079
And I'm like, that's no, we're, we're automating that. Like

179
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,160
that's ridiculous.

180
00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:37,769
And so that's why API S are so critical because the majority of people will never

181
00:07:38,299 --> 00:07:42,359
see an API most people will actually never interact with an

182
00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:45,619
API because they'll use sort of the default website or the default

183
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:46,600
interface.

184
00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:50,359
But the secret is the people who use power tools or third party clients,

185
00:07:50,619 --> 00:07:52,059
they're the ones using API S

186
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,260
and if you take API S away from them,

187
00:07:54,739 --> 00:07:57,540
you basically break life for all your power users

188
00:07:58,049 --> 00:08:00,480
and all your third party apps and all your integrations.

189
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:06,029
That's right. And this is what Reddit did, which is why it's news at the moment.

190
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,429
-- But Twitter has done this as well.
-- They did it but Reddit did it in a way.

191
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,920
That is so unspeakably ridiculous because no,

192
00:08:12,179 --> 00:08:15,940
no, because remember Reddit basically said we're gonna charge access to the API

193
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,890
OK. That sucks. But fair.

194
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:21,470
But then they like literally two or three days later realized and sent out.

195
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,739
They put that posting on the website at the top

196
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,940
saying moderator tools and bots will have free API access.

197
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,100
Like they literally forgot that their website

198
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,510
literally cannot work without these automated bots and moderation tools

199
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,479
to keep all the spam and horror show stuff out,

200
00:08:37,489 --> 00:08:38,289
right?

201
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:40,409
They literally didn't think that through.

202
00:08:41,489 --> 00:08:45,869
I think you could say they didn't think that through is pretty much the,

203
00:08:46,008 --> 00:08:49,169
the the slogan for everything reddit has done for

204
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:51,708
the last two or three weeks at this point.

205
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:57,869
And it is amusing to me. So here's where I think this conversation gets very fun

206
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:02,260
is like Twitter locked out their API at one point where they started charging for it,

207
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:02,450
right?

208
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,130
I love that. I predicted that.

209
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,760
And so I'd written, I have a headless chrome browser that implements the full

210
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,280
javascript and everything to extract a single piece of text from your profile.

211
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:14,919
So I can validate your email address.

212
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:15,210
And,

213
00:09:15,219 --> 00:09:19,570
and here's what's funny is most of the API S and these services exist

214
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,349
because they got sick of people scraping

215
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:24,104
their sites and like destroying their bandwidth.

216
00:09:24,114 --> 00:09:24,494
Whereas

217
00:09:24,705 --> 00:09:28,515
like you can make an API call that pulls in a couple of bytes or you can load

218
00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:32,544
a website that like three megabytes of crap and puts a huge load on the back end.

219
00:09:32,554 --> 00:09:33,304
And I hate to say it.

220
00:09:33,315 --> 00:09:36,344
But from my perspective, I don't really care, I just need that email address.

221
00:09:36,594 --> 00:09:36,965
Well, no,

222
00:09:36,974 --> 00:09:40,385
the person on the receiving side doesn't care if they're scraping

223
00:09:40,395 --> 00:09:44,924
or using an API API S were created for the services to

224
00:09:45,114 --> 00:09:48,164
basically control their, their loading costs.

225
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:50,664
-- Well, originally,
-- not just that

226
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:52,520
but to allow

227
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:55,530
people to extend it because here's the thing.

228
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:59,669
-- Hold on,
-- stop. Not yet. Not yet. Let's, I wanna, I wanna cover something else first.

229
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:00,570
So

230
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:05,719
Twitter and Reddit kind of lock down these API S and they start charging for them.

231
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,539
They didn't lock them down, they turned them off.

232
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:10,159
Well, they, they didn't turn them off, they're charging for them, right?

233
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:11,840
And they're charging quite a lot of money.

234
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:14,559
-- That's functionally the same as turning it off. OK,
-- whatever.

235
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,080
And, but here's the thing,

236
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,539
the people who are using these API S are not the kind of people you often want to

237
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,070
kind of push out of your ecosystem.

238
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,570
-- Well,
-- they're the people that literally build the ecosystem

239
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,419
in social media. Yes. Without people, you don't have social media.

240
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,460
I mean, I think Reddit's learning that

241
00:10:32,659 --> 00:10:36,200
the people that use the third party Twitter clients are literally the people

242
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,520
that are posting massive amounts of

243
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:40,169
content and moderating content and providing feedback

244
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:45,460
and especially on Reddit, like all the mods, you, you cannot use reddit

245
00:10:45,989 --> 00:10:47,570
with the default client and website.

246
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:48,140
It's

247
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,750
not good. No,

248
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:50,539
no,

249
00:10:50,729 --> 00:10:52,659
no, you can't. It is

250
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,909
impossible. There's stuff that's missing.

251
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,409
That's fair. That's fair.

252
00:10:56,599 --> 00:10:59,969
But here's so, here's, here's what amuses me about all this though. Right?

253
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,489
Is those people they

254
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:03,659
have found it,

255
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:06,260
I guess, easy to pick up and leave,

256
00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:09,940
which I love because if you look at Mastodon,

257
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,229
a lot of the people who migrated to Mastodon right away,

258
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,919
they were the heavy lifters on Twitter.

259
00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:19,239
And Mastodon has like in, in the security space, especially

260
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:20,099
there,

261
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:24,460
like the whole community basically just picked up and left and it was phenomenal.

262
00:11:24,469 --> 00:11:26,799
-- I loved it.
-- Well, and here's the trick is

263
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:31,299
you kind of have three main groups, you have the content producers,

264
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:32,479
the content

265
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:34,559
moderators and ma and community

266
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,739
managers effectively that enforce community norms

267
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,799
and the content consumers.

268
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,369
And they're broadly speaking, three separate groups of people.

269
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,700
Yes, obviously, there are people that are in all three groups, blah, blah, blah.

270
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,590
If one of those groups leaves or opts out largely,

271
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:50,169
then the whole thing just sort of falls apart

272
00:11:50,849 --> 00:11:52,179
and especially

273
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:56,450
and OK, and if the, if the content creators leave, then obviously have a problem,

274
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,400
there's no new content, it's boring.

275
00:11:58,799 --> 00:11:59,190
But

276
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:02,739
what's kind of insidious is the content moderators can leave and it,

277
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:08,229
it works for a few days or a few weeks until the not so nice people start coming in

278
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,179
and doing bad stuff to monetize community or to post

279
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,049
horrible stuff or to take advantage of it or whatever,

280
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,419
like apparently on Reddit, there's a whole bunch of companies that have already,

281
00:12:18,429 --> 00:12:18,859
or,

282
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:22,510
you know, been using reddit essentially to do, for example, like market research,

283
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,640
like, apparently only fans was watching the various subs that post, you know,

284
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,330
where people post pictures of themselves to, you know, am I hot or not?

285
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:31,580
And then like the ones that are hot get

286
00:12:31,989 --> 00:12:35,099
offered to become only fans content creator. Clever.

287
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:36,780
Right. Exactly. Well,

288
00:12:36,909 --> 00:12:37,419
I mean,

289
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:38,859
yeah, like,

290
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,780
it's a no brainer, right? There's your market research

291
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:44,049
and, you know, they've already got a following.

292
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,679
So

293
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,400
what really the, the thing is

294
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:51,239
when you especially lose the sort of community content moderators,

295
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:53,619
the con the community

296
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:55,690
becomes very toxic and gross

297
00:12:55,969 --> 00:12:58,859
nowadays. Very fast. It used to take months or years

298
00:12:59,349 --> 00:13:00,460
now. It's like days or wish,

299
00:13:00,909 --> 00:13:04,090
like I look at Twitter and like you read the studies of like the amount of

300
00:13:04,099 --> 00:13:06,140
right wing and fascist stuff being posted there

301
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,580
and just being allowed and it's like,

302
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:10,109
well, I guess it's, that's how it is now,

303
00:13:10,469 --> 00:13:10,909
right?

304
00:13:11,229 --> 00:13:13,099
They're not taking stuff down anymore because, well,

305
00:13:13,109 --> 00:13:14,630
they fired all the teams that did that.

306
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:15,640
No.

307
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,429
Right.

308
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,349
I know they did. Well, I mean, Reddit kind of just did too.

309
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:23,309
It's just theirs are volunteers and they got them for free.

310
00:13:23,609 --> 00:13:24,969
So, anyway, anyway, OK. OK.

311
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:29,070
I want to, I want to back all this up because I think we're, we're too focused on,

312
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,859
on API S in this context.

313
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,599
And the other thing is API S

314
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:36,349
allow people to build something

315
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,260
new and interesting that

316
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,210
makes it better.

317
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,950
It maybe integrates with another service or it does spell check or whatever.

318
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,250
But it's subtle because sometimes the companies are like, oh,

319
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,020
that's a cool feature.

320
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:51,020
Let's make that part of the default and some of them do it nicely.

321
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,099
-- And ok,
-- there, right there. Stop.

322
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:57,419
That is the purpose of this discussion that I wanted to cover is that

323
00:13:57,809 --> 00:13:59,260
when I am

324
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:05,390
the consumer of an API from a company like Twitter or Reddit or Facebook or anybody,

325
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:08,530
you are functionally at their mercy.

326
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:11,530
And this is what I think makes this whole universe so interesting.

327
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:13,580
Like from a from a risk perspective,

328
00:14:13,849 --> 00:14:18,200
it is very risky basing what you do on their API

329
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,789
because like the Apollo app for Reddit is a great example,

330
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:21,070
right?

331
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,140
The Apollo app was I I know that the developer was

332
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,320
not making a living off of this by any means,

333
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,500
but it's an example of Reddit basically said,

334
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,700
if you're going to keep making this app, you have to pay us $20 million a year.

335
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,460
And the Apollo guy was like, I can't possibly do that.

336
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:38,140
We're not going to go into that, but it's actually worse than that because the,

337
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:41,570
the way people use Apollo pricing, it would have been a complete impossibility.

338
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,070
But anyways

339
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,299
to back it up a second,

340
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,299
it's not that basing your business on a company's API is dangerous.

341
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,130
It's basing your business

342
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,780
on another thing that a single company controls

343
00:14:52,789 --> 00:14:54,559
is dangerous because let's back it up steps.

344
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:58,510
For example, if you sell through Amazon on their marketplace,

345
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,940
guess what happens if you have a really popular product?

346
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,539
All of a sudden, Amazon basics shows up.

347
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:05,280
Yeah. Right.

348
00:15:05,289 --> 00:15:07,299
They've done that more than once or actually, I,

349
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:09,919
I heard a story on public radio here in the US.

350
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:11,780
Uh, it's been maybe a year or more

351
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:12,559
but,

352
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,979
you know, the people who deliver for Amazon, right.

353
00:15:14,989 --> 00:15:17,380
Those Amazon vans and trucks you see driving around.

354
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,909
Do you mean the Amazon ones or the outsourced? Like in telecom ones?

355
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,440
Well, the, the, the outsource they're all outsourced, aren't they?

356
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:25,000
-- I think they're all outsourced.
-- Some are more outsourced than

357
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:25,380
ok.

358
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:25,929
Well, anyway,

359
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,659
they were basically talking about this person in Boston who created a

360
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:33,960
company basically to deliver Amazon stuff and for something happened that,

361
00:15:33,969 --> 00:15:36,599
that Amazon got mad at him and they were like, you're done,

362
00:15:36,609 --> 00:15:38,400
we're canceling your contract and like

363
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,289
that was it, there was no more.

364
00:15:40,299 --> 00:15:42,460
This guy didn't have a business,

365
00:15:42,469 --> 00:15:47,140
he only delivered for Amazon and when they cut him off with no warning because Amazon

366
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:50,059
-- like that was it, his company was over.
-- A lot of businesses

367
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,239
will cut suppliers off with no warning.

368
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,590
-- I
-- mean, that could be, I don't really understand that universe very well,

369
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:56,929
-- but part of
-- it is,

370
00:15:57,299 --> 00:15:58,760
but Amazon scale.

371
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:01,039
Oh, we lost one

372
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,400
supplier, providing package delivery.

373
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:06,580
-- Oh,
-- they, they, they had, they probably had another one lined up

374
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,770
ready to go.

375
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,030
Well, they already have more.

376
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:12,000
See the thing to remember is Amazon is operating on a scale

377
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,460
where they use statistical modeling and forecasting.

378
00:16:14,729 --> 00:16:15,359
Sure. It's,

379
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:19,369
it's nothing personal. It's not you. It's just a perfect example.

380
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,880
I remember 20 some years ago,

381
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:21,690
Suncor

382
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,229
and Syncrude, they're big oil companies locally, they had

383
00:16:24,669 --> 00:16:26,890
massive spreadsheets for all of their equipment.

384
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,150
And essentially when this equipment starts breaking at this level and this rate

385
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,580
it's surplused.

386
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:34,739
And so for example, people were always like, oh man, Suncor and Syncrude,

387
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,510
they sell all these used pickup trucks so cheap.

388
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:37,390
And

389
00:16:37,669 --> 00:16:40,489
like one of our I I was working for an electro like

390
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,809
an industrial electrical contractor back then that worked with these companies.

391
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,440
And they're like, yeah,

392
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,750
don't buy them because basically when sin crude or

393
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,359
Suncorp says that this equipment like we're selling it off

394
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:50,109
like

395
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:54,270
it's statistically, it's now into the nightmare mode of maintenance.

396
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,320
I have

397
00:16:55,429 --> 00:16:55,450
no

398
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,840
doubt they've extracted

399
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:59,789
like they have literally extracted every drop of

400
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:02,049
value from that piece of equipment for sure,

401
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:02,630
for sure.

402
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,869
And now it's, it's

403
00:17:03,969 --> 00:17:05,030
a, it's a negative thing

404
00:17:05,588 --> 00:17:07,398
again, back to these API S that's

405
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:11,979
companies that are smart, provide API s realizing that OK,

406
00:17:12,108 --> 00:17:16,130
Slack is a good example. Slack makes it easy to integrate stuff with Slack.

407
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:16,790
So what's happened?

408
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,930
Well, everybody uses Slack as their message bus with everything else tied in.

409
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,780
Same thing with Microsoft teams. Microsoft is trying to do this.

410
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,868
And this is for example,

411
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:28,029
um like what Zapp year does like they allow

412
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:30,918
you to integrate different services and smart services go

413
00:17:31,249 --> 00:17:33,879
not only do we provide an API but we'll we'll set it up.

414
00:17:33,889 --> 00:17:37,029
So it's easy to do in Zap year so that it just works and it's easy

415
00:17:37,168 --> 00:17:39,448
because now for example, people like Kurt go, yes,

416
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,229
let's buy this service because this service will

417
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:42,659
integrate with all of our existing stuff.

418
00:17:42,668 --> 00:17:43,649
So perfect example is

419
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:46,088
we use Zendesk for um help support,

420
00:17:46,639 --> 00:17:47,409
right? Sure.

421
00:17:47,889 --> 00:17:51,499
We're not going to use their api uh sorry, their A I for answering tickets

422
00:17:51,649 --> 00:17:52,848
for one simple reason,

423
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,550
I can only use it in Zendesk

424
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,949
so I can put all this effort into learning how to

425
00:17:57,959 --> 00:18:00,530
use their A I product and answer tickets and solve problems.

426
00:18:01,069 --> 00:18:03,150
And I can only use it in Zendesk or

427
00:18:03,609 --> 00:18:07,150
I can build an integration using ZAP here and open A is chat GP T

428
00:18:07,589 --> 00:18:08,829
to answer our support tickets.

429
00:18:09,459 --> 00:18:14,390
And now I can apply that knowledge and that system to do something else.

430
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:15,790
I mean, that's fair,

431
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:16,890
that's fair. See,

432
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:17,849
and

433
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:19,709
I'm of the mind where I would rather,

434
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:22,050
I would rather pick one vendor that solves multiple,

435
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:24,150
multiple problems than

436
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,229
you know, pay ZSK I and have that silo thing. And then,

437
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,109
oh, well, we want to use that knowledge and that training in another thing.

438
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:35,709
-- Uh We can't,
-- that's always the dream, right? Of, of one thing to, to rule them all.

439
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:40,390
If I end up using one A I provided by each service,

440
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,550
I'm going to have 20 different A is and that has a high cost

441
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,349
and this is where this is the whole point of API S is.

442
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,150
For example,

443
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,160
you can uh perfect example,

444
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:54,300
Red hat makes software management products that use API S in VM Ware, for example,

445
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:57,160
to control VM Ware through a single red hat product.

446
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:01,020
-- I want to back you up because you just said this is the point of API
-- S.

447
00:19:01,209 --> 00:19:02,380
Well, it's one of the points

448
00:19:02,949 --> 00:19:07,020
I have been thinking about this a lot and I think from the risk perspective,

449
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:10,260
so you hit your wagon to someone like Reddit or Twitter, we'll say,

450
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:14,079
and they're just good examples because they will say, behave badly recently.

451
00:19:14,349 --> 00:19:14,859
And

452
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,949
I just keep thinking that the initial purpose of

453
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:22,349
those API S was kind of enablement and empowerment,

454
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:24,650
right to, to help people do better things.

455
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:26,739
And something happened

456
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:29,699
where they decided we're going to try to make

457
00:19:29,709 --> 00:19:33,150
money off of this thing instead of viewing it as

458
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,630
a way to help people

459
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,680
do more and better with our product.

460
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:42,670
-- And I find that a fascinating occurrence. So
-- Corey Dr

461
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:44,819
has written extensively about this and it's the Ancid

462
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:48,510
education process and basically it boils down to a company

463
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:50,310
has something of value

464
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:51,689
that they realize.

465
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:52,550
Oh, we could

466
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,310
extract that value. We can keep that value, we can monetize that value.

467
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,030
Well, duh, let's do that.

468
00:19:59,439 --> 00:19:59,939
So,

469
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:01,609
and also to back it up a second.

470
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:03,209
I,

471
00:20:03,939 --> 00:20:07,989
it's not that Twitter has an api, it's that if you want to do social media,

472
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,439
your choices are Facebook, Twitter, Reddit.

473
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,400
What else? That's it.

474
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:13,729
I

475
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:18,459
-- mean, for the big companies, maybe linkedin, I don't know. Does that count?
-- No?

476
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:18,719
Well,

477
00:20:18,729 --> 00:20:21,410
like if you want to actually like post pictures of cats

478
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,680
and somehow monetize that and make a business off that,

479
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:25,150
right?

480
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,349
You got to post it to Facebook or edit or Twitter.

481
00:20:27,619 --> 00:20:28,989
That's fair. And so

482
00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:34,689
it's more about you're not so much tied to the API you're tied to that company.

483
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:35,739
And so the FTA

484
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,369
is a good example of if you want to do Mastodon,

485
00:20:38,949 --> 00:20:40,780
well, you can use somebody else's server,

486
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:42,500
you could set up your own server.

487
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,869
And as long as you're not a total jerk or using a total jerk servers,

488
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,560
you're probably not going to get defer

489
00:20:47,689 --> 00:20:49,760
and blocked from everybody else's servers.

490
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,790
But it's biased nature. It's currently

491
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,709
mostly decentralized now.

492
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:57,824
It will centralized because simple economics says again,

493
00:20:57,834 --> 00:20:59,005
there will be value there.

494
00:20:59,035 --> 00:21:00,905
Companies will move in and try and capture it.

495
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:01,635
And then the coy

496
00:21:01,744 --> 00:21:03,084
doctoral process of in shit

497
00:21:03,224 --> 00:21:04,285
education will happen where

498
00:21:04,425 --> 00:21:05,494
they intentionally

499
00:21:05,675 --> 00:21:08,895
or unintentionally give away value, get people hooked in.

500
00:21:08,905 --> 00:21:10,354
So, Amazon is a great example. Hey,

501
00:21:10,694 --> 00:21:13,275
do you want to set up your own online store or just sell through us and have

502
00:21:13,285 --> 00:21:15,015
delivery through us and prime delivery through us

503
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:16,814
and your customers will be so much happier.

504
00:21:16,824 --> 00:21:18,444
Well, obviously, number two

505
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:19,864
and then Amazon

506
00:21:20,435 --> 00:21:22,604
gets you in and start jacking up the fees.

507
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:24,255
What are you gonna do? Leave?

508
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:27,930
No, no, you're not. And worse if you're actually really successful.

509
00:21:27,939 --> 00:21:30,880
Like, for example, I bought some uh gray bed sheets.

510
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,260
They were nice

511
00:21:32,689 --> 00:21:34,310
and then I went to buy them a year later

512
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,959
and it recommended Amazon basics, exact same, basically description,

513
00:21:38,969 --> 00:21:39,979
everything I ordered them.

514
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:43,640
And what's fascinating is they were exactly the same as the previous bedsheets.

515
00:21:43,849 --> 00:21:46,979
However, the packaging was smaller, there was less packaging.

516
00:21:46,989 --> 00:21:48,479
They'd basically been optimized.

517
00:21:49,219 --> 00:21:49,800
They've been

518
00:21:49,979 --> 00:21:54,699
optimized for cost and for pa and a whole bunch of like subtle things that probably

519
00:21:54,709 --> 00:21:58,160
shaved a buck or two off the cost of producing this thing and shipping it,

520
00:21:58,219 --> 00:21:58,689
which on a

521
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,959
-- matter at their
-- scale, a buck is a big deal. All right.

522
00:22:02,209 --> 00:22:04,119
So here's the question, right.

523
00:22:05,229 --> 00:22:07,020
I'm a company

524
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,599
and you can't exist anymore outside of

525
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:13,390
this whole ecosystem of everything around us.

526
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:13,819
Right?

527
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,140
How do I

528
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,189
make sure, like from a risk perspective,

529
00:22:19,489 --> 00:22:21,349
how do I make sure I'm not

530
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:26,420
basically creating an unacceptable level of risk by being overly reliant

531
00:22:26,569 --> 00:22:29,109
on one mega company's stuff.

532
00:22:29,709 --> 00:22:31,489
-- You can't always do that.
-- I

533
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,670
-- don't
-- know if you can. I've been thinking about this a lot.

534
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,959
-- I've got nothing.
-- No, there, there's just industries where that's not possible.

535
00:22:39,369 --> 00:22:42,349
Um If you build nuclear reactors for example,

536
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:44,910
you don't have a lot of customers if you're Lockheed Martin

537
00:22:45,229 --> 00:22:46,849
and you build fighter jets.

538
00:22:47,349 --> 00:22:47,770
Like

539
00:22:48,689 --> 00:22:51,170
not only do you not have a lot of customers but the US government is gonna be like,

540
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,689
we don't care if you want to sell them to random country.

541
00:22:53,699 --> 00:22:54,569
We said no,

542
00:22:55,489 --> 00:22:57,839
like you can't sell the F-35 to

543
00:22:58,099 --> 00:22:58,680
China.

544
00:22:58,949 --> 00:23:01,760
Like you just can't, I don't care how many they want to buy.

545
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,709
Right.

546
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:07,550
And that's the thing like at some point, this is a business risk that you, you,

547
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,219
I'm a contractor.

548
00:23:09,619 --> 00:23:11,579
I have a contract with the Cloud Security Alliance.

549
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,410
That's it.

550
00:23:13,579 --> 00:23:14,410
I that's

551
00:23:15,189 --> 00:23:17,760
if they cease to exist, I don't get to eat this month

552
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,329
until you get a new job. Right?

553
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,050
And

554
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:22,410
true.

555
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:23,770
So sometimes like

556
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,890
part of it is, for example,

557
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:30,380
some companies and suppliers will have very long term healthy relationships.

558
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,219
Like I heard examples that electrical contractor I work for,

559
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,550
they had been working for some of these country

560
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,979
uh companies for like over a decade or two

561
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:42,180
and essentially were on the preferred supplier list of essentially,

562
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:44,579
unless you bid some ridiculous number

563
00:23:44,939 --> 00:23:46,130
will pay you to do it.

564
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,880
Or in some cases, they were so tightly enmeshed with the company,

565
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:51,660
they were just working on a cost plus basis of

566
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:54,140
essentially this plus 10% is what we pay you.

567
00:23:54,859 --> 00:23:56,510
And it was such a massive amount of work.

568
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,689
We're talking like 2, 300 electricians on site

569
00:23:58,949 --> 00:23:59,040
at

570
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:02,170
that scale again, you know, the company is like, yeah,

571
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,449
that plus 10% cool we can live with that.

572
00:24:05,329 --> 00:24:05,750
Um

573
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,010
And

574
00:24:08,699 --> 00:24:12,050
yeah, I mean, that's just a risk for a lot of companies. Like if you do delivery

575
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:15,130
for one company and that one company decides to fire you.

576
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,410
Yeah, that, that's unfortunate.

577
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,859
But part of it too, like if, for example,

578
00:24:18,869 --> 00:24:24,209
if you make a product that manages virtual machine software environments

579
00:24:24,459 --> 00:24:25,930
you're gonna support VM Ware,

580
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:31,489
maybe virtual box, maybe Red hat KVM. If you decide to be really nice.

581
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:33,219
And what are your other options?

582
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:34,770
Oh, Kubernetes, I guess,

583
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:39,300
I mean, for on Prem, you can also so a lot of those products now

584
00:24:39,449 --> 00:24:40,439
-- and then cloud
-- stuff

585
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:43,010
will integrate. Yeah, with like cloud and on Prem

586
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:44,040
and they give you

587
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:47,530
kind of a nicer opportunity. But I mean, you, you do have a point like,

588
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,189
yeah,

589
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,520
and for whatever reason if Amazon or VM Ware really decided to

590
00:24:51,604 --> 00:24:53,584
somehow legally lock you out or have a fight with you.

591
00:24:53,594 --> 00:24:54,344
Well, tough.

592
00:24:54,834 --> 00:24:55,885
Well, and, and I mean,

593
00:24:55,895 --> 00:24:59,305
Amazon has done this more than once where there was a company

594
00:24:59,314 --> 00:25:04,064
providing a service and they basically just built it themselves in Aws and

595
00:25:04,214 --> 00:25:05,525
-- well, and
-- at some point though, like

596
00:25:06,025 --> 00:25:06,505
that's

597
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:07,905
I'm sorry, but that's,

598
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:09,619
that's ok.

599
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:13,400
Like just because you just because you provide a service doesn't now you

600
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:15,619
get to own that forever and nobody else gets to provide that.

601
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:20,750
No, no, I, I get that. But I think so, what you're talking about there,

602
00:25:21,109 --> 00:25:21,780
that's

603
00:25:21,989 --> 00:25:25,099
functionally, I think competition in the market.

604
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,449
But I think Red Hat and t not Red

605
00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:29,260
Reddit and Twitter.

606
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:34,380
-- That's a different story though.
-- So there's a great example of this is Walmart.

607
00:25:34,469 --> 00:25:36,260
There's a, uh, we'll have to find the pickle story,

608
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:39,750
but there's basically Walmart as a vendor to work with is apparently

609
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,369
a nightmare because they basically will squeeze every penny out of you

610
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,239
and then fire you randomly at some point. And so I've heard that before.

611
00:25:46,339 --> 00:25:47,910
So the Walmart Pickle story.

612
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,349
Yeah. Anyways, wow, it's 20 years old now. Holy cow that goes back away.

613
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:52,369
But the point is

614
00:25:52,489 --> 00:25:53,739
there are vendors that are

615
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:55,380
mature enough,

616
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:58,349
I guess that when Walmart comes to them and says we really want to buy your product,

617
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:58,770
they go,

618
00:25:58,939 --> 00:25:59,479
no,

619
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:03,170
like just no, because we know how this will end.

620
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:06,310
And it's kind of the scorpion and the frog in that.

621
00:26:06,969 --> 00:26:08,199
It's not personal.

622
00:26:08,209 --> 00:26:10,989
It's just, this is how big business is you're going to try and extract all that value.

623
00:26:12,329 --> 00:26:12,910
Ok.

624
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,459
But,

625
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,500
but in the case of Twitter and Reddit,

626
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,660
they're hurting themselves.

627
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,500
They've done.

628
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,920
But here's, here's what I wonder though.

629
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:27,689
And here's maybe the closing discussion point is,

630
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,969
I'm pretty sure Reddit did what they did because they're

631
00:26:30,979 --> 00:26:33,489
hoping to suck money out of the A I people.

632
00:26:33,609 --> 00:26:35,739
Well, actually, no, it's more the IP O thing.

633
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:39,030
They're trying to IP O and they're trying to juice the numbers.

634
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:43,270
I know they wanted to IP 00. And you think that the, the, it was strictly about

635
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,189
revenue?

636
00:26:44,459 --> 00:26:44,880
Yeah.

637
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:49,010
-- Got to show recurring revenue. Got that, that line got to go up into the
-- right.

638
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,510
I mean, maybe that it could be that simple. That seems overly dumb to me.

639
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,390
But that might be it.

640
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,130
I mean,

641
00:26:54,469 --> 00:26:54,780
because

642
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,930
overly dumb,

643
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:58,180
well, no company would ever do something overly

644
00:26:58,359 --> 00:26:58,680
fair.

645
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:03,030
And I think, I think in the case of, of Twitter from everything I've heard, they,

646
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,910
they, they got a huge hit from their revenue and they thought

647
00:27:06,349 --> 00:27:09,890
they could just raise prices on the API S and,

648
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,989
and recover that and it doesn't look like that's true either.

649
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,420
Traditionally, large companies

650
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:17,489
had a board of directors

651
00:27:17,699 --> 00:27:18,329
and

652
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,880
A CEO

653
00:27:20,329 --> 00:27:23,380
that essentially wouldn't do irrational things.

654
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,810
They would be somewhat rational and predictable and sane

655
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,170
and that

656
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:28,810
is,

657
00:27:28,979 --> 00:27:31,770
and then perfect example, apparently

658
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:36,920
Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg are having a little Twitter thing about a cage fight.

659
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,020
You, you sent me that story there

660
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:42,979
and it's on the BBC. So because when I first saw this pop up, I was like, what? No.

661
00:27:42,989 --> 00:27:47,660
And then I'm like it links to the BBC. Oh my goodness. It might be real. Not the onion.

662
00:27:48,069 --> 00:27:51,660
Yeah. And then it links to the tweets where they're like going at each other.

663
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:53,660
I hope they do.

664
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,199
And the last, and I'm just going to remind you the last time Elon Musk started

665
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:00,239
basically talking big on Twitter.

666
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:03,959
He ended up having to buy it at an absurdly inflated price.

667
00:28:04,069 --> 00:28:07,119
Yeah. And it's worth pennies on the dollar now. Like,

668
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:11,180
I part of me hopes this happens because it's going

669
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,439
to be the most amusing event of the decade.

670
00:28:14,699 --> 00:28:18,280
Zuckerberg has been training jujitsu. Like he's actually,

671
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,089
yeah, they, they said that on,

672
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:23,439
-- on the BBC article
-- that I've seen video of him fighting.

673
00:28:23,449 --> 00:28:25,540
-- He's, he's reasonably competent.
-- Is he? Well,

674
00:28:25,869 --> 00:28:27,930
Musk has no training in the space. So

675
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:28,680
50

676
00:28:29,089 --> 00:28:30,329
year old out of shape guy.

677
00:28:31,239 --> 00:28:36,109
Uh, yes. Right. He's 52 I think he said, and Zuckerberg is in his thirties, 39

678
00:28:36,229 --> 00:28:36,910
or something. Ok.

679
00:28:37,089 --> 00:28:37,520
That's

680
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,219
as an, as an aged gentleman.

681
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:43,780
There's a big difference between 10 years

682
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:46,260
-- and
-- somebody who's been training and somebody who's not.

683
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,079
That's true too. That's very true.

684
00:28:48,089 --> 00:28:50,579
I've seen some scary looking 70 year olds when I was doing.

685
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,500
-- That's a good
-- point.

686
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,290
That's a good point.

687
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:56,849
-- Like that's fair. That's fair.
-- Anyways, no, this whole thing, the problem is

688
00:28:57,239 --> 00:29:01,900
the API is a technical thing that will always be beholden to the business interests.

689
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:05,569
So there is no amount of technical protection or like, oh, well,

690
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:07,500
very cleverly include a Blockchain.

691
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,459
So blah, blah, blah. No, it doesn't matter.

692
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,439
There will always be the business interests

693
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:16,160
assuming that API is done through a site being run by a business

694
00:29:16,729 --> 00:29:19,920
and those business interests will always say something like, hey,

695
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:23,640
remember how open a I said that they grabbed all our data and used it to

696
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:27,119
train an A I model that they then managed to get $10 billion of funding for.

697
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:28,920
I would like some of that cake, please.

698
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:32,280
Well, now here's actually, here's the ending thought on this.

699
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:35,060
If you look at what's happening at Reddit,

700
00:29:35,569 --> 00:29:38,170
all Reddit has to do is shut up

701
00:29:38,689 --> 00:29:40,250
and they can't, they can't.

702
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,380
-- And that's what I think makes it the most amusing.
-- Again.

703
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:47,290
The problem is you're saying Reddit when you should be saying SPZ

704
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,069
because Spz

705
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,890
is at the helm driving the boat and apparently he's not listening to reason,

706
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,410
just like Elon Musk with Twitter.

707
00:29:53,969 --> 00:29:56,390
That, that, yeah, that's, and that's part of the thing, right?

708
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,030
Like a normal large company, the CEO,

709
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:02,390
the board would directly call the CEO or have legal,

710
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,000
call the CEO or the CFO would talk to the CEO or say something and be like, you know,

711
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:06,089
like,

712
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,060
and they'd be like, oh, right. Oops.

713
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,670
Or be like, you don't work here anymore because you're obviously an idiot.

714
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,709
Well, no, no, no, he's just, he's decided to take more time with his family.

715
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,969
-- That
-- right. Yes, of course,

716
00:30:17,979 --> 00:30:19,640
nobody ever does that. No. Cor

717
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,510
by definition, if you're a CEO, you don't like your family.

718
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,420
-- I
-- mean, that's probably fair. They probably don't like you. But

719
00:30:26,229 --> 00:30:28,979
-- that's not true. I know some CEO S that have lovely families.
-- But,

720
00:30:29,199 --> 00:30:30,650
well, I'm talking to like mega CEO.

721
00:30:30,949 --> 00:30:33,390
-- Si get what you're saying. That's probably fair
-- CEO s of these

722
00:30:33,579 --> 00:30:33,979
like,

723
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,229
and that's part of the thing is,

724
00:30:35,239 --> 00:30:37,719
I think part of it to become the CEO and stay

725
00:30:37,729 --> 00:30:39,939
the CEO of some of these like large start up,

726
00:30:39,949 --> 00:30:42,670
you kind of have to be a villain because

727
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,260
there's 100 people that would love to have your job

728
00:30:46,369 --> 00:30:48,510
and we will cheerfully put you in a tree chipper to get it.

729
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:48,930
Yeah.

730
00:30:48,939 --> 00:30:51,079
And I guess at this point if Reddit could, like,

731
00:30:51,089 --> 00:30:54,829
just shut up and stop burning down the house, they would have done it weeks ago

732
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:57,030
and they obviously can't and won't.

733
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:57,910
And

734
00:30:58,349 --> 00:30:58,699
I, the,

735
00:30:58,839 --> 00:30:58,959
the,

736
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:04,229
-- the IP O ship just keep sailing further away.
-- I predict what will happen is

737
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:08,160
the mods won't back down. So Reddit will replace a bunch of mods,

738
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:11,510
-- which they've replaced a ton of them already
-- and things like our

739
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,770
picks will sort of soldier along. But

740
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:18,300
the people who will want to become mods are not becoming mods because they're

741
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:21,939
nice kind altruistic people who want to see a better ARP picks community,

742
00:31:22,199 --> 00:31:27,140
they're going to do it to try and monetize or somehow push other agendas. Right.

743
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:27,619
Right.

744
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,939
I imagine

745
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:31,310
there's a bunch of countries with a bunch of disinformation

746
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:34,239
efforts right now that are working hard to be moderators,

747
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,439
you know, and steer those conversations and steer those, you know,

748
00:31:37,449 --> 00:31:38,680
public opinion things

749
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,140
and, um, Reddit's not going to die,

750
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:44,839
but it's going to become kind of a grosser and grosser place like Twitter did.

751
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:45,979
Yeah, for sure.

752
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:47,020
The thing is though,

753
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:49,479
the people that are the users of it,

754
00:31:50,569 --> 00:31:51,709
they won't know what to do.

755
00:31:51,719 --> 00:31:51,869
Like,

756
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,339
it's not like dig to Reddit where there

757
00:31:53,349 --> 00:31:55,630
was a clear transition from one coming to another

758
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,770
because the Reddit to Mastodon transition

759
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,939
is so fundamentally different and weird.

760
00:31:59,969 --> 00:32:03,109
-- Not
-- Mastodon Cavin or Lemmy are the two options.

761
00:32:03,469 --> 00:32:05,949
Sorry. Yeah. Sorry. I meant, yeah, that's what I meant.

762
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:09,829
It is a lot different and like I, I won't lie. I'm loving it, but it's different.

763
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:11,829
-- I can't
-- even remember the names,

764
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:14,030
let alone how to get there and log in and get an account.

765
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,280
That's my point

766
00:32:15,439 --> 00:32:16,390
and I have an account

767
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,280
and I can't even remember.

768
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:21,180
So like a normal person is gonna be like, where's the app for this?

769
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,160
But here's the thing, here's the thing that I,

770
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:25,719
I think of it and I want to close on this point is

771
00:32:26,199 --> 00:32:26,750
the,

772
00:32:26,949 --> 00:32:31,310
the people who are most likely to run and moderate a community

773
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,729
are the people most capable of leaving and going somewhere else,

774
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:35,300
right?

775
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:38,479
The users who can't leave, they'll stick around for a while,

776
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:40,250
but they'll eventually turn it off because it's

777
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,199
going to turn into like the toxic trashy

778
00:32:42,859 --> 00:32:42,979
about

779
00:32:43,089 --> 00:32:43,750
Facebook and

780
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:45,400
Facebook

781
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:47,150
is different. Facebook

782
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:52,329
has a, a community aspect for planning and stuff. Look at Twitter, right?

783
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,180
How many people do you know? Still on Twitter?

784
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,520
Well, and more to the point nobody, you can't.

785
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:58,900
Facebook does have the family aspect where all your

786
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,800
old people are on Facebook and like you said,

787
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,810
the, the community kind of planning events,

788
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,500
-- I'll give you that. That is different.
-- I think that's its power

789
00:33:06,925 --> 00:33:10,824
because Twitter, I think lost its power because it lost a lot of the people who,

790
00:33:10,834 --> 00:33:12,994
who did the good work of making Twitter.

791
00:33:13,005 --> 00:33:13,564
Interesting. I'm

792
00:33:13,685 --> 00:33:15,704
-- actually
-- having to go back to Twitter because there's

793
00:33:15,714 --> 00:33:17,984
still people that will only post stuff on Twitter

794
00:33:18,194 --> 00:33:22,584
-- that's still quite high quality and interesting. I have,
-- I have not found any of them

795
00:33:22,885 --> 00:33:25,944
-- a
-- bunch. Like, and they just, they're not un mastered on Tooting away

796
00:33:26,219 --> 00:33:28,319
and that they aren't going to come to Mastodon at this point.

797
00:33:28,329 --> 00:33:30,469
-- If you haven't moved to Mastodon, I don't think they
-- will.

798
00:33:30,739 --> 00:33:31,250
They're gonna lose their,

799
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,800
their follower account is gonna go from like six

800
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:33,170
figure.

801
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:33,609
I

802
00:33:34,369 --> 00:33:34,619
think

803
00:33:34,719 --> 00:33:37,680
that's what keeps a lot of people like on Twitter is they,

804
00:33:37,689 --> 00:33:41,319
they're obsessed with that follower count and they, they don't want to start over

805
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,520
it. It's, it's gonna be similar with Reddit, right?

806
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:49,040
Where moving from a, a Reddit, a subreddit that had 3 million people.

807
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,430
And now the equivalent on Cain

808
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:51,890
has 2000.

809
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,400
Like that's a huge difference. But

810
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,380
again,

811
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,900
it's a different thing and I don't think

812
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,670
-- it's necessarily comparable
-- and that's another thing.

813
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,290
Maybe another show. But like

814
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,959
some of these subreddits,

815
00:34:02,329 --> 00:34:06,209
bird examples are slash picks. It's got a community of 30 million people.

816
00:34:06,219 --> 00:34:07,489
That's a large country.

817
00:34:07,869 --> 00:34:08,850
Yeah. It's ridiculous.

818
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:11,929
That's not a community anymore really. In the sense of,

819
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:12,790
like,

820
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:14,949
30 million people, man.

821
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,418
Right. Oh, for sure. Yeah.

822
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:19,949
Like, there aren't 30 million people on all of Mastodon, I don't think.

823
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:24,620
-- Well, more to
-- the 0.30 million people can't really coordinate or talk to each other.

824
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,500
Like, that's way past your dunbar number.

825
00:34:26,728 --> 00:34:27,070
Right

826
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,489
by a couple zeros.

827
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,300
So, and that's part of what I also wonder is, again, we're, we're,

828
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:36,800
we're lumping all these subreddits into sort of the Reddit bucket.

829
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:37,159
But

830
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:40,418
I mean, there are subreddits with 100 people and there are subreddits with

831
00:34:40,928 --> 00:34:43,799
well, 30 million people. I think, I don't know what the biggest one is.

832
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:47,039
It's number nine ranked by size if I click that

833
00:34:47,638 --> 00:34:48,069
one

834
00:34:48,539 --> 00:34:50,819
R slash 2050 million users. So there are,

835
00:34:50,928 --> 00:34:53,268
there are two subreddits that are bigger than Canada

836
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:55,868
and then a bunch that are about as big as Canada

837
00:34:56,268 --> 00:34:57,509
-- anyway
-- anyway.

838
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,989
Yeah. Yeah. I don't know.

839
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,659
It'll be,

840
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:02,030
it's funny because I have a suspicion from the time

841
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,350
we recorded until I hit publish on this episode.

842
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,350
There will be

843
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:09,949
many more ridiculous happenings in the Twitter or in the, in the Reddit saga.

844
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,429
-- But I guess we
-- shall see.

845
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,389
And here's and one note also that we ignored that I want to mention explicitly just

846
00:35:16,409 --> 00:35:21,459
API S are also really needed by people with disabilities like the

847
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:21,780
blind.

848
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:24,500
And that is one thing that really

849
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:27,550
does upset me and hurts me is that

850
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,870
Reddit is

851
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,709
largely unusable

852
00:35:32,219 --> 00:35:34,080
through the default app and website,

853
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:37,540
even if you are fully cited and fully capable. Like I,

854
00:35:37,979 --> 00:35:40,189
yeah, I use it through the default apps and stuff

855
00:35:40,409 --> 00:35:43,800
and it's kind of garbage and I cannot imagine how terrible it

856
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,449
would be to try and use it if you were blind.

857
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:47,050
And that's the other thing is API S

858
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:50,110
allow people with disabilities to interact with the site

859
00:35:50,939 --> 00:35:54,510
in ways that unless you are really committed to usability

860
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,959
and most tech companies are not,

861
00:35:58,209 --> 00:35:59,030
they're just not.

862
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,610
I won't disagree with that.

863
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,209
And that's, I kind of hope at some point.

864
00:36:04,219 --> 00:36:06,989
Somebody fires up like an ad, a suit in the US about this.

865
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,260
Uh Yeah,

866
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:14,290
I would not be sad to see that because we've already got ad a guidelines for websites

867
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:15,350
that are

868
00:36:16,439 --> 00:36:21,570
-- largely ignored by a lot of sites like alt takes for text or images. Sorry.
-- Right.

869
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,189
Alt text takes for images.

870
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,919
I, I, yes, I agree that that's a,

871
00:36:26,929 --> 00:36:30,139
that's a very good point and I hadn't even considered that aspect of it.

872
00:36:30,909 --> 00:36:34,070
