Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast

1
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,819
episode 146 with myself, Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime,

2
00:00:11,829 --> 00:00:12,560
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,510
What's new Kurt? Well,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,629
-- uh
-- I don't know how to say this but

5
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:19,719
Microsoft may not be the baddies anymore.

6
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:23,840
-- I would not call them
-- compared to where they were 20 years ago,

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,110
even 10 years ago,

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,739
maybe.

9
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:27,600
But I would agree.

10
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:33,090
I think from the context of open source, Microsoft is no longer the enemy,

11
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,599
which is weird to say.

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,919
-- And
-- so at a very high level, before we get into details,

13
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,150
there's all these people talking about these various topics with the classic.

14
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:43,119
What is it? Embrace extend and extinguish.

15
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,819
But I'll be blunt, like the amount of money they spent on github.

16
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,439
If they were to extinguish that

17
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,599
the problem is people would just move somewhere else.

18
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:56,599
They would. And I don't think they have any intention of extinguishing

19
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:01,439
github. It is a phenomenal resource. And in fact, if you look at the github

20
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,400
top contributors list that they publish once a year

21
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,120
and they just published it maybe a month ago.

22
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:08,839
Microsoft is number one by a generous lead

23
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:13,120
Yeah. Well, the other thing is too, people forget Microsoft also owns linkedin.

24
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:14,169
So between linkedin and

25
00:01:14,529 --> 00:01:18,410
if they can get those two things working together, that's pretty phenomenal.

26
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,949
-- They know everything about us.
-- Yes.

27
00:01:22,529 --> 00:01:22,569
So,

28
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:26,230
yeah. So, ok. Well, where do you even start? Ok.

29
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:28,250
Well, let's start with the really, obviously,

30
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:29,010
uh,

31
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,529
they're shipping a Linux kernel

32
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:34,830
in Windows, like, not shipping the Linux kernel that everybody does that, you know,

33
00:01:34,839 --> 00:01:37,519
if you do IOT stuff but no, like in Windows,

34
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:38,930
right? Boom.

35
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:40,690
Yeah,

36
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,720
exactly. Exactly.

37
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,889
Yeah. Like I remember when the Halloween memos came out and like

38
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,449
-- 20 years from now, I would know that. What?
-- No.

39
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,690
So actually,

40
00:01:53,699 --> 00:01:57,349
you know what this reminded me of and I looked it up this morning and it

41
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,849
was Linus Torvalds has a quote that says

42
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,129
when Microsoft start shipping apps on Linux,

43
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,569
I know I've won

44
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:07,230
like this is so far past that line of win. It's just

45
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,288
holy crap.

46
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:11,610
And what I was thinking about is is, it's, it's pretty clear

47
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:15,199
that Microsoft has been working towards this for a long time, obviously.

48
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:19,320
Um But even more so that because like when you like, for example,

49
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,160
Microsoft shipped SQL server

50
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,210
on Linux, like several years ago,

51
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,289
I have a t-shirt from them. Actually, it's quite nice

52
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:28,729
-- and
-- also.net

53
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:30,490
on Linux some years ago.

54
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:33,729
And, and what somebody pointed out to me is if you have to port something.

55
00:02:34,309 --> 00:02:37,009
First of all, if you write it for a platform you're probably screwed.

56
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,729
If you write it for two platforms,

57
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,610
you're probably like 80% of the way there of having it run everywhere.

58
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:47,160
And so by, you know, by having the, like, what's interesting is,

59
00:02:47,429 --> 00:02:47,449
I

60
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,869
mean, to me it makes sense, because.net and SQL Server, those two go hand in hand.

61
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,899
Like that's how companies build apps, like

62
00:02:54,149 --> 00:02:57,580
big boring apps that nobody ever sees, you know, that run in the back end.

63
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:58,649
And so by having

64
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:01,940
it kind of reminds me of um I think it was it Comcast or Verizon,

65
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:03,550
they wanted to deploy I PV six

66
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,580
and they picked their billing system to deploy

67
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:07,289
I PV six because it touches everything.

68
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,369
And that's also true of, you know, SQL server, and.net, right?

69
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:15,270
The SQL server and.net are so big and complex that if you can get those ported,

70
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,500
then number one, you've got them ported, which is cool.

71
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:19,369
But number two, you're going to gain so much

72
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,529
knowledge

73
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:21,410
about,

74
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:25,250
oh, you know, like when you do interrupts in windows this way,

75
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,210
you got to do them in Linux this other way,

76
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,289
except in this corner case because then everything tips over and like

77
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:31,880
dies or whatever, right?

78
00:03:32,695 --> 00:03:36,115
I'm assuming they have some massive internal knowledge base.

79
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:40,074
Now of like here's how you make things work on Linux without like blowing up, right?

80
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:43,645
Because the other thing to remember is these, these aren't like bad ports

81
00:03:43,794 --> 00:03:46,074
like these aren't like, oh, it's ported. It kind of works.

82
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:48,184
These are like, full functioning legit.

83
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:50,755
No, because there's gonna be support stuff and it's like,

84
00:03:50,845 --> 00:03:53,945
like some of those console ports of games where it's like, yeah, the game will run

85
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:55,565
for like, 12 seconds.

86
00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:04,000
Uh, even actually the Linux port of most games are atrociously bad where, I mean,

87
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:06,800
I've, I've had Linux ports, I've purchased

88
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,669
that.

89
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,080
Like,

90
00:04:08,089 --> 00:04:13,070
they only start 20% of the time and the rest of the time it just explodes and crash.

91
00:04:14,429 --> 00:04:15,809
It's sad.

92
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:21,238
-- Yeah. So,
-- ok. So I think they, and, and they've also done some other just cool stuff.

93
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,170
Like they've got a new windows terminal

94
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:24,779
and it's not that

95
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:25,910
I want,

96
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,600
I want to back up for one moment before we get to the

97
00:04:28,609 --> 00:04:33,329
terminal and just say we were discussing the Linux kernel being in windows and

98
00:04:33,809 --> 00:04:35,089
there's something really,

99
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:38,089
I guess unique about this that struck me when I learned

100
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,859
about it is so Microsoft has had what they call it.

101
00:04:40,869 --> 00:04:43,489
The, the Linux subsystem for windows, I think

102
00:04:43,739 --> 00:04:43,989
windows subsystem

103
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:44,730
for Linux

104
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,570
-- WSL.
-- Oh,

105
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,660
ok. Whatever.

106
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:49,579
That's fair.

107
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,059
But basically they've been able to run

108
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:57,329
certain Linux binaries kind of natively on windows for, I bet it's been, what,

109
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,579
three or four years, at least, maybe more.

110
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:02,910
And it worked well enough, but it wasn't quite right.

111
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,820
And I tried running a bunch of stuff like containers that work.

112
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:08,829
For example, there was a lot of when you try to run Java,

113
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:12,170
often you end up tripping over some weird CIS call

114
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:14,660
that wasn't implemented or you'd get back strange results.

115
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,510
That didn't make sense.

116
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,489
And, I mean,

117
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,279
it was obvious they had a significant investment into supporting

118
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,859
Linux applications on Windows by all this effort they did.

119
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,269
But I found it,

120
00:05:25,739 --> 00:05:27,040
I guess, intriguing

121
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:30,519
that rather than kind of continue down the path they were on,

122
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:32,839
somebody must have just stood up and been, like, screw it.

123
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,769
Let's just take the kernel and do that.

124
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:37,549
And the advantage though is now everything works.

125
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,190
Yeah.

126
00:05:38,299 --> 00:05:39,989
Well, it's actually a bit more subtle than that.

127
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,720
Somebody was pointing out on hacker news that when Satya Nadella came out,

128
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,670
uh, and took over Microsoft, that one of the things he did is he folded the,

129
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:49,390
the Windows team into,

130
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,829
uh, like another team. Like, basically there's no more like, how do I put it?

131
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,230
Windows isn't really a first class citizen at Microsoft anymore.

132
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:58,929
Azure is

133
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,679
and, you know, the cloud stuff is and the programming languages are,

134
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:05,109
but let's face it. The operating system. Who cares?

135
00:06:05,119 --> 00:06:07,869
Like I, yeah, you need one to run stuff, you know.

136
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,910
But in the same way that, like my,

137
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,690
my car engine has a bunch of parts that I don't know or care about.

138
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:16,549
I really don't, you know, I had to get a new alternator a few months ago.

139
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,109
And quite frankly, it's like,

140
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:21,230
you know, oh, I need a new alternator. Great. Ok. Replace it.

141
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:24,390
I didn't even ask what brand name it was. I don't care.

142
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,209
It, it alternates and makes electricity. Right. That's all you need.

143
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,290
And that's kind of where operating systems we call that a commodity.

144
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,790
Yeah. And that's kind of where operating systems are. It's like,

145
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,690
well, no, we wrote an accounting application. It needs to work reliably.

146
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,369
I don't care that it runs on.

147
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,079
So, or Linux or Windows,

148
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:45,970
I just need a platform that it will run reliably on for the next 10 years.

149
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:52,299
No, if, if anything runs on Sko, don't, don't run that, that's, that's a bad choice.

150
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,250
And more to the point that

151
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:56,760
that underlying platform now is more likely going

152
00:06:56,769 --> 00:06:58,489
to be something like Azure and not,

153
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,170
you know, a PC sitting in a closet, collecting dust somewhere in a small business or,

154
00:07:03,179 --> 00:07:04,140
or a data center.

155
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:05,179
That's a larger company.

156
00:07:05,549 --> 00:07:08,619
Absolutely. And, and I think this has been,

157
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,970
it's been obvious for a while that the operating system

158
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,489
is kind of becoming a commodity and in most cases,

159
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,070
it's Linux

160
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,359
and I have a strong suspicion,

161
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:21,670
Microsoft has known this forever and they know that at least by doing this,

162
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:24,070
they can maintain some level of relevance for

163
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,929
Windows that they potentially because let's face it,

164
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,230
man.

165
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:29,859
I bet five years ago, maybe even seven or to 10,

166
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:35,149
it was looking like windows wasn't in good shape for a long future, right?

167
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,670
Where it was just, it was becoming stodgy

168
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,790
windows vista

169
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:44,809
-- and 787 was Ok. Eight was a train wreck.
-- Eight was awful.

170
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,029
It was awful.

171
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,269
10 was better but

172
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:48,589
-- still.
-- Right.

173
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,029
And I remember there were a lot of people for a long time that were basically saying,

174
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,989
you know, Windows is done.

175
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,459
There's no future here anymore.

176
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:57,070
And I don't feel like I'm hearing that.

177
00:07:57,309 --> 00:08:01,750
Like I was, in fact, if anything, I think I'm hearing Mac Os might be done.

178
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:03,630
But that's another story.

179
00:08:03,769 --> 00:08:04,070
Yeah.

180
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,390
What, what's interesting to me is Microsoft is basically,

181
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:09,459
I think saying Windows is done

182
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,619
but not done.

183
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,989
Like it's dead but done in the sense of it just, it's commodity, it doesn't matter.

184
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,670
It's like your electricity.

185
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:20,480
-- Yes. Right.
-- Who cares? As long as it makes things go and work.

186
00:08:20,489 --> 00:08:20,970
That's right.

187
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,649
Turn on switch light, turns on everyone's happy.

188
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:24,329
Yeah.

189
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:24,970
So,

190
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,850
yeah. No. And I mean,

191
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:34,289
I think what will also happen is apparently.net will now

192
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:38,308
be able to build apps natively for and the list was quite long.

193
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,159
This isn't complete but it was I OS, it was Android,

194
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,500
it was Mac Os, it was Windows, it was Linux and a

195
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,010
couple other things.

196
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:47,799
So basically everything

197
00:08:47,909 --> 00:08:48,530
really.

198
00:08:49,859 --> 00:08:52,440
And so if I can actually build an app

199
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,809
with one tool chain, one code base

200
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,130
and support

201
00:08:56,309 --> 00:08:58,299
everything, that's pretty amazing.

202
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,179
It's like the promise of Java.

203
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:00,880
Yeah.

204
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:03,090
That's exactly it. Yeah.

205
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,099
Yeah. And, and as far as the embrace, extend extinct or embrace

206
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,940
it, embrace, extend, extinguish,

207
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:13,000
you embrace. Yes. Extend. Yes. But extinguish doesn't work anymore.

208
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,859
And I think Microsoft gets that there's more money to be made in

209
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:18,820
selling these tool chains and stuff than trying to kill off Linux. Because

210
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,150
the other thing I'm thinking of,

211
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,960
we know how much effort went into the Linux kernel just to make simple and by s well,

212
00:09:23,969 --> 00:09:28,780
not simple but like file IO you know, network io device drivers, all that stuff work.

213
00:09:28,979 --> 00:09:32,710
And Microsoft has to do all that work as well in house.

214
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:33,510
Right.

215
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,030
That's a huge cost, billions of dollars over years.

216
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,349
And if they can actually make the switch to

217
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:43,429
a Linux kernel natively with running windows on top,

218
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:43,859
which

219
00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:45,750
there's no technical reason they can't,

220
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:51,989
I would be shocked if that happens. Windows and Linux do some

221
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:56,330
things in very different ways on a very low level that could,

222
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,270
I'm not saying it's impossible, but I have a suspicion the,

223
00:09:59,549 --> 00:10:02,299
it is easier for them to make a Linux kernel run on

224
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:06,020
windows than it would be to kind of turn windows into Linux.

225
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:06,830
Right.

226
00:10:07,219 --> 00:10:08,979
Well, and the other problem is, I mean,

227
00:10:08,989 --> 00:10:11,320
they are aware of all the technical debt they have with

228
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:14,349
windows and the technical debt with Linux is something that's,

229
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,940
you know, that's a whole different ballpark and a whole different,

230
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,890
I mean, it's, it's pretty massive, but

231
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,049
at

232
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:20,960
this point,

233
00:10:20,969 --> 00:10:24,280
the fact that we're even discussing it and not just outright dismissing it

234
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:25,869
is kind of,

235
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:29,619
I agree. And, and here's the other thing

236
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,409
that

237
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,030
makes me excited and interested in

238
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,179
this

239
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:37,419
kind of New Microsoft will say is

240
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:40,020
for those of you who aren't old,

241
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:43,679
like curt and myself kind of starting in the early two thousands.

242
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,940
And even in the late 19 nineties,

243
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:49,099
I was about to say late 19 hundreds, which I guess is not wrong

244
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:49,890
but

245
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,380
not

246
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:51,549
make

247
00:10:51,789 --> 00:10:53,179
me sound older than I am.

248
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:53,809
But

249
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,719
in the late 19 nineties, early two thousands,

250
00:10:56,789 --> 00:11:02,010
Microsoft was getting their backsides handed to themselves because their

251
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:06,989
security was garbage and they treated security researchers as adversaries.

252
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:08,830
And honestly,

253
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,690
this is a very similar story to what we're seeing with Linux where it was basically,

254
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,440
we're going to fight you with everything we have.

255
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:17,039
And then one day they're like, hey, you're cool, come on in

256
00:11:17,369 --> 00:11:17,809
and,

257
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:19,989
and, and I mean, it was very much like that.

258
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,989
But anyway, due to Microsoft just getting like pummeled in the industry,

259
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:29,010
they have some really impressive security controls inside of windows itself that,

260
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,260
that even Linux doesn't have to a certain degree.

261
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,840
And I know that's always say, oh, Linux is more secure and

262
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:36,549
I'm not going to say it's more secure. I'm not going to say it's less secure.

263
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:37,770
I'm just going to say it's different.

264
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:41,380
And so I think if you can bring some of this stuff together, you know,

265
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:47,070
it's like our powers combined, we form whatever and, and I think it could leave a,

266
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,760
in some instances, a better situation.

267
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:54,799
But I'm still not gonna run Linux on Windows myself because I do, I do.

268
00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:57,140
There's a windows computer in the basement, the kids play games on.

269
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,880
But like, yeah, I'm not, I'm not running windows. So

270
00:12:00,099 --> 00:12:01,659
it's, it's an interesting thought though.

271
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:04,000
Well, I'm just thinking from a developer's point of view, man,

272
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,599
this makes their life so much easier

273
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:07,150
if they run windows.

274
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:07,859
Ah,

275
00:12:07,869 --> 00:12:11,789
now there's one other important thing we should specify is I would bet you

276
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:15,169
the vast majority of people who listen to us when we say developers,

277
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:19,219
they imagine like a dude in a coffee shop with maybe a Linux computer or a Mac.

278
00:12:19,229 --> 00:12:25,340
And the reality is like 99% of developers are people who go into a corporate office.

279
00:12:25,349 --> 00:12:27,239
They sit down at a Windows computer,

280
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:31,659
they do not have the ability to install software, they do their job and they go home.

281
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,539
Those people are going to experience

282
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,500
an incredible enlightenment from this.

283
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:41,000
But no, like people like us who just have like Linux computers, we schlep around

284
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,570
whatever we don't really care.

285
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,429
-- No,
-- it's, and I mean, speaking of this, the tools that they're gonna have,

286
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:49,979
what amazes me is not that Windows or Microsoft released a cool new terminal

287
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,580
but that they actually managed to make a video

288
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,630
of it that makes it look cool.

289
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,890
Uh It does actually, it does look very nice and for anyone who's ever run the,

290
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,289
what is it?

291
00:12:58,299 --> 00:12:59,039
Windows, subsys,

292
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,150
whatever the heck. It is

293
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,559
Windows subsystem for Linux.

294
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,460
Thank you.

295
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,260
Anyone who's ever run the old terminal. It was kind of a piece of crap.

296
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:10,059
-- It was basically like a glorified D OS prompt and you couldn't do a lot
-- with it.

297
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,169
It was 19 eighties.

298
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,229
Uh I

299
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,000
would

300
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:13,989
-- sure
-- that was

301
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:16,900
-- no tab completion. No. Right.
-- Right.

302
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:20,289
Well, no, no, you could get tab completion when you ran bash, for example,

303
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:20,909
in the terminal.

304
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,659
But it wasn't like there were no tabs.

305
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:27,659
It was a very one screen environment, it was copy and paste was weird.

306
00:13:27,669 --> 00:13:28,469
And, but anyway,

307
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:30,880
they kind of built a new terminal that interfaces

308
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,559
with all this stuff and it looks like a,

309
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:37,030
a terminal running on a souped up Linux distro, which is pretty sweet.

310
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,900
And here's what's most interesting to me. OK.

311
00:13:38,909 --> 00:13:41,900
But what about contributing to an existing open source terminal app project

312
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:42,409
said?

313
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:46,809
And this is, this is on microsoft.com, right? This is their official DEV blog thing.

314
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,989
So we carefully explored this option during planning

315
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,440
and determined our involvement in an existing project

316
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,890
would require changing the project's requirements and architecture

317
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,250
in ways that would be too disruptive.

318
00:13:55,429 --> 00:13:57,669
Yeah, that's probably a vast understatement

319
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,070
instead by creating a new open source

320
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,479
terminal application and open sourcing windows console.

321
00:14:02,489 --> 00:14:05,210
Oh, yeah. Did we mention that this terminal is open source? I don't think we did,

322
00:14:05,359 --> 00:14:05,919
but it's open

323
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,090
source. We did not again,

324
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,640
like,

325
00:14:09,289 --> 00:14:10,270
you know, I'm reminded of that.

326
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,340
Are we the baddies video, except in this case, it's like,

327
00:14:12,349 --> 00:14:17,000
-- is Microsoft the good guys
-- and, and in fact, so it's really funny as you said,

328
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,500
did we mention it's open source?

329
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:18,950
And

330
00:14:19,239 --> 00:14:19,510
it,

331
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,630
it never occurred to me in my brain to mention it

332
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,429
because I just assumed that would be an obvious fact.

333
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,190
But yeah, totally.

334
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:29,630
Yeah, this isn't the Microsoft 20 years ago. That's, that's pretty brutal.

335
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:32,250
And here's another one, here's a like it's, it's been a,

336
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,869
they've had a very busy day yesterday.

337
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:39,030
Microsoft is building their new Chromium edge browser.

338
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:43,109
Now I said Chromium edge, not Chromium but Chromium edge.

339
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:47,090
So they have their edge browser, which is as far as I understand it, a Flaming Turd

340
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:53,039
-- like most web browsers that are not chrome,
-- that's, that's a little harsh,

341
00:14:53,049 --> 00:14:55,750
it's not great, but it's not terrible.

342
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,270
It's no,

343
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,479
I'll say that.

344
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,289
Well,

345
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:58,559
yeah.

346
00:14:58,729 --> 00:15:01,330
So they're going to a chrome based web browser but you know,

347
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,890
Chrome and edge and they're building an explorer into it.

348
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,359
So they're essentially, you know,

349
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:07,210
I guess they understand again, you know,

350
00:15:07,219 --> 00:15:09,229
building a web browser are very nontrivial.

351
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:12,690
There's basically now two people doing it, you know, Chrome and Firefox, right?

352
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,619
And then there's a bunch of smaller players like safari and opera and whatnot.

353
00:15:15,909 --> 00:15:17,500
I I would like to point out

354
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,570
in the context of this though is the

355
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,760
real reason Microsoft started doing this is because

356
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:25,510
of just there have been multiple shenanigans pulled

357
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,380
by the large web properties that have made

358
00:15:28,869 --> 00:15:30,549
edge difficult for them.

359
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:32,780
And so it was kind of one of those,

360
00:15:32,789 --> 00:15:35,739
we're gonna stop doing it our way because you guys keep

361
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,340
screwing us over and we'll just take our stuff and,

362
00:15:38,349 --> 00:15:38,929
and do it

363
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,450
and it would not shock me to see Microsoft become

364
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:46,900
the la the largest contributor to chromium in the very near future.

365
00:15:46,909 --> 00:15:50,739
And then also Microsoft announced a new open source project for react

366
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,650
native developers who want to target Windows react native for Windows.

367
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,239
-- Like dude,
-- I hate React native.

368
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,080
I I do too. But

369
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,719
if you want to write an app quickly and easily for multiple platforms,

370
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:06,760
react native is actually not that bad of a choice, you can actually get stuff done.

371
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:08,650
People hate

372
00:16:08,859 --> 00:16:08,880
it,

373
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,909
you know, I get that people hate it like PHP but it does allow people to get stuff done.

374
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:17,130
Well, my biggest complaint is it's just such a resource hog.

375
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:19,770
Yeah. And in five years, your computer will be faster,

376
00:16:19,969 --> 00:16:20,039
man,

377
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:23,719
whatever. That's the same. We had the same thing with Java. Remember

378
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:25,159
we still do.

379
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:25,729
Yeah.

380
00:16:25,739 --> 00:16:30,150
Well, people proposing to build Java specific chips and it's like, wait a second,

381
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:32,049
what's the whole point of Java to be like independent

382
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:34,159
of all this crap and like just run everywhere.

383
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:37,750
And now you're proposing for performance that we build a Java chip.

384
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,650
They, they, they did it with cell phones, man.

385
00:16:39,854 --> 00:16:42,984
Like the feature phones are essentially running

386
00:16:42,994 --> 00:16:45,455
like a Magic Java operating system,

387
00:16:45,465 --> 00:16:46,085
something

388
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:47,965
which whatever, I don't know

389
00:16:48,145 --> 00:16:49,364
anyway. Anyway.

390
00:16:49,554 --> 00:16:54,044
But, uh, and then finally just a total random thing that they announced yesterday,

391
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:59,424
they're doing some sort of secure verifiable voting for, you know,

392
00:16:59,505 --> 00:17:00,914
democratic elections,

393
00:17:00,924 --> 00:17:04,885
which now personally I'm not a big fan of electronic elections because

394
00:17:05,094 --> 00:17:08,885
the, the, even as a technical person, the effort to validate

395
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:11,219
but things have not been shenanigan

396
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,449
is very difficult.

397
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:18,300
And so I like my little, you know, make your X or check mark on the circle in the paper,

398
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,219
fold it and shove it in the ballot box and

399
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,089
you know, you can teach a 10 year old to,

400
00:17:22,358 --> 00:17:25,290
to scrutineer the election and make sure no shenanigans happened.

401
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,689
But at the same time, I get it because like, let's face it whether or not we like it,

402
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:31,040
electronic voting is coming and it's going

403
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:31,880
to be

404
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:36,890
a more normal thing and it's gonna be probably the default within 20 years.

405
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:39,660
I, I don't think you're wrong

406
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,380
and I guess this is one of those things, we'll just have to wait and see

407
00:17:43,589 --> 00:17:47,619
what they're talking about because from the things I read, it sounded very

408
00:17:47,729 --> 00:17:51,780
fluffy and nondescript and, and obviously, this is one of those places,

409
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:55,180
this is kind of like encryption where good enough isn't good enough.

410
00:17:55,469 --> 00:17:58,979
It sounds good. Uh They're releasing it open source this summer on github

411
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:01,869
obviously, because where else would you release open source nowadays?

412
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,140
-- Especially if you're Microsoft.
-- Well, and that's a super important thing too.

413
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:05,939
Right? Because

414
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,719
I think releasing it is open source gives obviously the world can inspect it,

415
00:18:10,729 --> 00:18:14,199
but it also gives a certain air of legitimacy that we've been lacking.

416
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:17,520
Where I know there have been instances where someone has tried suing an

417
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,520
electronic voting machine maker saying give us your source code and they're like,

418
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,680
no, no, I won't,

419
00:18:21,689 --> 00:18:24,859
-- I don't want to
-- same thing for breathalyzers and some other devices where, you know,

420
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:25,239
there's,

421
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,949
there's real world implications if these things are not

422
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:30,579
calibrated correctly or have like a little error.

423
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:31,510
And yeah,

424
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,510
mostly these companies have gotten away with not showing their

425
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,469
uh their source code or their process or anything,

426
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:38,660
-- right?
-- In effect.

427
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:43,229
I remember reading of a case with the Breathalyzer where the, the defendant

428
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,150
said,

429
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,630
I want to see the source code and make sure this is like the real deal

430
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:49,569
and they basically let the case get thrown

431
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:51,479
out instead of handing over the source code,

432
00:18:51,489 --> 00:18:51,910
which is

433
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,469
like, what, what that doesn't? That's nuts to me. What are you, why are you doing?

434
00:18:56,479 --> 00:19:00,310
Well, what that indicates to me is that it probably is a flaming train wreck.

435
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,050
So rather than they'd rather just chuck out one

436
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,390
court case than risk because the thing you remember,

437
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,869
this guy sees if this guy sees the source code and can prove that it's all wonky.

438
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,569
Then every single court case based on that result,

439
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:14,349
which would basically be like every

440
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:17,589
driving intoxication case in that state or whatever would then

441
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,099
be called into question,

442
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,859
right? And companies have a rich history of this.

443
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:20,979
Like,

444
00:19:20,989 --> 00:19:23,660
remember the Toyota unintended acceleration where they fought it and

445
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,859
they tried to blame people and people went to jail

446
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:29,520
-- when it turns out it was their car that messed up.
-- No, I hear you.

447
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:34,020
It's, this is where I love. Just default to open makes so many things so much easier.

448
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:37,510
And it's one of those, those things I think you and I have talked about this.

449
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,520
I don't remember if we've done it on the podcast ever.

450
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:44,859
But like the easiest example is saying if Amazon open sourced all of Aws tomorrow,

451
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:46,819
could anyone build Aws?

452
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,979
And the answer is no, no, they couldn't.

453
00:19:50,609 --> 00:19:53,670
Well, what just worries me is when you introduce profit motive to things like

454
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,329
running an election,

455
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,410
I find that a bit worrying

456
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:58,189
and,

457
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,189
you know, open sourcing obviously is orthogonal to that.

458
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:06,869
But these companies that refuse to open source their stuff, do

459
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:10,119
you know, to this, perceived, wanting to protect their profits and stuff

460
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,900
that does freak me out a bit.

461
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,329
And so I'm, I'm glad that, you know, like elections, Canada and you know,

462
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,569
Alberta elections run the elections and it's not,

463
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:18,329
they're,

464
00:20:18,339 --> 00:20:20,459
they're generally not buying a whole bunch

465
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,170
of wonky computer equipment from private companies

466
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,780
or Alberta elections

467
00:20:25,069 --> 00:20:27,579
are not Alberta election. Was it the municipal election?

468
00:20:27,589 --> 00:20:30,709
I forget which one I voted in, but they did have an electronic thing, but it generated

469
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:31,530
a paper.

470
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,560
-- And were you allowed to, like, look at the paper and make sure the right
-- thing?

471
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:39,469
I had to, I had to take the paper out of the machine and then shove the ballot box.

472
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:41,369
Right. And so I'm ok with that. Right. Because,

473
00:20:41,569 --> 00:20:43,770
I mean, as long as it's, you know, making, you know,

474
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:44,520
like,

475
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,650
what was that one classic one in Florida where it's like

476
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,329
you can actually press the button and it would like,

477
00:20:48,339 --> 00:20:49,290
choose the other person.

478
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,949
And it wasn't clear if that was like an error or a screen calibration issue. But

479
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,489
like using this electronic system, it was clear that man,

480
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,250
-- these screens suck and they need to be calibrated more because
-- they're,

481
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,310
they're really bad.

482
00:20:59,319 --> 00:20:59,810
I've,

483
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,390
I've never voted on a screen like that for voting,

484
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,030
but I've used enough touch screens in enough

485
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,510
situations to know that they are terrible.

486
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:09,469
And in fact, no, you know what?

487
00:21:09,479 --> 00:21:14,459
-- I just did this and I, I went to, there's a restaurant chain in the US called Red
-- Robin.

488
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,400
-- Oh, yeah, we have them here. Oh, ok.
-- Cool.

489
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:19,310
Anyway, I wanted to go because they just started the Impossible Burger,

490
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:23,630
which is a meatless hamburger that looks and tastes like a real hamburger.

491
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,900
And it was surprisingly similar.

492
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,150
I, I did find though when I took a bite of the meat, the,

493
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,660
the Impossible Burger and then I took a bite of like an actual real hamburger.

494
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:35,040
-- You could tell. So,
-- did you actually order two burgers to do a B testing?

495
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:36,800
No, I ate my kid's burger.

496
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:37,699
He,

497
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:40,989
he didn't finish it because like a freaking kid

498
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,310
he orders like the largest milkshake on the menu.

499
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:45,510
Eats the whole thing first and then is like,

500
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,680
I'm full after taking two bites of your hamburger.

501
00:21:47,732 --> 00:21:47,751
Yeah.

502
00:21:47,852 --> 00:21:50,072
My kids do the exact same thing.

503
00:21:50,082 --> 00:21:52,661
They'll, they'll do their milkshake and they eat some French fries.

504
00:21:52,862 --> 00:21:53,271
That's right.

505
00:21:53,281 --> 00:21:54,651
And the only reason I didn't do it is because

506
00:21:54,661 --> 00:21:56,881
they didn't have giant milkshakes at most of the restaurants when

507
00:21:56,991 --> 00:21:57,751
I was a kid.

508
00:21:57,921 --> 00:22:01,972
No. But anyway, anyway, and they have like, these little touchscreen table

509
00:22:02,082 --> 00:22:05,151
things on the tables and you can pay at them. And I thought this amuses me.

510
00:22:05,161 --> 00:22:06,232
I'm going to pay at this

511
00:22:06,452 --> 00:22:07,751
and it took me

512
00:22:08,151 --> 00:22:11,511
probably 10 minutes of screwing around to finally, like, the

513
00:22:11,614 --> 00:22:14,394
touch screen wouldn't register clicks or I'd hit it

514
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:17,553
and then I'd, like, hit it again and the screen had just flipped at that point and I,

515
00:22:17,563 --> 00:22:18,573
like, clicked the wrong thing.

516
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:22,423
-- And I'm like, oh, my goodness, this is a nightmare.
-- This really drives home to me why?

517
00:22:22,433 --> 00:22:25,604
Apple tablets cost more money because the quality of the screen,

518
00:22:25,614 --> 00:22:27,114
the touchscreen they use is fantastic.

519
00:22:27,124 --> 00:22:28,913
Like, I've never had a calibration issue.

520
00:22:29,004 --> 00:22:31,193
I've never had to calibrate my kids' ipads.

521
00:22:31,494 --> 00:22:33,154
Well, and for what it's worth though, I've,

522
00:22:33,163 --> 00:22:36,296
I've bought some cheap tablets and I've never had, I had an issue with them.

523
00:22:36,306 --> 00:22:39,916
I think the problem becomes when they're in any sort of commercial environment,

524
00:22:39,965 --> 00:22:41,576
they get dropped, they get kicked.

525
00:22:41,586 --> 00:22:44,316
You've got kids, like banging on it with the forks. And, you know,

526
00:22:44,475 --> 00:22:47,245
that's the real problem is just kind of the longevity and I'm

527
00:22:47,255 --> 00:22:50,196
sure an ipod in that environment would not fare much better.

528
00:22:50,306 --> 00:22:52,916
Well, this is why mill spec gear costs so much because yeah,

529
00:22:52,926 --> 00:22:54,475
you can drop and it still works.

530
00:22:55,365 --> 00:22:57,426
You can run it over with a tank. It's fine.

531
00:22:57,845 --> 00:22:59,245
Like I literally just had

532
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:02,359
my computer stopped talking to my keyboard.

533
00:23:02,369 --> 00:23:04,410
I turned my keyboard off, it disconnected.

534
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,599
I turned it on it connected but,

535
00:23:05,609 --> 00:23:09,359
and I button mashed and something happened but like not keypresses.

536
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:12,689
So I restarted the computer. Still same problem.

537
00:23:12,699 --> 00:23:15,790
I turned the computer all the way off and all the way on in magic. It works again.

538
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,119
It's like voodoo, right?

539
00:23:20,219 --> 00:23:21,579
I'm a computer guy.

540
00:23:21,589 --> 00:23:24,760
I'm not even going to pretend to be able to fix these things anymore.

541
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:30,089
So, but back to Microsoft. So it's, it's pretty clear, Microsoft gets open source.

542
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:32,359
It's like, OK, they've embraced open source that hold

543
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:32,609
on,

544
00:23:33,069 --> 00:23:33,119
hold

545
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:33,479
on

546
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:35,000
before we go on.

547
00:23:35,069 --> 00:23:38,050
You miss the most important news story about Microsoft that

548
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,520
I think is from the day before we're recording.

549
00:23:41,459 --> 00:23:45,319
Solitaire was inducted into the video game Hall of Fame.

550
00:23:45,589 --> 00:23:50,589
So, uh I can do you one better. My mom still has her Sony Vio super slim laptop from

551
00:23:50,689 --> 00:23:52,359
mid two thousands

552
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,020
that she uses to play Solitaire on Windows XP.

553
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,699
Because all the other versions of solitaire on the

554
00:23:57,709 --> 00:24:00,160
App store and stuff just aren't good enough.

555
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:03,119
-- Yeah,
-- they're bad. They're bad. The old solitaire is like my favorite.

556
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:05,670
In fact, you could, you could, you know, you could buy her a new computer.

557
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,229
You can go, I think it's, I

558
00:24:07,449 --> 00:24:08,869
think archive.org or some,

559
00:24:09,334 --> 00:24:14,084
you can like, run Windows 31 and play the Solitaire. Like the Solitaire.

560
00:24:14,094 --> 00:24:17,925
-- Not these terrible remakes. No,
-- this is, she likes the Windows XP version.

561
00:24:17,935 --> 00:24:21,574
And so this machine has no internet connectivity and that's awesome.

562
00:24:21,584 --> 00:24:24,974
That's all it does. It just runs Solitaire once in a while for her and, and, you know?

563
00:24:25,555 --> 00:24:25,984
Yeah,

564
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:28,729
that is fantastic.

565
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,849
I love that.

566
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,849
But, but anyway, back to your point.

567
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:35,609
Yes, Microsoft gets open source now, which, like,

568
00:24:35,619 --> 00:24:37,890
I don't know what to think about that.

569
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:38,500
Yeah. Oh,

570
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,959
the world has changed very fundamentally

571
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,369
that, that's one thing that's clear, like open source one. It's, it's just

572
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,760
like all these companies that build apps and they're like, oh,

573
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,869
we don't do open source and it's like, well, but you're writing this in.

574
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,760
No Js. So, yeah. Yeah, you're, you're sucking down like 1000 dependencies, right?

575
00:24:53,949 --> 00:24:56,489
Like all these, like, what is it, these software companies that do,

576
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,640
like the automated audits of, like, what's in your software and they're like,

577
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:03,680
here's a list. It's really long, you know, it reminded me when I went to, um

578
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:05,479
uh what was it, Mercedes, right.

579
00:25:05,489 --> 00:25:05,760
They,

580
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,989
they have these web pages where you can get a list

581
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,670
of all the open source software in that model of car.

582
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,880
Remember we did a show on this

583
00:25:12,099 --> 00:25:15,540
and there was like the one model of car had like 1200 entries,

584
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,619
like 1200 projects,

585
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:22,750
you know, from image parsing libraries and audio parsing libraries to,

586
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,790
to whatever.

587
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:27,869
Well, now here's, here's something else that's really important I think is so

588
00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:30,199
the computers in cars

589
00:25:30,469 --> 00:25:32,739
have always contained a bunch of crap.

590
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:35,250
The car manufacturers did not write, you know, the,

591
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:39,150
the whole dependency universe we see today, this is not new, it's just,

592
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,650
it was very hidden before.

593
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,180
And I think this is also one of the big advantages you get

594
00:25:43,189 --> 00:25:46,869
with open source is there are a handful of licenses that basically say,

595
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:47,560
you know,

596
00:25:47,569 --> 00:25:49,719
you have to publish this license with the source

597
00:25:49,729 --> 00:25:51,640
code if you're going to use our stuff.

598
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:55,920
And I think one of the really cool defaults is that a lot of companies were just like,

599
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:56,359
screw it.

600
00:25:56,369 --> 00:25:57,729
We're just going to publish everything.

601
00:25:57,739 --> 00:26:00,640
We're not going to figure out which ones we do or don't have to do this with.

602
00:26:00,869 --> 00:26:04,079
And that's really cool and I don't think they did that out of

603
00:26:04,219 --> 00:26:05,229
altruistic intent.

604
00:26:05,239 --> 00:26:09,280
I think it was just more of a, this is easier than digging through it.

605
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:12,479
Well, having one process versus multiple processes. Right.

606
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:15,060
And plus you're more likely to not mess it up and get sued,

607
00:26:15,069 --> 00:26:16,180
-- but you're
-- going to mess it up.

608
00:26:16,189 --> 00:26:18,209
Guarantee. I guarantee they mess it up.

609
00:26:18,219 --> 00:26:21,030
Now, I guarantee there are things in those cars

610
00:26:21,349 --> 00:26:25,130
that they don't realize are there and should we have licenses published?

611
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,790
They just haven't figured it out and maybe they will someday, maybe they won't. But

612
00:26:28,939 --> 00:26:29,890
I guarantee it.

613
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,329
-- No,
-- it's a, it's a brave new world. And

614
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,050
honestly, I'm kind of looking at this.

615
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:38,609
It's, it's pretty clear, like I, I literally, the only reason I use Macs is because

616
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:42,060
I have an iphone and so the whole ecosystem just sort of plays

617
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,939
well with itself and I don't have to do any setup or

618
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:48,089
really much in the way of maintenance or configuration.

619
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:50,329
Whereas, you know, if I had an Android phone in the Windows

620
00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:51,670
PC,

621
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,109
you know,

622
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:55,260
I'd have to spend a little time and effort getting them to play well with each other.

623
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:59,209
-- Right.
-- I just don't let my phone talk to anything else because why,

624
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:02,449
-- like I, I don't have a purpose to it. Honestly,
-- I use omni

625
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:06,579
-- focus to, to basically run and organize my life, right?
-- And that's fair.

626
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:09,329
Having that synchronized with all my devices is pretty critical

627
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:11,760
or I'm going to end up naked outside and starve.

628
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:12,010
Yeah.

629
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:16,609
There you go. I actually started using Google Keep for some, some reasons

630
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:19,000
and one of the cool things is obviously I can access

631
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:22,030
it from everything because it's just a web browser plug in

632
00:27:22,199 --> 00:27:23,050
something or other.

633
00:27:23,339 --> 00:27:25,630
And I like it too because I can share lists.

634
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,849
So, like, if I ever go pick this up at the grocery store, I can share it with my wife and

635
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,420
she can add all the stuff I'm supposed to get

636
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,650
and otherwise would forget and just come home with,

637
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,540
you know, 70 bags of potato chips.

638
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:42,290
Don't laugh. I do that and I've mostly been banned from going to the store. So

639
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,010
I, I sometimes I'm,

640
00:27:44,449 --> 00:27:45,709
I love to go to Costco.

641
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:47,810
-- I,
-- I'm allowed to actually,

642
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:50,089
I'm better than she is at Costco because I try to

643
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:53,890
-- keep my bill under $200 and she does not
-- see,

644
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,729
I find the trick is,

645
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:58,170
is to eat right before you go to Costco so that you actually want to get out of there.

646
00:27:58,589 --> 00:28:00,449
Uh That's fair. That's fair.

647
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:01,079
But

648
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,270
yeah, anyway, I still, I still come home with, although when I go to Costco,

649
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,119
I just come home with three bags of chips that

650
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:08,770
are the equivalent of 75 regular bags of chips.

651
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,170
So there is that.

652
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:11,810
But anyway, anyway,

653
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,819
uh Right. So yeah, I,

654
00:28:15,849 --> 00:28:17,930
I don't even know what to say, man. I feel like

655
00:28:18,109 --> 00:28:21,020
this is a new exciting territory and

656
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,000
I look forward to where it goes.

657
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:26,800
This is going to bring open source to the masses like all

658
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:31,689
the people stuck in open plan cubicles will be open source users.

659
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:35,439
Uh, and, and they'll know it, I guess, is the key because they already are

660
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:39,339
and they'll be happy about it too because it'll be, it's, it's officially blessed.

661
00:28:39,349 --> 00:28:39,729
It,

662
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:42,459
like my experience of Microsoft is they generally don't

663
00:28:42,469 --> 00:28:44,910
release stuff until it actually works reasonably well.

664
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,430
You know.

665
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:48,150
And, uh, it,

666
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,550
it's just gonna mostly work. It's gonna,

667
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:54,349
it's basically, they're gonna remove a lot of pain points,

668
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,859
make things easier, make these people more productive.

669
00:28:57,479 --> 00:29:00,119
Um, they're not going to have to relearn a whole bunch of stuff. You know.

670
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,729
That's one thing I always got with open source is

671
00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:03,020
that if you wanted to make the switch from,

672
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:06,400
like to open source from windows, like, ok, cool, forget everything,

673
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:08,089
you know about windows and now go learn Linux

674
00:29:08,739 --> 00:29:09,410
right

675
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,760
straight up, you know, and nobody wants to do that,

676
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:18,849
-- you know, that's
-- a pain unless you're 13 and you have infinite time.

677
00:29:19,449 --> 00:29:19,739
But

678
00:29:20,199 --> 00:29:23,510
even then 13 year olds don't have time anymore. They're all busy playing Fortnite.

679
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,979
-- So, uh,
-- I heard Fortnite was out and Apex Legends is in,

680
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:30,130
that's what I was. I was actually told by another parent. Apparently.

681
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:33,859
-- Apparently I missed the whole fortnight train.
-- My, my kids have played them both

682
00:29:33,989 --> 00:29:36,930
and they've been falling back to Fortnite lately because they just

683
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:37,069
a

684
00:29:37,189 --> 00:29:40,089
bunch of, uh, marvel content into Fortnite,

685
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:40,569
the

686
00:29:40,739 --> 00:29:41,030
Avengers

687
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:41,209
movie.

688
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:44,699
-- Right. So that's hip again.
-- So they're taking the legal approach,

689
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,020
right? And good for them, I'm all whatever. I'm all for it.

690
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,589
But it's, uh, yeah, it's like, you know,

691
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:52,079
kids are fickle and they're going to do whatever.

692
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,780
So, yeah, we'll see.

693
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,040
I have, I have no doubt in three months it'll be something else

694
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,469
and that's fine. That's fine. It's, uh,

695
00:29:59,599 --> 00:29:59,910
right.

696
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,670
Anyway, although I will say one of the cool things with Fortnite is I'll,

697
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,060
I'll play it with my kids and of course I lose real bad.

698
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:05,449
But, well,

699
00:30:05,459 --> 00:30:09,359
you can turn on like sandbox mode where you just like hang out and build things and,

700
00:30:09,369 --> 00:30:10,359
and mess around

701
00:30:10,489 --> 00:30:11,939
the building mechanics. Look fun.

702
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,050
It's, it's all right,

703
00:30:13,285 --> 00:30:15,045
but it's really buggy. So it's really fun.

704
00:30:15,055 --> 00:30:18,275
Like we'll figure out ways to clip into things and get under the floor and all that

705
00:30:18,405 --> 00:30:21,775
and that, like that kind of stuff I love and the kids think it's awesome, like,

706
00:30:21,785 --> 00:30:23,734
-- oh look what's going on, you know,
-- and I,

707
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:27,214
I actively Felix is now at the point where he'll,

708
00:30:27,224 --> 00:30:30,635
he'll come running into the room holding his ipad saying I glitched it,

709
00:30:30,645 --> 00:30:31,604
I glitched it.

710
00:30:32,395 --> 00:30:35,515
And also, and this is going to make you laugh. He's playing ticket to ride.

711
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:38,170
And he was basically trying to work out the traveling

712
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,869
salesman problem so that he could unlock these achievements,

713
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,949
like, you know, connecting all the Russian cities.

714
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:47,219
And he actually had like a piece of paper and he's like, you know, II I was like,

715
00:30:47,229 --> 00:30:51,209
no step back or don't start talking about graph theory, shut up and do it his way.

716
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,540
Right. But uh

717
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,150
he like, literally was, you know,

718
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,359
he was basically starting to discover the primitives of graph theory, you know,

719
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:59,680
and the traveling salesman problem and why

720
00:30:59,689 --> 00:31:01,959
this is actually a pretty complicated problem.

721
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:02,260
Oh,

722
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:03,839
that's hilarious.

723
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,699
You know, and I asked him the one simple question, like,

724
00:31:05,709 --> 00:31:07,930
do you actually have enough trains to physically connect all the cities?

725
00:31:07,939 --> 00:31:08,359
And he went,

726
00:31:08,469 --> 00:31:09,000
oh,

727
00:31:09,349 --> 00:31:11,089
you know, and you could see the wheels turning in his head.

728
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:13,969
So I love that these games can really

729
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:16,439
have an impact on kids and really encourage them.

730
00:31:16,449 --> 00:31:17,939
And that's the other thing I love, you know,

731
00:31:17,949 --> 00:31:20,290
is all these kids that have windows on their desktop,

732
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,770
assuming they don't have a chromebook.

733
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:25,260
Now all of a sudden they have access to, how do I put it nicely?

734
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,859
An actual proper tool chain

735
00:31:26,959 --> 00:31:29,670
that doesn't cost a lot of money because that was the thing that always got me right

736
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,569
is especially in the Windows world is if you wanted a proper development tool chain,

737
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,160
not cheap.

738
00:31:35,489 --> 00:31:36,900
And, and I'm not gonna lie to you.

739
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:39,400
That's what got me into Linux back in the day was they,

740
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:43,839
I got a free C compiler and that was back when even I could afford the tools, right?

741
00:31:43,849 --> 00:31:44,969
Even as a student,

742
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,790
uh visual visual studio, student price when I was in,

743
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,130
in high school and college was 100 bucks.

744
00:31:50,489 --> 00:31:51,219
And

745
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:54,180
I didn't have $100 at the time.

746
00:31:54,189 --> 00:31:58,219
So I'm like, I'm just going to run this Linux thing and yeah, it no regrets.

747
00:31:58,229 --> 00:31:59,780
But anyway, all right, man,

748
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:00,780
I think it's time

749
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:04,219
I'm gonna call it. So I guess thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.
