Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:11,050
Kurt Siefried and my partner in thought experiments.

2
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,069
Josh Pressers.

3
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:15,619
Yeah, we're gonna thought experiment this one up today because we don't,

4
00:00:15,819 --> 00:00:18,049
well, there's not if it's real yet. So

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,700
we don't have any option. There's no facts.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:22,659
I mean,

7
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:27,020
so we're just gonna, we're gonna theory craft. There's a fact. OK.

8
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:28,290
So I want to,

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,860
there's a proposed fact is that a fact?

10
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:32,520
There is

11
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:33,259
a

12
00:00:33,389 --> 00:00:33,840
proposed,

13
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:34,159
it's like

14
00:00:34,319 --> 00:00:34,330
a

15
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,500
theory right now, but whether or not we have the evidence to support it existing,

16
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,279
we'll find out

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,259
we're gonna find out. OK.

18
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:46,630
So there's two things that I think have come together nicely. We had a listener

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,689
and, and I forget it was email or a master a message or something but said,

20
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,979
hey, you should talk about Graphene Os,

21
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,360
which is a,

22
00:00:54,700 --> 00:01:00,020
like it's an operating, it's an Android Os you'd install on a pixel phone, right?

23
00:01:00,029 --> 00:01:01,970
Which is not like the official Android.

24
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,380
It's one of those like,

25
00:01:03,389 --> 00:01:05,269
like jazzed up versions and it's got a bunch

26
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:06,819
of cool security features and stuff in it.

27
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:11,660
But the, the I think this ties into the other half, which is the FCC

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,250
has approved a cybersecurity label for commu consumer devices.

29
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,860
This is think of it like an underwriters label type.

30
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,190
It's meant to be

31
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,139
a way to convey to consumers that this device

32
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,510
has gone through some sort of security approval process.

33
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:27,940
Right.

34
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:32,610
Well, ok, first of all, is it going to be external validation or,

35
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,650
or self certification?

36
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:33,870
Like

37
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:34,330
we

38
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,209
don't know yet?

39
00:01:35,449 --> 00:01:37,129
No, there's literally no details.

40
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:40,410
So we're going, this is where the thought experiment comes in. We're gonna pretend

41
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,790
it works perfectly for the context of this conversation. We know it won't.

42
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,449
And we know these things take years and years and years to develop. But

43
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,050
I, I'm interested in discussing this

44
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:53,529
from a, a very experimental place, we'll say.

45
00:01:53,809 --> 00:01:56,410
So I want to start with rooting Android phones first because I

46
00:01:56,419 --> 00:01:58,989
want to lay some of the groundwork around all of this.

47
00:01:59,250 --> 00:01:59,860
So,

48
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:02,099
so we're not even gonna pretend about Apple

49
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,510
phones being rooted and modified just Android only.

50
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,860
You can't, you can't look,

51
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,449
I'm not gonna pretend you can root an Apple

52
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:09,889
phone because that's like to jailbreak an Apple phone.

53
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:14,500
You are doing horrible things to the device or you can just give that

54
00:02:14,742 --> 00:02:16,292
photo Apple for a million bucks.

55
00:02:16,593 --> 00:02:16,992
I mean,

56
00:02:18,363 --> 00:02:19,182
not Apple for

57
00:02:19,552 --> 00:02:19,662
more.

58
00:02:20,072 --> 00:02:23,263
I think the Android example is good because this is something people.

59
00:02:23,272 --> 00:02:26,873
So OK, you've got a pixel phone, right? It runs Google's operating system.

60
00:02:26,882 --> 00:02:28,873
Like in my case, I had a pixel too.

61
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,932
So pause for a second because this is something I'm not 100% clear on Google.

62
00:02:31,942 --> 00:02:35,052
My understanding is there's Android Os for phones and there is like

63
00:02:35,253 --> 00:02:35,283
real

64
00:02:35,636 --> 00:02:36,516
Google one

65
00:02:36,835 --> 00:02:38,945
that gives you access to the Google store

66
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,576
and then there's like the third party ones and

67
00:02:41,585 --> 00:02:43,645
you can't have access to the Google Store,

68
00:02:43,656 --> 00:02:47,555
but you have to, you can have access to like your carrier, I guess phone store.

69
00:02:48,055 --> 00:02:48,815
We'll get to that.

70
00:02:50,576 --> 00:02:50,845
I'm not

71
00:02:51,076 --> 00:02:51,085
a

72
00:02:51,186 --> 00:02:53,886
person. So I legitimately don't know because I'm an Apple person.

73
00:02:53,895 --> 00:02:55,966
It's like my choices are apple. Pay apple

74
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:00,800
or hold it correctly and pay Apple. Yeah. Pay, pay Apple. You have no choice.

75
00:03:00,809 --> 00:03:01,800
There's no plan B

76
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,399
and OK, so I'm, I'm gonna put this in the context of my

77
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,710
life experiences in this space, right?

78
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,160
I bought a pi the,

79
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:13,089
the pixel two phone is what made me buy an iphone because I was so angry.

80
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:15,630
I bought a pixel two Google end of life

81
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,000
in three years.

82
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:18,429
Yeah. What do you think

83
00:03:19,179 --> 00:03:22,020
killed by google.com? Sorry. But I

84
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,179
know

85
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:22,830
well,

86
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:25,539
but they're claiming now they're going to support their phones for

87
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,610
like seven years or 10 years or something like that.

88
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,789
They've said that about a lot of things that they can, I

89
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,490
know that's the thing like I,

90
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,919
I don't particularly like I OS but it's because it says I OS is very like

91
00:03:37,929 --> 00:03:41,000
you do it our way or you go f yourself like those are your options.

92
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:41,639
There's,

93
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,300
it's kind of the apple way. It is the Apple way.

94
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,600
Oh, you want a laptop with a touchscreen? Yeah, we don't do that.

95
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,720
Right. Like it's,

96
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,710
it makes me so angry. But anyway, ok. Ok.

97
00:03:52,929 --> 00:03:53,559
So

98
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:58,699
now that my, my pixel phone is dead, I installed a third

99
00:03:58,813 --> 00:03:58,973
party

100
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,792
android. Well, it's not dead. It's just not supported.

101
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:03,783
Well, it's not supported by Google. Exactly.

102
00:04:04,003 --> 00:04:07,712
And so I installed at the time because I don't think Graphene existed,

103
00:04:07,753 --> 00:04:10,272
but I installed Lineage Os on it way back in the day.

104
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:14,192
Right. And to do that though, you have to unlock your boot loader

105
00:04:14,412 --> 00:04:18,322
which like wipes the phone and it makes it very easy to hack essentially,

106
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,382
which is what I'm doing.

107
00:04:19,442 --> 00:04:21,213
You're basically a disabling secure boot.

108
00:04:21,463 --> 00:04:22,113
Yeah. Yeah, for sure.

109
00:04:22,842 --> 00:04:23,592
And then

110
00:04:23,923 --> 00:04:24,993
from that point forward,

111
00:04:25,316 --> 00:04:29,515
I had basically an insecure phone from the like local attack perspective

112
00:04:29,626 --> 00:04:31,226
where there was like no boot protection.

113
00:04:31,235 --> 00:04:32,985
Now, when you install like lineage Os,

114
00:04:32,996 --> 00:04:37,105
you then have to go and find the Google apps if you want to use a Google environment

115
00:04:37,115 --> 00:04:39,256
and install like the play store and Gmail and

116
00:04:39,265 --> 00:04:41,545
all that crap because it's not like supported.

117
00:04:41,686 --> 00:04:45,626
I bought a cheap unlocked Android phone because I was trying to get an old game.

118
00:04:45,635 --> 00:04:48,105
My son likes to work and it was, I found the A PK

119
00:04:48,515 --> 00:04:51,145
and I went through a whole song and dance to get

120
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:53,540
a pks to work on this phone and then of course,

121
00:04:53,549 --> 00:04:55,429
I did an operating system update and it all broke.

122
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,079
So I honestly I gave up,

123
00:04:57,369 --> 00:04:59,920
it was just so unreliable. It, that's fair.

124
00:04:59,929 --> 00:05:03,880
And the cheap Android devices definitely suffer from this where it's just like

125
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,559
madness all the time because you don't know what you're going to get.

126
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:07,790
But the pixel phones don't.

127
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:10,630
So anyway, fast forward many years

128
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:14,720
and now there's a thing called graphene Os and graph you Os took Android,

129
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,937
they reduced a bunch of attack surface.

130
00:05:16,946 --> 00:05:19,337
They like turned off a bunch of like NFC.

131
00:05:19,346 --> 00:05:22,497
You can turn off, you can switch from like five G to LTE.

132
00:05:22,506 --> 00:05:25,027
In theory, the five G code isn't as tested or something.

133
00:05:25,036 --> 00:05:26,076
I don't totally understand it,

134
00:05:26,087 --> 00:05:29,416
but it's got like loads of security crap built into it.

135
00:05:29,427 --> 00:05:32,657
And the best part though is you have to unlock your boot loader,

136
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,437
you install graph E OS and then you can lock it back up again.

137
00:05:35,446 --> 00:05:37,837
So you, you get like that benefit, which is very, very cool.

138
00:05:37,846 --> 00:05:39,976
And I was really excited when I saw that, but

139
00:05:40,194 --> 00:05:41,753
you still suffer from the,

140
00:05:41,764 --> 00:05:43,514
you have to go and find like the Google A

141
00:05:43,523 --> 00:05:46,433
pks and install them in the weird side load manner.

142
00:05:46,444 --> 00:05:49,743
And there's still things that don't work correctly. Like for example,

143
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:55,873
there are applications that will only run on like the official Google Android

144
00:05:56,003 --> 00:05:59,653
thing, right? Like banking apps are notorious for this.

145
00:05:59,664 --> 00:06:04,234
There's I think Netflix is on the list and in fairness though, those apps are also,

146
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:04,971
they like,

147
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,501
I guess the idea would be they don't want to run on a compromised phone because like,

148
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,381
oh, an attacker

149
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,580
took over this phone. So, like, I, I think that's the idea, right?

150
00:06:13,591 --> 00:06:15,670
Is you don't, they don't know the state of the phone.

151
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,091
So, and, and I, I suspect in the case of like video application,

152
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:20,851
something like Netflix or, or whatever,

153
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:24,420
they don't want people to capture the video, copyright protection. Right.

154
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,121
That's, that's probably what that is

155
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:27,080
open

156
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,371
source. HDM I Cable.

157
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,209
No, seriously. Right. That was the whole thing on L TT.

158
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:33,429
We'll never have an open source HDM I Cable.

159
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,609
And I'm like, well, of course we want like, because copyright protection.

160
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,820
Yeah, that's, that's what they want it for, for sure. It's nuts

161
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,010
anyway. Ok.

162
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,779
So

163
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,480
we kind of set the stage here where you've got a device, it,

164
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,570
it maybe becomes unsupported.

165
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,380
You do another thing with it

166
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,619
and

167
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:54,679
now you have this, I guess hostile environment.

168
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,720
We'll call it in the traditional absence where things like

169
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,670
the Google Play Store is gonna say, can we trust this, this device?

170
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:04,059
We don't know, we don't know what this is, we don't know what's going on.

171
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:04,540
Yeah,

172
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,899
there's, I mean, this happens even with like games and stuff.

173
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:12,570
Like one of my favorite examples is uh Genshin Impact which is uh a Chinese made game.

174
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:13,269
It's by Miho

175
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,570
Yu, I think is the name of the company behind it.

176
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:17,579
But my kids were playing it for a while and they were like, hey,

177
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:18,649
you should play this with us

178
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:23,049
and I went to install it on my computer and it installed, like, I'm like, no way,

179
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:24,350
I'm not putting this on a computer.

180
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:27,850
This thing is like installing, basically root kits is copyright,

181
00:07:28,454 --> 00:07:29,334
cheap protection.

182
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:32,135
And again, that's the thing that has to, that,

183
00:07:32,184 --> 00:07:33,825
how else is cheap protection gonna work?

184
00:07:33,834 --> 00:07:36,825
Now, that's a whole another conversation we're not having today.

185
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:37,815
But anyway, so I'm like, oh,

186
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:39,855
it runs on Android and I have a little

187
00:07:39,864 --> 00:07:42,614
handheld android like game emulator called the Retro.

188
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,945
I'm like, I'll put it on retro,

189
00:07:44,165 --> 00:07:47,904
I install it on Retro. And the game's like this is an unlocked device.

190
00:07:47,915 --> 00:07:49,815
We will not run here. I'm like, whatever.

191
00:07:49,825 --> 00:07:52,494
I was like, kids are not playing this game with you. I give up. But

192
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,250
anyway, anyway, ok, we put all that together, right?

193
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,089
So

194
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,149
the question

195
00:07:58,329 --> 00:07:59,290
becomes,

196
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,149
let's say you have a device, let's say it's potentially secured

197
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,209
and now I'm a user and I mess with it.

198
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,160
And now the default for a lot of organizations is to say,

199
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,320
like we just don't trust this device, we're not going to play with it.

200
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:11,750
Ok.

201
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,109
Well, yeah, I mean, we see this all the time in real life where for example, this guy,

202
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,510
I think it was in Newfoundland wanted to build his own house,

203
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:20,540
which you can do if you get plans and permits and inspections.

204
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:25,095
But he wanted to use some historical lumber. And what's interesting is

205
00:08:25,265 --> 00:08:29,345
the inspector said I can't certify this because it doesn't have the stamp,

206
00:08:29,674 --> 00:08:33,294
even though you and I both know that this 12 inch beam is like

207
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:36,924
stronger than anything. Home Depot could even dream of selling you,

208
00:08:37,065 --> 00:08:40,304
but because it's not stamped and it's not like, like an aircraft part,

209
00:08:40,315 --> 00:08:44,183
it doesn't have that paperwork, can't certify, it, can't inspect it and approve it.

210
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,530
And I feel like this is like a lot of things like a lot of people are like,

211
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:48,340
oh no,

212
00:08:48,349 --> 00:08:52,599
I did the wiring myself and it's better than code or I did this and it's better and,

213
00:08:52,609 --> 00:08:55,090
but you actually inspect it and once in a while it's like,

214
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,510
oh, you made a whoopsie, you didn't bond the ground properly or

215
00:08:59,989 --> 00:09:02,650
you might think you did something to make it better.

216
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,700
Well, maybe you did, maybe you didn't,

217
00:09:04,869 --> 00:09:07,570
maybe, maybe. And that's the question right now.

218
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,010
I want to tie this into another

219
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,349
story which says FCC approved cybersecurity label for

220
00:09:13,776 --> 00:09:14,495
devices.

221
00:09:14,736 --> 00:09:16,926
And there's literally no information on this.

222
00:09:16,935 --> 00:09:21,125
There is a logo which I will link to a Cybertrust mark little shield thing.

223
00:09:21,265 --> 00:09:22,906
I don't think it's a very good logo because I

224
00:09:23,695 --> 00:09:27,005
it's, it's very nondescript. It's like a shield with

225
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,866
little boxes in it.

226
00:09:28,895 --> 00:09:30,366
I realized what it looks like to me,

227
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,286
it looks like when those people are doing

228
00:09:32,296 --> 00:09:35,096
the component level board repair and they accidentally

229
00:09:35,276 --> 00:09:40,156
get some of the solder connecting to things improperly. They bridge two points.

230
00:09:40,216 --> 00:09:40,325
Yeah, it

231
00:09:40,565 --> 00:09:42,056
does look like solder bridges. It looks

232
00:09:42,176 --> 00:09:42,315
like. So

233
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:43,841
a mistake on a soldering thing.

234
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:44,762
Yeah. Yeah.

235
00:09:44,872 --> 00:09:45,781
But, but so

236
00:09:45,921 --> 00:09:47,081
so not a good look. In other words,

237
00:09:47,182 --> 00:09:52,122
well, it does say us cyber trust mark on the bottom. I assume the text is not optional.

238
00:09:52,142 --> 00:09:53,601
But anyway. Ok,

239
00:09:53,932 --> 00:09:57,122
so here's, here's how I want to tie all this together. So

240
00:09:57,492 --> 00:09:58,642
let's pretend

241
00:09:58,882 --> 00:10:01,372
there is a perfect universe

242
00:10:01,552 --> 00:10:06,262
where the cyber trust mark is independently verified

243
00:10:06,521 --> 00:10:08,202
and enforced in some way.

244
00:10:08,211 --> 00:10:11,552
So, so something I did learn doing research for this particular show.

245
00:10:11,909 --> 00:10:13,830
So you know, that the UL Mark,

246
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,030
which I know UL doesn't quite mean what it

247
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,549
used to mean because there's all this like self

248
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,929
certification and stuff now. But, but what I did learn

249
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,869
is there are jurisdictions. Well, UL I should say is underwriter laboratories.

250
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,409
The idea being if you make like,

251
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:30,950
uh certain kinds of devices like plumbing and electrical and, and a power brick,

252
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,109
let's just go with power bricks.

253
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:32,469
Sure.

254
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:35,210
We'll say power, you send it off to underwriters labs,

255
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:37,929
they do whatever testing they do on these things and then

256
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,929
they put a stamp on it and you can say,

257
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,900
you know, underwriter's lab,

258
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:43,492
I tested my product and verified it's not gonna like, you know,

259
00:10:43,502 --> 00:10:45,013
burn your house down or whatever.

260
00:10:45,023 --> 00:10:48,312
Well, it's just not gonna catch fire randomly like all those E bikes do. Right.

261
00:10:48,572 --> 00:10:49,213
In theory.

262
00:10:49,422 --> 00:10:51,203
Now, what I did learn

263
00:10:51,403 --> 00:10:53,942
is that there are jurisdictions in the US

264
00:10:54,122 --> 00:10:56,122
where you cannot, it's funny

265
00:10:56,312 --> 00:10:57,543
you cannot plug in.

266
00:10:57,552 --> 00:10:58,953
It says it is apparently where it's written,

267
00:10:58,963 --> 00:11:03,172
you can't plug in devices to the wall sockets that aren't UL approved

268
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:07,843
or not approved, whatever the UL MARK is. That's a classic BS insurance thing.

269
00:11:07,853 --> 00:11:10,132
It's like use this product safely. And if you don't use this

270
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,736
briefly, hey, we're, we're off the hook.

271
00:11:11,745 --> 00:11:13,806
Don't click on suspicious links, everyone.

272
00:11:14,185 --> 00:11:15,736
But, but anyway, so here's, but,

273
00:11:15,745 --> 00:11:19,616
but I also learned that there are retailers that will

274
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:22,796
not sell electronic devices that don't have the UL Mark.

275
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:25,536
I'm betting that's a very small number of retailers.

276
00:11:25,546 --> 00:11:28,635
Now, it was probably much bigger at one point in the past.

277
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:32,846
But given the we'll say influx of surprisingly inexpensive devices,

278
00:11:32,856 --> 00:11:35,255
I see at many retailers, I'm fairly certain

279
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,736
that they're not checking the UL Mark.

280
00:11:37,885 --> 00:11:39,315
Well, and here's a problem.

281
00:11:40,309 --> 00:11:43,650
How do you verify that the Ul Mark is like legit?

282
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:48,369
I mean, I would expect some other entity to do that for me. Right.

283
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,650
Well, so there is actually a verify.ul.com

284
00:11:51,859 --> 00:11:56,770
and learn about claims, but there is like as far as I know, there's no way to plug in,

285
00:11:56,859 --> 00:11:59,700
you can actually look up devices like so for example,

286
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:03,479
here just clicking on one at random uh Flow tech co limited

287
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,210
if I typed in apple and it said no results for apple.

288
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,330
Uh

289
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,460
That's funny.

290
00:12:07,469 --> 00:12:08,630
But the point is in theory,

291
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,609
you can like look up a device model and name and validate that it.

292
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,260
Like they didn't just add this mark,

293
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,059
you know what no one's going to do and that's part of what I want to discuss, right?

294
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,940
So let's say we have this, this us cyber mark.

295
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:23,739
You have the question of kind of people understanding and enforcing because

296
00:12:23,989 --> 00:12:28,330
I, I know how the UL works. I literally have an election

297
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:31,359
engineering degree. I went to school for,

298
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:35,229
I have never once checked a product to make sure it

299
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:37,429
has a UL Mark on it when I purchased it.

300
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:40,450
And more to the point if you actually do this, there's,

301
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,030
there's not a lot of things you can validate. Like there's just not a lot of data here.

302
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:46,179
Let's pretend that the, the federal

303
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,429
Cyber mark means perfect security

304
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:50,510
for the purpose of our thought experiment.

305
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:51,349
Now,

306
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,549
here's the thing though.

307
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,619
So we know people aren't going to look for it, right.

308
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,830
You could, you could blast it on the front of your product.

309
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,469
And if I'm standing in the store

310
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,969
and there's one light bulb with the Federal Cyber mark on the front of it,

311
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,179
that's $10 more expensive than the light bulb without

312
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:07,309
it.

313
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:10,770
I think there's a 90% chance I'm going to buy the cheaper

314
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,429
one because I'm a cheap skate and that's just how I roll.

315
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,900
Well, and there's no knowledge of what that mark means, even if I know what it means,

316
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:18,690
I think.

317
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,500
But for a

318
00:13:19,775 --> 00:13:20,284
person,

319
00:13:20,414 --> 00:13:23,304
yes, a normal person is going to be like, I have no idea what this means.

320
00:13:23,315 --> 00:13:26,275
If anything, they might look down upon something that says,

321
00:13:26,395 --> 00:13:29,434
what does it say? It says us cyber trust mark.

322
00:13:29,445 --> 00:13:32,775
I might be like that sounds like some government spying crap on that thing.

323
00:13:32,784 --> 00:13:33,835
I'm not buying that

324
00:13:34,054 --> 00:13:37,364
right now. Sorry. Just to pause. You all have a security mark.

325
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:40,724
I remember they were working on that. I didn't know if they made it or not.

326
00:13:40,734 --> 00:13:41,364
That's cool.

327
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,325
Well, no, this one,

328
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:45,775
I just clicked around a product and it says it has an IOT security rating.

329
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,145
So the fact that you and I don't know about this,

330
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:51,630
I mean, and it already exists and you all have been doing it,

331
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,469
dude. I'm sorry, like we just proved your point.

332
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:57,869
Yeah, I agree. I agree. So, now

333
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:58,489
we have the

334
00:13:58,669 --> 00:13:59,390
question of

335
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:01,869
how do they spell IOT? Well, with two, I's

336
00:14:02,489 --> 00:14:03,659
iiot,

337
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:07,510
what does that mean? Industrial is an industrial iot maybe or something.

338
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,270
I don't know,

339
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,390
maybe. I don't know, whatever, whatever. Who cares? It doesn't matter.

340
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:12,030
So,

341
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:13,169
like

342
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:14,900
this is, this is the only way we

343
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,659
work.

344
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,229
This is what I feel like I feel like

345
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:19,869
the more I learn, the less I know,

346
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,030
like every day I learn something new and think everything is, is do.

347
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:25,450
Yeah.

348
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:31,159
So, ok, one thing to say. This says it is UWP 4.0 security enhanced.

349
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:33,679
Ok. Ok. Whatever.

350
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:36,719
Like no one knows what that means. No idea what this means exactly.

351
00:14:36,849 --> 00:14:39,640
And I'm Googling it. Google doesn't know what it means. Here's the point, right?

352
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,200
We've got this Trustmark,

353
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:45,280
let's say it's put on devices and let's say retailers say we're

354
00:14:45,289 --> 00:14:48,830
only gonna sell devices that have been through this program which,

355
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,840
you know, is ridiculous.

356
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:51,369
But let's pretend that's the case.

357
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:55,309
Now a device comes to us, right?

358
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,099
This is where I feel like things get weird with compute devices because let's

359
00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:05,260
say I buy a surge strip that the UL has done their business on

360
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,979
and they claim it's not gonna burn my house down.

361
00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:10,950
The number of things I can do to that third

362
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,299
strip to we'll say modify it in an unsafe manner.

363
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:17,570
It's not zero, but it's pretty low, right? I'm gonna plug

364
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:17,739
it

365
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,739
in. I'm gonna plug crap into the third strip. Like that's just what it does right

366
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:23,799
now. If I have a device though,

367
00:15:23,979 --> 00:15:27,409
you have installing apps on the device. Well, actually puzzle

368
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,010
an interpreter because actually a lot of the stuff

369
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,280
you can do to the search strip to damage it

370
00:15:32,549 --> 00:15:35,840
would in theory, for example, be caught by an arc fault circuit interrupter,

371
00:15:35,849 --> 00:15:39,000
which is now mandated by code for all bedrooms and living areas.

372
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,710
So it's almost as if we've learned from burning houses down that

373
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,900
well, you're not allowed to do that. So here's the thing though.

374
00:15:45,909 --> 00:15:48,419
I wonder about like secure devices. Ok.

375
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,789
So let's say I have a phone, let's say it has a cybertrust mark.

376
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:52,909
Let's say I install graphing

377
00:15:53,099 --> 00:15:53,700
Os on it.

378
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,489
What does that mean?

379
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,210
I would say that based on what I know of phones and the,

380
00:15:57,219 --> 00:16:01,020
the mix of hardware and software that, yeah, that, that mark no longer applies.

381
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:03,299
So that's like saying, I took a piece of food,

382
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,539
I took the meat,

383
00:16:04,645 --> 00:16:06,375
the hamburger and I put something totally different in.

384
00:16:06,385 --> 00:16:09,905
Does the nutritional label still apply? Well, I mean, that's fair.

385
00:16:10,034 --> 00:16:10,804
That's a good point.

386
00:16:11,364 --> 00:16:11,724
No,

387
00:16:12,155 --> 00:16:15,224
but I, I think devices are especially unique because

388
00:16:15,635 --> 00:16:17,534
how would, you know, let's say I, I

389
00:16:17,755 --> 00:16:17,864
gra

390
00:16:18,015 --> 00:16:18,104
you know,

391
00:16:18,284 --> 00:16:21,075
on the phone, I give you the phone, let's pick a light bulb, light

392
00:16:21,205 --> 00:16:21,405
bulb, light

393
00:16:21,604 --> 00:16:22,625
bulb, turn off even better

394
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:24,145
off

395
00:16:24,315 --> 00:16:26,065
talk Zigbee protocol.

396
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,929
You don't know what software is on there. Like you're not going to do a Rom dump.

397
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,729
Here's where I wonder about this also. So, ok, let's pretend I have my phone.

398
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,080
I don't install graphing.

399
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:36,690
O si keep the Google default

400
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,250
OS

401
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:39,309
with the secure trust mark, right? Of course,

402
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,169
I install a bunch of apps on it.

403
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,429
Like is it, is it very like can we, what can we say about that? At that point?

404
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,590
I think the intent behind this is going to be I buy a device

405
00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:54,570
and I know the creator of the device has taken reasonable actions

406
00:16:54,739 --> 00:16:58,700
to not release like a security Swiss cheese product. And

407
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,359
I'm going to get reasonable updates on the device.

408
00:17:01,369 --> 00:17:05,000
That is almost certainly what this is going to be about that and that would be useful.

409
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:08,969
And that a good example here is I look at Apple phones and I look at how many

410
00:17:08,979 --> 00:17:10,780
years of support they get from the day they

411
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,900
are released until like they're sort of last.

412
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,339
It's about 6 to 7 years.

413
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:18,108
I know that's why I bought it iphone Solid six years, about seven.

414
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,598
Whereas with a, with an Android based phone, everybody's like, oh,

415
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:23,170
you can buy a proper Google phone and they will

416
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,540
for sure support it for five or six years.

417
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,969
And I'm like, that is a great idea in theory. However, I live in Canada

418
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,119
and I cannot get the thing fixed if it breaks.

419
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,709
Interesting. Well, there's no Google stores here.

420
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,680
Right. That's one of the advantages of Apple.

421
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,290
If there's an Apple store, I can just take my phone there and get it fixed.

422
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,369
So if I'm traveling,

423
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,900
I'm way less stressed out about worrying about my phone

424
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,369
because there's like an Apple store wherever I go because I,

425
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,030
I go in cities. So I think this would be good

426
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:47,959
in that.

427
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,099
It would give

428
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,410
maybe a simpler way for a consumer to validate that. Oh, yeah.

429
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,630
Like historically, this vendor has given five years of updates or,

430
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,109
or even better this vendor has historically given updates for what would

431
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:03,199
be perceived to be a reasonable length of use of the product.

432
00:18:03,209 --> 00:18:05,270
So like I'm gonna go with phones, I'm gonna say five years,

433
00:18:05,449 --> 00:18:06,650
good. 10 years. That's,

434
00:18:06,939 --> 00:18:09,630
that's an old phone dishwashers on the other hand,

435
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,949
20 years.

436
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:11,750
So here's,

437
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,270
here's something in this article from Cyber scoop that I kind of want to read,

438
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:16,920
right?

439
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,989
It says, and this is just a, like I read the whole paragraph,

440
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,989
it says if your car explodes following a minor accident or if a table saw

441
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,229
comes loose and maims you or your light bulb overheats and causes a fire,

442
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:27,030
you can take the neglige

443
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,569
manufacture to court and recover your damages,

444
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,530
right? Blah, blah, blah.

445
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:34,829
But if an attacker hacks your smart home devices, let's say your Alexa

446
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,089
listens in on your private conversations.

447
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:39,770
You have little to no recourse against the manufacturer.

448
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:45,310
So that, I mean, that is a quote from, from the commissioner, an FCC commissioner,

449
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:48,660
right? That whole you can sue and get redress. No,

450
00:18:49,449 --> 00:18:51,400
not realistically in a lot of cases.

451
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,609
Well, if it, if it's written into law, I mean,

452
00:18:53,619 --> 00:18:56,310
it depends how damages are defined in law in the US.

453
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,359
At least that, that's,

454
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,280
that seems plausible, but I'm skeptical they'll probably go there with it for sure.

455
00:19:01,579 --> 00:19:02,739
Yeah, I mean, we,

456
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,280
we have that thing with car fires here in Canada where it turns out the

457
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:08,839
Mercedes cars where like there was a design defect and they were just catching fire

458
00:19:08,979 --> 00:19:10,219
and it took years

459
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,699
because transport, Canada doesn't like track all the vehicle fires.

460
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:16,439
And there's no, we've talked about this past on the show but they don't.

461
00:19:16,449 --> 00:19:18,239
There's no, so there's like that lack of correlation,

462
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,829
just like train accidents in the US.

463
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:21,300
NASA runs a program.

464
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,050
Nobody has joined it.

465
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:24,660
None of the train

466
00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:28,439
operators have, like they said they would join it a few years ago. But they

467
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,599
NASA like the, the space people,

468
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:32,729
they

469
00:19:33,729 --> 00:19:33,849
don't

470
00:19:33,979 --> 00:19:34,130
make the

471
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,920
trains or like they,

472
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:39,079
well, I guess they're experts in transport. I don't know.

473
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:41,180
Maybe they're good at blowing things up.

474
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:42,040
Yeah.

475
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,939
So really good at that.

476
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:48,099
That's the thing is like this, this idea of redress that I will. I'm sorry.

477
00:19:48,109 --> 00:19:51,060
But somebody hacks my Alexa because my Alexa is not secure.

478
00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:54,880
You're saying I have an honest to goodness chance to sue Amazon and get

479
00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:59,150
satisfaction. You probably don't. But let's ignore that part as well.

480
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,050
I just wanted to bring it up because I think it's an interesting point.

481
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,180
It's also a very American viewpoint of suing

482
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,589
because like most of the rest of the world doesn't do that

483
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:08,420
for

484
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,969
consumer safety laws.

485
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:10,640
And one thing,

486
00:20:11,219 --> 00:20:13,500
one thing I think that works is what Europe does,

487
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:16,109
where this device has to be fit for purpose.

488
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:19,890
And if not, you can return it not to the manufacturer, but to the person who

489
00:20:19,994 --> 00:20:21,694
sold it to you and get a refund.

490
00:20:21,864 --> 00:20:22,665
And now that works.

491
00:20:22,675 --> 00:20:26,064
Obviously if you're buying from like a store that's still there a year later which

492
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:28,795
most big stores like Circuit City best buy.

493
00:20:28,805 --> 00:20:31,984
I don't know what the German equivalents of these are. Circuit City is gone. Kurt.

494
00:20:32,555 --> 00:20:34,854
Oh, yeah. That's right. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. Good point.

495
00:20:34,974 --> 00:20:37,694
But I think laws like that because then

496
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:39,155
it's kind of like the Costco thing.

497
00:20:39,165 --> 00:20:42,484
Costco will basically, like you return anything within a year.

498
00:20:42,494 --> 00:20:44,494
They're like, this is ridiculous, but we'll do it

499
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:47,300
and if you abuse it, they'll fire you as a member,

500
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:47,969
which is

501
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:51,790
ok, we're off in the weeds. We need to pull ourselves back to the point.

502
00:20:51,869 --> 00:20:54,979
But the point is Costco picks reasonably not terrible stuff because they

503
00:20:54,989 --> 00:20:57,089
know they have that one year return window thing to deal with.

504
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:57,859
And I mean,

505
00:20:57,869 --> 00:21:02,234
that's an instance where a mark like this might be valuable to someone Costco,

506
00:21:02,255 --> 00:21:02,704
right?

507
00:21:02,714 --> 00:21:05,875
Where they might look at that and say, ok, this is a good thing.

508
00:21:05,885 --> 00:21:08,405
We want to make sure we're, we're selling this thing.

509
00:21:08,425 --> 00:21:10,864
I think it's more that lack of it is a bad thing.

510
00:21:11,074 --> 00:21:13,875
Sure. I don't think that the market itself is a good thing.

511
00:21:13,885 --> 00:21:17,915
I think it's like, like if something can't achieve even ac certification ul

512
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,930
Yeah, it's like, come on, what are you even doing

513
00:21:21,189 --> 00:21:23,569
the more I think about this, the weirder it gets

514
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:24,819
just because

515
00:21:24,989 --> 00:21:29,930
I feel like devices are so strange and I think something like

516
00:21:29,939 --> 00:21:34,670
this mark could apply up to the point it enters a person's premises

517
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:38,969
and I feel like it's almost like no holds barred after that.

518
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:42,589
Right. You have to, like, use it as intended and then no. Ok. No, no, no.

519
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:43,469
But that's the point.

520
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,599
That's the point. Use it as intended with digital devices, isn't it?

521
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:50,699
It, it's a tree of infinite branches.

522
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:54,569
I mean, you have to think about how many apps exist in the app store.

523
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:55,910
It's probably millions.

524
00:21:56,255 --> 00:21:58,194
And what are the combinations of those apps

525
00:21:58,204 --> 00:22:00,775
installed which obviously changes the way things work.

526
00:22:00,785 --> 00:22:03,324
And in theory it shouldn't. But you know what I mean? Like

527
00:22:03,535 --> 00:22:05,005
it's so weird.

528
00:22:05,334 --> 00:22:05,635
Well,

529
00:22:05,645 --> 00:22:08,665
and this also ignores Dieselgate where you could have a

530
00:22:08,675 --> 00:22:11,805
device test to the test when it's in testing mode

531
00:22:11,935 --> 00:22:12,474
and then

532
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,589
do other things to get.

533
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:14,969
Like I,

534
00:22:14,979 --> 00:22:18,250
I can't think of a specific phone example where you would like exhibit a security

535
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:22,150
behavior and then not do it later to somehow improve the experience or something.

536
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,410
OK? No, I I do have an example of this. So Graphene Os has has this.

537
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:30,430
So when I was reading the documentation on how Graphene works, they,

538
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,270
they do a bunch of like additional lockdown like

539
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,420
memory protections and all kinds of crazy stuff.

540
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,540
So that does impact performance. No, no.

541
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,030
The problem is there are apps that don't run with it

542
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,199
and so you can turn it off and they call it like compatibility mode or something.

543
00:22:44,209 --> 00:22:45,140
I forget the name of it,

544
00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:47,819
but it's better than calling it an insecure mode.

545
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:52,469
No, I'm serious. Right. It's compatibility mode, not insecure mode.

546
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:54,680
It's like WEP, uh, whatever.

547
00:22:54,689 --> 00:22:57,109
Like, you know, it's, it's incompatible mode for old devices.

548
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:59,560
Not, it's WEP, which can be cracked on.

549
00:22:59,569 --> 00:23:04,000
I was gonna say a laptop but just run an open A P at that point, at least, you know.

550
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:04,800
But,

551
00:23:05,229 --> 00:23:06,079
but you know what I mean?

552
00:23:06,089 --> 00:23:07,160
I mean, this is,

553
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,630
this is the thing I keep thinking about is there are

554
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,109
millions of configurations like what happens if we root a device?

555
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,040
What? And, and, and here's where it gets even weirder is

556
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:19,310
I know there are organizations in Europe that are

557
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:21,829
saying if a person buys a computing device,

558
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:24,280
they should have the ability to like build a new Os

559
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:26,430
and put it on there if the manufacturer isn't using it.

560
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:28,270
But now if we have people like rooting all

561
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,250
this stuff and doing all this wild modifications,

562
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:34,829
how can you possibly claim anything is even remotely certified to

563
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:38,640
anything and making it possible to root introduces security vulnerabilities?

564
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,040
Because like, well, if I can re

565
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,510
uh remotely and by remotely,

566
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:45,680
like not having like physical switches or jumper after bridge on the device,

567
00:23:45,689 --> 00:23:47,469
which is going to be the case with a phone, you know,

568
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:50,339
having some sort of way to do it like through USB or whatever.

569
00:23:50,349 --> 00:23:52,699
Well, that means an attacker can also probably do it right?

570
00:23:52,709 --> 00:23:55,160
This introduces the potential for backdoors and

571
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,979
for an attacker to hijack my device.

572
00:23:57,229 --> 00:23:57,810
And so,

573
00:23:57,959 --> 00:24:00,219
yeah, it's, it's, it's a, it's to quote,

574
00:24:00,609 --> 00:24:03,900
however, it's a hard problem to solve, I think what would be,

575
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,469
I'm going to take a step back and kind of

576
00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:06,939
go to where I've been going a lot more recently,

577
00:24:06,949 --> 00:24:07,420
which is,

578
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,550
I'm less concerned about the security side of

579
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,150
it and more concerned about things like,

580
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,369
can they and will they,

581
00:24:12,589 --> 00:24:15,810
can they ship an update that I can install in a prompt manner?

582
00:24:15,819 --> 00:24:18,290
Because none of this else matters because at some point

583
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,810
like Apple's been working on securing their phones forever,

584
00:24:21,189 --> 00:24:23,089
lots of vulnerabilities fixed.

585
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:26,479
They've got the advanced whatever they call it, the uh locked.

586
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,040
Yeah,

587
00:24:27,189 --> 00:24:29,060
where like basically disables everything.

588
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:32,130
Like you can't get messages or calls from people on your contact list.

589
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,969
You can't, you can't get multimedia.

590
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:36,170
What is it M MS stuff? You can't

591
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,280
like it just guts the functionality of the

592
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:40,209
phone to essentially reduce the attack surface,

593
00:24:40,219 --> 00:24:40,589
which

594
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:41,390
is fantastic.

595
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:41,959
But you know,

596
00:24:41,969 --> 00:24:44,959
if you're a journalist or certain types of work in certain areas of the world,

597
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,579
you basically get a dumb phone and, but it's secure and I just,

598
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:52,359
I keep coming back to like, I, I no longer, it's not that I don't care about security,

599
00:24:52,369 --> 00:24:54,949
but security is like more towards the finish line.

600
00:24:54,969 --> 00:24:58,439
And what I need now is I need the vendor to actually support the product. I mean,

601
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:01,640
you're probably right when you say that and, and

602
00:25:01,949 --> 00:25:02,959
that's kind of

603
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,300
not what I was thinking about here.

604
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,640
But you're actually right, because I think a lot of,

605
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,979
a lot of compute based devices

606
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:14,079
is they're, they're just not supported you, like, buy them and they, that's it.

607
00:25:14,089 --> 00:25:18,130
Like, what you get is what you get. They, they're never updated ever.

608
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,770
Yeah, I got some globe light bulbs from Costco.

609
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,689
They got, like, one or two software updates and

610
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:24,599
they just never worked reliably. So I actually didn't even return them.

611
00:25:24,609 --> 00:25:25,369
I just got rid of them.

612
00:25:25,819 --> 00:25:27,890
And then I went with Phillips Hughe as you know,

613
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,510
which actually do get software updates.

614
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,119
Like my printer,

615
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,180
like I was like my printer.

616
00:25:31,189 --> 00:25:32,729
Remember I checked on that show and I'm like, oh my God,

617
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:36,969
it's actually got a month old claims, a month old firmware update

618
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:37,770
or

619
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,449
software update or whatever it's called.

620
00:25:40,069 --> 00:25:41,939
And so that's what I'm buying.

621
00:25:41,949 --> 00:25:44,439
And I mean, and that's one of the advantages of the apple ecosystem, for example,

622
00:25:44,449 --> 00:25:45,729
is they have less stuff

623
00:25:46,099 --> 00:25:47,369
like they have, um,

624
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,560
they have a, a lineup of phones that actually fits on a web screen.

625
00:25:50,969 --> 00:25:52,729
And whereas Android, you've got

626
00:25:52,949 --> 00:25:57,579
thousands. Well, Android is, it's such a different model. I mean,

627
00:25:57,709 --> 00:25:59,819
you've got Google with their stuff,

628
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:03,839
but then they obviously you've got Samsung phones, you've got LG phones,

629
00:26:03,849 --> 00:26:06,000
you've got one off, no name phones.

630
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:07,609
Whenever I walk by the cell phone,

631
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:11,079
kiosk, there's got to be at least 100 Android phones that all look very different.

632
00:26:11,449 --> 00:26:13,109
Yeah, probably. And they're super different.

633
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:14,719
Four Apple phones.

634
00:26:14,939 --> 00:26:15,430
That's it, like

635
00:26:15,709 --> 00:26:16,949
four Apple phones.

636
00:26:17,329 --> 00:26:18,180
They don't, they,

637
00:26:18,189 --> 00:26:21,880
at least when I go to Best Buy the Apple stuff is like all I have in the,

638
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:26,469
in the corner in the back, like, away from the normal cell phone stuff.

639
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,680
But I mean,

640
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,099
and to be honest,

641
00:26:29,109 --> 00:26:32,589
so that's why I buy apples now is ironically you pay a lot more upfront

642
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,770
but you get the 567 years of guarantee. Sure. Sure. Sure, sure.

643
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,329
My kids are rocking iphone eights.

644
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:42,689
I mean, look, the thing to remember though is that like, not every company is Apple.

645
00:26:42,699 --> 00:26:44,530
They can't work like that. Right.

646
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:45,109
Yeah.

647
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,810
And, and it's definitely,

648
00:26:46,829 --> 00:26:49,910
but there are brands and vendors that are starting to do that.

649
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,130
Like Phillips hue they seem,

650
00:26:51,229 --> 00:26:53,250
be supporting their light bulbs with software updates.

651
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,800
Knock on wood. Yeah, more, it's more money up front.

652
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:58,170
But it's, I guess it's like, it's like buying a car.

653
00:26:58,369 --> 00:27:00,410
I made the mistake of buying a Kia.

654
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:03,770
And why do I say it's a mistake is because they are produced in South Korea.

655
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,449
There is no, all the parts are produced in South Korea there.

656
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:09,869
It's not like buying a Ford or a Dodge or something

657
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,650
in North America where there are other companies making compatible parts.

658
00:27:15,209 --> 00:27:17,430
I did not know that. But yeah, that would be annoying.

659
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,280
But like, so with when it comes to Kia,

660
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:22,239
I ha I have to get parts from the dealership who gets parts from Korea.

661
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:23,400
Sure.

662
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:24,010
There's, it's

663
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,439
really expensive.

664
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,599
Yes, I, there was a part I bought,

665
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:30,599
it was the wrong part but it was like 25 bucks from Korea.

666
00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:31,369
Plus shipping

667
00:27:31,479 --> 00:27:35,199
and it was 500 bucks locally and it was the wrong one. But I, you know, 25 bucks.

668
00:27:35,209 --> 00:27:36,000
So I'm like, ok, that,

669
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,369
that,

670
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:37,430
so

671
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:39,229
it's a solenoid, right?

672
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:43,079
So it should only be 25 bucks. A $500 solenoid. Jeez,

673
00:27:43,199 --> 00:27:44,530
what your options are,

674
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,239
buy it from us or

675
00:27:46,449 --> 00:27:48,280
get it from Korea. Good luck with that.

676
00:27:49,239 --> 00:27:50,910
I'm actually gonna end up paying the dealership

677
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,810
because the thing is the dealership is also not

678
00:27:52,819 --> 00:27:56,229
gonna take my solenoids even if it's the correct one and like replace the part for me.

679
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,640
They're gonna be like, no, we won't do that.

680
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,369
Well, you could probably find a mechanic anyway.

681
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,550
We're, we're in the weeds, we're in the weeds.

682
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,010
I could find a mechanic that would do it, but not a dealership.

683
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:07,329
And this speaks to this exact problem with these phones and everything where like I,

684
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:08,599
with a phone

685
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:10,209
that's really not an option,

686
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:13,390
like component level repair of a phone nowadays.

687
00:28:13,709 --> 00:28:14,770
I mean, it exists.

688
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,949
You've got these, uh, uh,

689
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:19,619
like I fix it type places right where you can bring your phone

690
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:23,189
into like a shop at the mall and they'll fix your screen.

691
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:23,750
Yes.

692
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,400
And the last time I looked at that is they wanted $900 to replace the

693
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:30,849
screen on the ipad Pro and it was $1200 to buy an entirely new one.

694
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,479
That could be for the ipad.

695
00:28:32,489 --> 00:28:33,459
I know my wife had,

696
00:28:33,469 --> 00:28:37,300
she brought her phone to one of those places to replace the screen and it was, I mean,

697
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,910
it was like 100 bucks, which I thought was, was fine.

698
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,310
And maybe that is true for the more common

699
00:28:42,869 --> 00:28:44,310
kind of, more common things. But,

700
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,089
well, I should also, it was just the glass, it wasn't like the,

701
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:49,869
the display or anything and the ipads could be different.

702
00:28:49,939 --> 00:28:50,530
I don't know.

703
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:51,079
I don't know.

704
00:28:51,089 --> 00:28:52,010
Well, the other thing is,

705
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:56,030
I've also had a friend who took their phone to one of those ifixit place whatevers

706
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:56,910
and

707
00:28:57,099 --> 00:28:59,900
they destroyed her phone and gave her a replacement

708
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,609
that had half as much storage and we're like,

709
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:01,839
too bad.

710
00:29:02,619 --> 00:29:06,229
I'm not surprised by that actually. And that's the problem is it's a hit or miss.

711
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:08,130
You might get a really great car mechanic

712
00:29:08,589 --> 00:29:11,589
and you might get a car mechanic and your wheels fall off a block later.

713
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:13,189
That's always been a problem, right?

714
00:29:13,199 --> 00:29:15,829
Like the, in the history of cars that's always been an issue.

715
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:19,479
Ideally what this mark is doing is trying to say, like, look, this is a good mechanic.

716
00:29:19,489 --> 00:29:22,430
This is a bad mechanic. This is a good product. This is a bad product.

717
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,219
And

718
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,150
that's,

719
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:27,869
and I want this, I want more of this. We need to have this kind of maturity.

720
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,290
Like,

721
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,900
I worry that there's not even a hint of what they'd be testing for or looking for,

722
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:32,849
to assign this mark.

723
00:29:32,859 --> 00:29:35,369
Like, well, that's how we're gonna end this show because we've been talking,

724
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,790
I feel like in circles about

725
00:29:37,239 --> 00:29:37,260
the,

726
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:40,420
the same thing for, for half an hour.

727
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:41,599
But you're right. Like

728
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,099
we're pretending

729
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:47,540
all of the actually hard problems have been answered and we

730
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:51,579
haven't answered any of those and it's still a ridiculous conversation.

731
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:52,180
I mean,

732
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,579
we're pretending that we know the answers and we

733
00:29:54,589 --> 00:29:56,390
haven't even figured out what the questions are.

734
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,729
No, no, we haven't. This is gonna be,

735
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:01,699
this is gonna be wild. I think. I don't,

736
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,839
I don't know what's going to come of this. I guess.

737
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:06,489
Here's, here's the one thing I'll say, here's how I'm going to end.

738
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,939
This is my final comment on this topic, whatever the FCC does,

739
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:11,359
it's gonna suck.

740
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:12,599
We know that,

741
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:13,920
but that's ok

742
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:17,439
because you have to start somewhere and it's ok to suck.

743
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:20,040
It's just as long as they, they make a point to say, we know what,

744
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:23,130
this sucks and we're gonna work on it like that's the key, right.

745
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,209
The problem is we also, we just stuck with a bad standard for two decades.

746
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:29,280
I hope not. But it is

747
00:30:29,479 --> 00:30:30,170
possible.

748
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,410
I, I think it will have to change because like, I sent you that link to like,

749
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,810
those water facilities being attacked in the US.

750
00:30:35,819 --> 00:30:38,439
Like IOT that controls skater systems that

751
00:30:38,449 --> 00:30:40,739
controls life critical stuff like water power.

752
00:30:41,459 --> 00:30:44,900
We have to change because like, I, I, my city went through the whole, like, oh,

753
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,040
we might not have water.

754
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:48,989
Oops, it's a little scary. Like there were a lot of people who were freaked out

755
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,339
because it should be, you literally can't live without water and you can,

756
00:30:52,349 --> 00:30:53,449
it's pretty important.

757
00:30:53,589 --> 00:30:56,489
Like where are we going to truck and clean water for a million people? From

758
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:59,680
nowhere? For not so much.

759
00:30:59,689 --> 00:31:01,800
I don't care about consumer devices as much as

760
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,890
I do about these kind of back end things.

761
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:07,369
And I, I think there is where this is going to start impacting because

762
00:31:07,859 --> 00:31:10,680
it's getting bad enough that we can no longer ignore it.

763
00:31:10,819 --> 00:31:11,780
I mean, I agree.

764
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,719
I don't, I don't think this is, I mean,

765
00:31:13,729 --> 00:31:16,349
this FCC thing is specifically for consumer devices.

766
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:19,890
Let's hope they do something maybe a little more sane for that level.

767
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:23,359
But yeah, I mean, I don't know, I'm just, I'm, I'm gonna end this one. I,

768
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:26,040
every freaking time I feel like we try talking about

769
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,030
one of these things we just end up with like

770
00:31:28,439 --> 00:31:31,540
the problem is harder than any of us imagined.

771
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,280
Well, if it wasn't, it would have been solved, I guess

772
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:35,209
I

773
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:35,510
bias

774
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:36,199
why

775
00:31:36,449 --> 00:31:36,589
we, so

776
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:37,390
this problem yet.

777
00:31:37,739 --> 00:31:39,310
Well, because it's really hard

778
00:31:40,239 --> 00:31:42,630
and, and I guess on the plus side,

779
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:46,869
at least we're, we're looking at it and talking about it, which is really important.

780
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,729
So, all right, I'm calling it. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you very much for listening.
