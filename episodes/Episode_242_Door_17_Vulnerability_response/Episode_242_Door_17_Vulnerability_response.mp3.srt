0
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:00,300
I here

1
00:00:00,449 --> 00:00:00,610
record

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,710
-- December 17th. What
-- is vulnerability

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,400
response? That's a great question.

4
00:00:05,409 --> 00:00:06,380
I have no idea. No,

5
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:08,489
that's what I do like every day, all day.

6
00:00:08,569 --> 00:00:11,470
No, no, this is a great topic actually in all seriousness.

7
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:14,310
So the way I would describe this is if you have a

8
00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:16,989
product or a service and it used to just be a product,

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,030
but now we have services.

10
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,670
What happens is

11
00:00:20,139 --> 00:00:23,639
there are going to be security vulnerabilities in your stuff.

12
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,930
Be it again, a service or a product, something you wrote.

13
00:00:27,049 --> 00:00:27,280
Well,

14
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,340
and it might be your stuff or it might be stuff that you pulled

15
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,959
in from somewhere else or it might be stuff you're running on top of

16
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:34,939
-- or an interaction,
-- right? There's basically anything.

17
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,840
And now the number one rule here that I

18
00:00:36,849 --> 00:00:39,080
don't think everyone understands all the time but is,

19
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,330
is imperative is

20
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,439
if you ship it, you support it.

21
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,900
So just because I downloaded something off github doesn't

22
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:46,400
mean I can say it's not my problem.

23
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:48,279
It is my problem because I'm

24
00:00:48,391 --> 00:00:49,832
using it and I'm shipping it.

25
00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:52,422
And that's part of the beauty of having access to this open

26
00:00:52,431 --> 00:00:54,701
source library is you get to make that trade off of,

27
00:00:54,712 --> 00:00:56,942
we can build it in house and maintain it poorly or we

28
00:00:56,951 --> 00:01:00,251
can download it and not maintain it at all and bite that,

29
00:01:00,262 --> 00:01:01,661
you know, take that risk on.

30
00:01:01,672 --> 00:01:05,781
-- So
-- what, what, what happens is obviously there's a security vulnerability

31
00:01:05,942 --> 00:01:10,972
and maybe there's a CV E ID, maybe it doesn't, whatever. What do you do?

32
00:01:11,111 --> 00:01:15,132
If you get a report from somewhere? It could be from a security researcher.

33
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:16,522
It could be from a bug bounty, it could

34
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:19,384
-- from a security scanner, I would
-- say at a minimum,

35
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:21,573
the two biggest things you try to do,

36
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:24,884
you push it upstream and you notify the user community.

37
00:01:25,024 --> 00:01:27,304
Well, if you, if you can push it upstream, right,

38
00:01:27,314 --> 00:01:30,353
which essentially is a polite way of saying pull the fire alarm.

39
00:01:30,363 --> 00:01:31,384
I mean, no, no, no, no, no, no.

40
00:01:31,393 --> 00:01:35,524
-- You should never say pull the fire alarm because there are no, no,
-- no, I mean, ok,

41
00:01:35,533 --> 00:01:36,863
that's a bad now.

42
00:01:36,874 --> 00:01:40,994
But what I'm trying to say is you make it known to the people who need to know.

43
00:01:41,064 --> 00:01:44,713
Yeah, you tell people what they need to know. Absolutely. And I like to

44
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:48,365
on the side of just like obnoxiously full,

45
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:51,026
disclosing all of the information because the

46
00:01:51,036 --> 00:01:53,276
reality is if you hold something back,

47
00:01:53,286 --> 00:01:55,155
a someone who cares can find it

48
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:00,435
and what if, if you're hiding important details. That's a really big story.

49
00:02:00,445 --> 00:02:02,305
Here's what I find super offensive about that

50
00:02:02,316 --> 00:02:05,526
whole full versus not full disclosure thing is

51
00:02:05,655 --> 00:02:10,795
if some one individual or team found that security flaw, then by definition,

52
00:02:10,805 --> 00:02:13,076
it is findable and other people can do it.

53
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:15,320
Therefore, it cannot be.

54
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,119
I accept that in this universe, there are probably answers we cannot find,

55
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:22,970
you know, to the fundamental, you know, truth of physics or whatever.

56
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,649
And those are just things that cannot be found.

57
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,649
But by definition, if somebody found a security flaw,

58
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,330
somebody else can find that security flaw.

59
00:02:28,339 --> 00:02:30,789
And we've seen this happen, you know, with the hardware vulnerabilities where

60
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:34,270
a team found it. And then a week later, independent discovery of it happened,

61
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:34,649
you know,

62
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,559
the same thing happened in science with

63
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,160
a whole bunch of radioactive related discovery,

64
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:41,800
you know, prior to world war, I, I, where the whole thing just took off.

65
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,309
So there's, if anyone listening,

66
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:50,050
-- nosy, I believe this phenomenon has a name. I've tried to find it and I
-- can't.

67
00:02:50,059 --> 00:02:52,490
Well, independent discovery was my understanding.

68
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:55,610
I'm sure it has some fancier name than that. That's boring.

69
00:02:55,619 --> 00:03:00,050
But, yeah, this happens all the time where like a great example is calculus, right?

70
00:03:00,059 --> 00:03:00,330
You had

71
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:03,979
-- Leans and Newton both inventing calculus at the same time.
-- Ah,

72
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,009
multiple discovery. What's it called?

73
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,009
It's called multiple discovery or simultaneous invention.

74
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,169
-- Well, that's a stupid name. I want it to have a cool name.
-- Sorry.

75
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,119
Let's call it the secrecy paradox. That's its new name. OK.

76
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,110
The secrecy paradox. That's what I'm calling it.

77
00:03:19,309 --> 00:03:21,559
There's no such thing as secrecy. That's the paradox.

78
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:21,919
But

79
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,039
anyway, anyway, like, yeah, this is, this is,

80
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,990
I've seen this so many times where one person reports a security vulnerability

81
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:30,070
and then like,

82
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,970
three days later someone else reports it and I remember there was one

83
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,949
time I thought it was the same person trying to mess with me

84
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:39,630
and, and finally I'm like, wait a minute, are you this guy? And they're like,

85
00:03:39,735 --> 00:03:42,035
no, who's that? I'm like, holy crap.

86
00:03:42,044 --> 00:03:44,875
And it was some, like, crazy, complicated security issue.

87
00:03:44,884 --> 00:03:48,764
And I'm like, how did two people figure this out at the same time?

88
00:03:48,774 --> 00:03:50,595
It was, it was insane. Yeah.

89
00:03:50,604 --> 00:03:52,595
-- No,
-- by definition, if people can find these things,

90
00:03:52,604 --> 00:03:54,895
then by definition people can find these things.

91
00:03:54,904 --> 00:03:55,205
Yeah.

92
00:03:55,214 --> 00:03:59,414
And I guess my advice for anyone doing this kind of work is just always err on the

93
00:03:59,425 --> 00:04:02,955
side of openness because I think the historical mindset

94
00:04:02,964 --> 00:04:05,414
and security was to err on the side of secrecy

95
00:04:05,809 --> 00:04:10,190
and I don't think that has done anyone any favors and I am completely confident

96
00:04:10,369 --> 00:04:15,139
-- that that attitude has held our industry back for decades.
-- Absolutely.

97
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:17,600
-- Yeah.
-- I mean, it's a hard problem

98
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,390
but whatever, whatever.

99
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:24,730
And I guess the one other thing while I don't think it is strictly imperative to do it.

100
00:04:24,739 --> 00:04:30,390
Get a cve, I, if you can because it makes everyone else's life just so much easier.

101
00:04:30,529 --> 00:04:30,709
Yeah.

102
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,809
I'm currently dealing with a major project where I want to get an inventory of all

103
00:04:35,015 --> 00:04:38,915
security vulnerabilities that they fixed over the last year or two and they can't,

104
00:04:39,005 --> 00:04:40,154
because they don't see v

105
00:04:40,554 --> 00:04:41,554
and the response is, well,

106
00:04:41,565 --> 00:04:43,795
it's in our bug tracker and sometimes there's a security tag,

107
00:04:43,804 --> 00:04:45,315
but probably not always.

108
00:04:45,325 --> 00:04:47,255
-- And I'm like, well, ok, there's my
-- answer.

109
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:50,515
I mean, right. The answer is you're bad at this. Right. That's the answer.

110
00:04:50,575 --> 00:04:53,674
That's anyway. Anyway, what's the date today?

111
00:04:53,924 --> 00:04:55,954
Uh. Right. Cool. All right.

112
00:04:56,325 --> 00:04:59,475
That wraps up December 17th onto December 18th.
