Hello and welcome to the open source Security podcast episode 58 with myself,

1
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,260
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:11,810
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:12,750
What's New Kurt?

4
00:00:13,609 --> 00:00:17,059
-- I spent a couple of days at the cabin. It was nice.
-- That sounds fantastic.

5
00:00:17,069 --> 00:00:21,889
I, I have a terrible cold today, so I'm going to apologize in advance for my, no doubt,

6
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:22,909
silly sounding voice.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,950
But, yeah, out of nowhere I woke up this morning and,

8
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:27,540
and I'm sick and it's summer and this is ridiculous.

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,280
I don't know what it is. I think it's

10
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:29,959
international air

11
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:31,510
travel or something because,

12
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:31,879
no,

13
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,259
seriously, I don't remember as a kid.

14
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,130
Anybody ever being sick except like in fall and spring.

15
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:36,659
Uh,

16
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,520
yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That, that seems about

17
00:00:38,669 --> 00:00:38,779
right.

18
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:40,229
Nobody had colds in

19
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,119
summer.

20
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,799
I, I remember getting one once when I was very young and it was terrible.

21
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:48,610
It was probably some horrible plague or something.

22
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,599
Anyway. Anyway, I'll survive

23
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:52,259
no rest for the wicked. Right.

24
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,369
Oh, man. It has been a week, hasn't it?

25
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,180
Yeah.

26
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,630
Yeah. No, it's, uh,

27
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:00,849
where do you even start?

28
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:05,830
I guess with the guy who probably shouldn't have advertised and

29
00:01:05,839 --> 00:01:08,809
sold hacking tools online and then made a big name for himself

30
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,050
and gone to the US.

31
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,309
You know, that one, I'm going,

32
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,879
there's still a lot of details to that story. I don't understand and, and

33
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:22,180
rather than necessarily pass judgment on anyone one way or the other, I,

34
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,919
I think we should wait and see how it plays out.

35
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,900
But I think that the one bit of commentary I would have here is

36
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:27,279
I,

37
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:32,199
I feel like the authorities could have done a slightly better job here of explaining

38
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:35,839
-- what the heck is going on because I feel like they've been very
-- quiet.

39
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,419
Why would they care?

40
00:01:37,629 --> 00:01:41,099
-- I mean, our opinion literally does not matter.
-- Well, it does though.

41
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,970
And, and the reason is I, I think it was the GRG talked about this.

42
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,370
I, I don't remember for sure. So if it was someone else, I apologize. But

43
00:01:48,589 --> 00:01:49,510
basically,

44
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,739
when you're looking at the way law

45
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,900
enforcement works today in the security universe,

46
00:01:55,269 --> 00:01:57,750
there's a certain amount of trust and goodwill they need

47
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,980
to count on from the members of the community.

48
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,099
And when you do something like this,

49
00:02:02,269 --> 00:02:04,419
even when it's for a good reason,

50
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,500
you can't just be quiet because you're burning your goodwill right now.

51
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:10,788
And so there's going to be people who aren't going to

52
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,860
work with them in the future for a variety of reasons

53
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,160
because of this.

54
00:02:15,649 --> 00:02:17,880
-- And,
-- well, the problem is though legally though, you know,

55
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:20,119
you're in that sort of no comment phase,

56
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,479
but I don't even think they've done that.

57
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:26,339
It, it doesn't sound like they're, they're saying literally anything.

58
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,820
Well, I mean, there's a pretty, I mean, well, the indictment,

59
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:29,960
as I understand it is pretty clear.

60
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,520
It's for the, um, oh, what's the name of the tools again?

61
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:33,919
I

62
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:34,570
Kronos. Kronos.

63
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:35,500
Thank you, Kronos

64
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,399
with a K, that's what it was.

65
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,490
And, I mean, you know,

66
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,050
we have on the one side that people are like, well, you know,

67
00:02:42,059 --> 00:02:45,240
if you write hacking tools, you shouldn't get arrested for that.

68
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:48,330
And on the other side, you know,

69
00:02:48,339 --> 00:02:50,149
you have people who would cheerfully put everybody

70
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,130
who wrote anything remotely resembling a hack to

71
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:54,470
hacking tool into a tree chipper

72
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,630
and then, you know, somewhat more in the middle.

73
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:57,449
We have the, well,

74
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,199
maybe you shouldn't write hacking tools and advertise them as such

75
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:03,720
and, you know, be like, yeah, you can use these to break

76
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,770
the banks and stuff and like, here's the support number

77
00:03:06,929 --> 00:03:09,710
it rings to my cell phone or, you know, or whatever. Right? Because

78
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,309
I

79
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,449
think in a lot of cases, a reasonable case could be made in front of a judge that,

80
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:20,009
you know, maybe you're not just kind of a, you know, blameless hacking tool maker,

81
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,360
but you're actually kind of,

82
00:03:22,089 --> 00:03:27,360
-- uh, either colluding or, you know, getting really involved or,
-- right.

83
00:03:27,369 --> 00:03:30,639
But you've already ventured into the realm of guilty,

84
00:03:30,649 --> 00:03:33,570
not guilty versus just the fact that I don't feel like law

85
00:03:34,529 --> 00:03:36,770
guilty or not guilty. I'm just pointing out that though.

86
00:03:36,779 --> 00:03:37,990
It's, you know, there's, there's,

87
00:03:38,369 --> 00:03:39,910
uh, like Theodore wrote N map.

88
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:41,440
Right. Awesome tool.

89
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:45,169
Probably one of the most used hack, quote unquote hacking tools out there. Right.

90
00:03:45,179 --> 00:03:47,429
Because what's the first thing anybody does end map scan

91
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,199
good or bad. Right.

92
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,570
-- Yeah,
-- exactly.

93
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,220
You know, but, like, he's never,

94
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:57,130
I mean, I hate to say it but a lot of times, like, perception is reality,

95
00:03:57,309 --> 00:03:57,490
it's

96
00:03:58,089 --> 00:03:58,809
reality.

97
00:03:58,990 --> 00:03:59,210
Yeah.

98
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,830
And so, you know, I wouldn't go out and advertise, you know, something is like,

99
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:06,889
you know, use this to break into banks and steal their money,

100
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:07,899
you know,

101
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:10,369
because that's just probably not going to end well ever.

102
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:11,270
But,

103
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:15,179
but we're still talking about guilty or not guilty versus the fact that I feel

104
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:20,738
like the law enforcement universe should be doing a slightly better job of a,

105
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,850
at least making sure people understand what's going on.

106
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:25,510
Yeah.

107
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:27,459
But the thing to remember too is, for example,

108
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:32,049
if they want your cooper operation in many jurisdictions, they can just compel it

109
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:35,350
with a warrant or a national security letter.

110
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:39,929
Yes. And what they didn't do that, they arrested a dude.

111
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:40,290
-- No, no,
-- no,

112
00:04:40,299 --> 00:04:41,059
no, no, no, no, no,

113
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:44,269
we don't know that they haven't done it because again,

114
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:46,100
some of those things are by their nature.

115
00:04:46,109 --> 00:04:46,709
Secret.

116
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,940
-- Ok.
-- Look

117
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:52,100
like we don't know. That's part of the problem we enter that rabbit hole of like,

118
00:04:52,239 --> 00:04:56,149
maybe it's the lizard man or maybe it's just like, really poor pr, who knows?

119
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,670
I think if you've arrested someone, it's fair to say that

120
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,679
they're being pressured to cooper.

121
00:05:02,309 --> 00:05:05,989
I, I don't think there's any denying that whether they do or not is another story.

122
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,019
But fundamentally,

123
00:05:07,309 --> 00:05:11,170
I think when you have a dude who comes to the United States for a hacking conference,

124
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:13,869
he's relatively well known in the community and

125
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,850
you just up and arrest him and say nothing

126
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:20,649
that burns goodwill, whether right or wrong it burns goodwill.

127
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,450
And that's the truth of the matter, right?

128
00:05:23,049 --> 00:05:26,589
Well, the thing too is we can't treat law enforcement like one single entity.

129
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,670
-- But
-- we do,

130
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,279
we do look at, look at, you know, even within,

131
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:34,260
say the FBI or within the US marshals or because that's, I mean,

132
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:36,149
there's the first thing, there's, there's multiple

133
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,970
entities in the US that enforce these, a

134
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,309
variety of these laws.

135
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:42,839
They all have different

136
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:46,000
agendas and, and cultures, for example.

137
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:49,880
Um And even within them, I mean, you look at some places like the FBI like,

138
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,420
uh I remember watching the, the documentary on Ruby Ridge, right?

139
00:05:53,429 --> 00:05:57,140
It was this horrible mess of FBI meets, you know, kind of

140
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,859
uh family living in the wilderness in the cabin with

141
00:06:00,869 --> 00:06:03,339
guns and it just went all the way south fast

142
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:07,010
and even within the FBI, you know, there's like the people are kind of like, well,

143
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:09,420
you know, he should have behaved himself and blah, blah, blah and,

144
00:06:09,429 --> 00:06:12,619
and on the far other side, there's like the FBI people are like, wow,

145
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,019
we really screwed this one up.

146
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:17,250
Like I can't, like we did the worst possible job ever,

147
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:22,609
-- you know, and everything in between two.
-- Yes. And you're always going to have that.

148
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:23,559
However,

149
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:28,700
here's the difference is nobody is expecting the family members of the

150
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:32,049
Ruby Ridge people to ever help the FBI in the future,

151
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,989
the FBI or whatever organization may have picked this

152
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,519
guy up because even that isn't totally clear,

153
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:42,899
they're going to need help from the community at some point.

154
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,950
Be it employees,

155
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,350
be it help with figuring some botnet out or some piece of malware or something

156
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:52,890
and, and they're burning their goodwill and that's my whole point,

157
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,709
right or wrong, right? Just don't burn your goodwill.

158
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,160
But here's a question.

159
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,899
Do we know that the community is actually really

160
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,839
been helping law enforcement with this kind of stuff?

161
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:02,850
-- I can,
-- I

162
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:03,570
don't

163
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:03,779
know,

164
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:03,890
I

165
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,690
-- honestly don't know
-- there's a certain amount of cooper

166
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,239
that happens, I think and,

167
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,329
and I'm not saying they're like going out to black hats and saying, you know, hey,

168
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:12,679
dude, come help me out here.

169
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:14,450
But I do know that there's,

170
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:17,489
there's various organizations and various companies

171
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,670
that will help law enforcement.

172
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:18,839
I mean,

173
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,750
you always hear about like Microsoft working with

174
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,989
some group to take down some botnet or,

175
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,619
or some hacking group or whatever, right.

176
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,390
There's always something going on like that

177
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,410
and my point is that

178
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:33,769
if, if you burn enough goodwill and I'm not even saying they burned at all yet,

179
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,600
just if you burn enough,

180
00:07:35,609 --> 00:07:39,140
you'll eventually hit a point where literally nobody wants to work with you.

181
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:39,570
Right.

182
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,350
I, well, I mean, look at one good extreme example of this would be the NSA.

183
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:46,959
Right.

184
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,320
They've burned quite a bit of goodwill as I understand it, you know,

185
00:07:50,329 --> 00:07:52,480
with various spying programs and stuff

186
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:55,230
and they seem to be doing fine.

187
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,640
I have no idea. II, I didn't know how they were doing before this.

188
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:01,850
I don't know how they're doing afterwards. It's,

189
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:04,809
and maybe you're right. Maybe it doesn't matter

190
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,809
and, and maybe they can do this. But, but I feel like

191
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,190
they, they've made a tactical error on this one.

192
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,470
I think they certainly could have handled it

193
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,929
more gracefully.

194
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,209
Definitely.

195
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:20,529
But, I mean, I kind of wondered again, does it matter? I don't know. I really don't.

196
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:22,720
And, and I guess they must think it doesn't

197
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:23,850
if they,

198
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:27,649
or they're just, they made a mistake or somebody, you know,

199
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,119
because that's the other thing too is we're,

200
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,489
we're sort of ascribing intent to this when it could just be like,

201
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,929
just a clerical error,

202
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:35,419
like,

203
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:35,849
seriously

204
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,440
clerical error, man.

205
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:40,409
Well, you get what I'm saying, like in the sense of like,

206
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:44,809
we didn't do a proper press release to announce, you know, we've, it's possible,

207
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,169
you know, or the guy was sick that week or, you know, who knows? Right.

208
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:48,739
Like, I,

209
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,640
it always amazes me because I have worked for

210
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,369
the government for a brief period of six months.

211
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:52,799
And, like,

212
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:58,330
yeah, there, I mean, like, the fact that people think JFK could have been, you know,

213
00:08:58,359 --> 00:09:01,200
assassinated and that kept a secret for, like, 40 years.

214
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,489
Like, are you kidding me?

215
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:03,590
Like,

216
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,109
like NASA faked the moon landings and, like,

217
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,390
nobody leaked

218
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:07,869
it.

219
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:12,799
-- No, that's not how large organizations work.
-- I know exactly what you mean.

220
00:09:12,809 --> 00:09:14,669
You can't keep anything secret.

221
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,669
Well, like the whole look at the whole diesel exhaust thing, you know

222
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,450
the

223
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,659
the cheating on the diesel exhaust emissions tests and

224
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:26,520
all these things. Right? They, they eventually come to light typically.

225
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,239
Yeah,

226
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:27,880
always

227
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,320
-- it's
-- on the flip side,

228
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,729
there could be lizard been running everything

229
00:09:30,739 --> 00:09:32,609
who actually are good at keeping secrets and

230
00:09:32,619 --> 00:09:36,119
-- will never know if
-- there are like you guys could do a better job,

231
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,400
I think right now because I'm not happy with the state of things.

232
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:39,719
So

233
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,349
overlords like get your act together. Alright.

234
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,849
Alright. Anyway, let's move on, let's move on.

235
00:09:46,859 --> 00:09:48,440
This is, well, I guess we'll find out,

236
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,979
I'm sure in the coming weeks we'll have more to discuss this

237
00:09:51,109 --> 00:09:51,159
time.

238
00:09:52,239 --> 00:09:55,960
Probably. Unfortunately I feel bad for anyone incarcerated because I'm

239
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,469
from, from what I've seen,

240
00:09:57,479 --> 00:10:00,909
it's just like years of pain in many instances which isn't,

241
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,469
well, especially, I mean, he's, this is not his country

242
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:07,520
-- that too, right? He's from the UK. So
-- I'm not,

243
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,380
I, I couldn't imagine being arrested in a foreign country. It's got to be miserable

244
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,630
and it can't be fun and I imagine it's expensive.

245
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,469
I,

246
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,109
yeah. Right. I, I, right. Exactly.

247
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,909
Anyway, anyway,

248
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,390
how about something cheerful and happy, like, stealing credentials?

249
00:10:25,479 --> 00:10:28,330
Have nothing cheerful and happy to ever talk about.

250
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,630
If we did it would, wouldn't be called, the security

251
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,270
-- is killing TLS.
-- That's

252
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:37,429
really good news. I'll agree with that. I am so excited to see them doing that. It's,

253
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,030
it made my day

254
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:40,030
when I read that.

255
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:42,469
I

256
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:42,840
mean,

257
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,530
-- the, the, you
-- know,

258
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:49,109
I mean TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are definitely better than SSL,

259
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,349
but they, they TLS 1.01 0.1 definitely

260
00:10:53,609 --> 00:10:54,750
need to die.

261
00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:57,219
And I think the email points out beautifully, like,

262
00:10:57,229 --> 00:10:59,669
look open SSL has had this for like five years

263
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,340
and I mean, virtually all the other SSL,

264
00:11:02,349 --> 00:11:06,000
NTLS implementations have had this for like the better part of half a decade now.

265
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,969
And so, yeah. No, it's time to say goodbye. I like

266
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,789
and II, I get that.

267
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,750
It's hard because there's some like older versions of

268
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,330
JA and stuff that don't have good support.

269
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,559
-- But I
-- disagree with you. Here's the thing.

270
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:24,039
If you need these horrible legacy protocols, you need to be taking

271
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:29,770
uh incredible steps to support those meaning you're sent standing up like virtual

272
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:33,239
networks and you're standing up old V MS locked down in certain ways.

273
00:11:33,489 --> 00:11:35,000
This isn't one of those.

274
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,840
Oh, let's just support it because we can't,

275
00:11:36,849 --> 00:11:41,429
because we used to think that way and we got ourselves in a ton of trouble.

276
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,229
Backwards compatibility to the point of insanity is

277
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,630
a terrible,

278
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:48,309
the thing is though,

279
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,609
I see a lot of software and hardware manufacturers that put stuff in the field

280
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,469
and nobody wants to spend money updating or upgrading it.

281
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,140
-- And that's
-- ok.

282
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:57,369
So

283
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:57,869
we're making

284
00:11:57,979 --> 00:11:58,880
a decision

285
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,849
but you shouldn't be expected to be working flawlessly with a piece

286
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:06,469
of hardware or even an application that comes out next year.

287
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,750
So Microsoft is going to disable everything but

288
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,950
TLS 1.2 and up and say Microsoft edge browser

289
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,849
and everybody's going to lose their mind because they can no longer talk to their,

290
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:18,770
talk to their crappy little soho devices to, you know,

291
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,070
configure them through the web interface.

292
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,400
I'm ok with that.

293
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:22,609
Well,

294
00:12:22,729 --> 00:12:25,969
but Microsoft support doesn't want to have to, you know,

295
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:28,010
hire 10 million more people

296
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,010
to explain this to these customers.

297
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,619
-- You know, like that doesn't work
-- that way though.

298
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:34,250
I mean, to call Microsoft support, you need a support agreement.

299
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,919
-- I mean, you can't just
-- call them people would be outraged.

300
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,750
-- I
-- I'm ok with that though, like,

301
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:42,229
but the thing is, are we doing more harm than good?

302
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:44,429
Because for example, yeah, don't get me wrong.

303
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,140
There would be a huge benefit to being like,

304
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,489
you know, what next Thursday

305
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,549
all everything will be TLS 1.2 or newer,

306
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,409
like that would like so many problems would just go away.

307
00:12:57,179 --> 00:12:57,690
Right.

308
00:12:57,989 --> 00:12:59,140
It would be wonderful

309
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,969
on the flip side

310
00:13:01,309 --> 00:13:05,179
that does do economic damage in the sense of like

311
00:13:05,489 --> 00:13:08,099
all these old soho routers and all these old

312
00:13:08,109 --> 00:13:10,739
applications and stuff that can't talk these newer protocols.

313
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,179
-- What happens to them?
-- I'm, they're gonna have to die. Look, man.

314
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,820
I mean, we switched to

315
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,299
digital television

316
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,590
and, and people own devices that don't work anymore and, and there's,

317
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,960
you get a $50 digital TV converter

318
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,719
and you know what, I'm sure

319
00:13:25,849 --> 00:13:29,969
someone could write an app that could be like a crappy insecure proxy or something.

320
00:13:29,979 --> 00:13:30,219
Like

321
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:31,950
there are ways you can make

322
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:34,034
this general,

323
00:13:35,325 --> 00:13:38,684
well, like with a soho device though, I can't run custom code on it easily,

324
00:13:38,695 --> 00:13:40,765
sort of like reloading it with a WDR.

325
00:13:40,974 --> 00:13:40,994
You

326
00:13:41,315 --> 00:13:44,984
could run like a cram proxy on your local system that

327
00:13:44,994 --> 00:13:47,914
would let you connect to it if you absolutely needed to.

328
00:13:47,924 --> 00:13:48,364
Right.

329
00:13:49,219 --> 00:13:50,880
But you're assuming these people running these

330
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,049
systems even have somebody capable of.

331
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:53,359
No, they

332
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:56,469
don't. And that's the whole reason these things should be like

333
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:00,169
and thrown away because these people are, you know, I hate to say it, but

334
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,929
they're a danger to society like they don't even know it.

335
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,130
I was just uh so I was upgrading my cable modem today because the old one is, well,

336
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,849
I realized it was probably four or five years old.

337
00:14:09,859 --> 00:14:12,000
Had been running nonstop, you know, for half a decade

338
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:14,210
and it was starting to draw my internet connection for like,

339
00:14:14,219 --> 00:14:16,919
one or two seconds every couple of hours, which gets really annoying.

340
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,419
And, um, I went and swapped it and while I was there, I actually asked, like,

341
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:22,280
what's the oldest thing you've seen come in?

342
00:14:22,289 --> 00:14:25,130
And she's like, well, actually today we had one of the old silver PV RS and I'm like,

343
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:25,390
the what?

344
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:25,890
Nails?

345
00:14:25,989 --> 00:14:29,159
She's like one of the, you know, and she just, I'm like, oh my God, I remember those,

346
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:30,820
like, from

347
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,369
1015 years ago,

348
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:34,400
you know, and that's the thing, right?

349
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:36,609
Like, there's the thing to remember now is it's not

350
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:40,400
computer systems aren't like a server running, you know,

351
00:14:40,609 --> 00:14:41,919
data center somewhere.

352
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:45,640
It's, it's people like my accountant with a Dell machine

353
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,479
doing God knows what, I don't want to know. I just try not to think about it.

354
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:50,419
They do backups of it.

355
00:14:50,609 --> 00:14:51,559
I checked on that.

356
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,469
But, you know, there's so much, like there's

357
00:14:54,729 --> 00:14:59,409
so much stuff in people's houses, you know, uh PV RS and digital TV.

358
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:01,770
S whatsits that talk to the internet, you know,

359
00:15:02,229 --> 00:15:04,369
uh, all these things and, you know,

360
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:06,250
replacing all this stuff does.

361
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,340
Actually, I mean,

362
00:15:07,349 --> 00:15:11,250
it's tens of hundreds of millions of dollars to get rid of all this stuff.

363
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,280
Um,

364
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,210
part of me is like, yeah, that would be awesome.

365
00:15:14,219 --> 00:15:16,929
I would love to have a rule that says, like, any electronics more than five years old.

366
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,280
You got to take them out back and shoot them

367
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:20,039
in some respects.

368
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:22,659
That wouldn't, I think, be a terrible thing now, ecologically,

369
00:15:22,669 --> 00:15:23,520
it would be terrible.

370
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:24,700
I accept that.

371
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:25,599
But,

372
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,969
you know, like we just can't

373
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:30,150
force everybody to recycle

374
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,190
everything. You know.

375
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:36,419
How old is TLS? 12. Now, it's more than five years old. Right. There's,

376
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:40,679
this is lazy manufacturers that aren't supporting TLS 1.2.

377
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,409
Well, but no, no, the manufacturers don't write implementations.

378
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:46,559
At least I hope they don't, I hope they're using Open SSL because,

379
00:15:46,705 --> 00:15:49,625
oh my God, if I found a vendor apart from like, say, you know,

380
00:15:49,734 --> 00:15:52,385
like a Microsoft or an Apple or a, you know, like

381
00:15:52,674 --> 00:15:52,994
the major

382
00:15:53,755 --> 00:15:54,614
open SSL,

383
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,594
but I'm saying they probably cherry picked some

384
00:15:56,604 --> 00:15:59,325
like 10 year old version five years ago,

385
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:00,085
you know what I mean?

386
00:16:00,094 --> 00:16:02,905
So they were already running something that was too freaking old

387
00:16:02,914 --> 00:16:05,205
and they were too lazy to make it work correctly,

388
00:16:05,614 --> 00:16:06,765
you know, with the newer version.

389
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:13,159
Yeah, TLS 1.2 was defined in RFC 5246 in August of 2008.

390
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:16,169
Part of it to remember.

391
00:16:16,369 --> 00:16:19,530
It's not like people just, oh, you know, you have a new encryption thing,

392
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:20,719
let's just hop on that, right.

393
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,969
You want to kind of make sure it's maybe not fatally flawed. Like, oh,

394
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,320
all the other old stuff.

395
00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:28,950
See, that's the thing to remember too with this concretion, right? Is

396
00:16:29,369 --> 00:16:32,440
Oh, all the old stuff is horribly broken. This new stuff. Totally fine.

397
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,500
It'll be fine forever except, you know, a year from now when we find out the

398
00:16:35,609 --> 00:16:38,619
-- s 1.2 is horribly flawed.
-- What people used to think.

399
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,729
I, I dare say, but I don't think that's the case anymore.

400
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:44,270
I think we've come to recognize the fact that all of

401
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,719
these protocols are fatally flawed and we have to march forward

402
00:16:47,979 --> 00:16:50,059
and this is really the whole reason we're seeing

403
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,969
this decision from Debian in the first place.

404
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:52,320
Right.

405
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:53,559
Well,

406
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,940
see the thing is Debian can make that

407
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:59,150
decision without incurring a significant cost to themselves.

408
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,039
Right. They don't have to worry about selling

409
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,429
systems.

410
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,430
They don't have to like, they don't have some of the concerns Microsoft has.

411
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,040
I mean, again, to be clear, I'm not arguing against this.

412
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,848
I'm just saying there are some significant costs around

413
00:17:12,858 --> 00:17:14,858
making these decisions and it's a trade off.

414
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,800
It's not just simply like kill all the old stuff. Great.

415
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,520
I mean, I'm currently in the process of an IT renewal,

416
00:17:21,729 --> 00:17:24,989
you know, in the last two weeks, I've got a new cable modem, a new Wi Fi because

417
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:27,670
I now have Wi Fi covering my entire desk.

418
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:31,150
Uh, two weeks ago, Wi Fi wasn't available on the left side of my desk,

419
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,510
but it kind of worked mostly on the right side of my desk.

420
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,430
I think it's part of the problem is all the

421
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:38,719
vents and stuff between me and the Wi Fi router.

422
00:17:38,729 --> 00:17:41,699
But now I got one of those scary looking Asus things with like

423
00:17:41,949 --> 00:17:44,260
too many antennas and it seems to work finite.

424
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:47,260
So, here's the thing to remember too.

425
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,290
This isn't like Debbie and is flipping a switch tomorrow. This isn't

426
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:50,939
true.

427
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:52,150
And, and the new,

428
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,510
the version of Debbie and stable just came out like

429
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,099
a month ago or a couple of months ago,

430
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,119
it's very new.

431
00:17:58,589 --> 00:18:00,150
-- And so it's going to
-- be, can they

432
00:18:00,349 --> 00:18:02,560
deprecated and stable though? Can they upgrade their?

433
00:18:02,829 --> 00:18:02,900
I

434
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:06,180
-- don't think
-- they, because they don't have like an API or a B I guarantee do they?

435
00:18:06,189 --> 00:18:08,319
I mean, I'm sure they technically could, but I'm saying they make

436
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:08,939
an effort,

437
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,400
but

438
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:14,239
my suspicion is they'll just wait and they'll, they'll let the current stable,

439
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,949
you know, just kind of phase out and, and the new version won't support it correctly.

440
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:19,290
And I, again,

441
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:23,780
I am perfectly ok with like crappy gear people have in their houses not working.

442
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,979
I, I am very pleased to say that it is going to happen.

443
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,400
Uh Sorry, I'm just reading this. So uh

444
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:31,839
as of July 2017.

445
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:34,219
So for our viewers or listeners,

446
00:18:34,229 --> 00:18:37,800
uh we're currently just in August of 2017 right now as we speak

447
00:18:38,699 --> 00:18:42,500
TLS, 1.3 is a working draft and details are provisional and incomplete.

448
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,839
So we're now at like

449
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,560
10 years between releases of TLS.

450
00:18:47,229 --> 00:18:48,479
It's, it's been a long time

451
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,680
and 1.3 was expected earlier in the year.

452
00:18:51,689 --> 00:18:55,520
But it sounds like there's some hooey going on with some of the reviewers.

453
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,689
-- So I don't know if we're
-- going to see, are they trying to show?

454
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,219
Because I know the financial industry,

455
00:19:00,229 --> 00:19:03,920
a lot of it was not happy about like perfect forward secrecy being the default

456
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,400
-- because it means they can no longer sniff connection.
-- That's part of it.

457
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,849
And, and that's kind of one of the big ones.

458
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,180
And again, this is, this is one of those situations where I think

459
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,430
it is, it is imperative

460
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,310
that

461
00:19:16,439 --> 00:19:18,180
especially security people,

462
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:21,170
we march forward with progress instead of trying to hold something

463
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,310
back because we're just going to end up breaking it.

464
00:19:23,849 --> 00:19:24,400
I agree.

465
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,079
I mean, I personally, I think basically, and I've tweeted this before,

466
00:19:27,089 --> 00:19:27,510
if you're like,

467
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,619
security profile depends on you behaving like

468
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:32,180
a nation state actor that is like intercepting

469
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,930
uh encrypted communications and like,

470
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,630
you know, looking at them,

471
00:19:36,939 --> 00:19:41,199
uh basically all, pretty much all the other vendors are, you know,

472
00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:43,520
working against that they're trying to prevent this stuff.

473
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:48,219
Um But more to the point, I mean, the problem though is you have the, well,

474
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,599
you have this ecosystem, right?

475
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:49,959
So

476
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,280
for example,

477
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,530
I know that there are specific pieces of legislation in various

478
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,119
parts of the world that say as a financial institution,

479
00:19:57,369 --> 00:19:59,550
you have to have visibility into all

480
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,459
the network traffic going across your networks,

481
00:20:01,469 --> 00:20:02,140
which means

482
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:05,160
you know, some schmuck with a mobile phone using your wi fi,

483
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,589
you have to be able to sniff that

484
00:20:08,189 --> 00:20:10,150
-- and you
-- can't really do.

485
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,260
No.

486
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:14,540
But you, I mean, the problem is, you know, when the auditors come in,

487
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,900
you have to make a best effort, which means you have to do this stuff.

488
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:17,130
And,

489
00:20:17,739 --> 00:20:20,300
I mean, that's, that's the part that really gets me is that

490
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,949
now we're talking about things like legislation which is going to take 5,

491
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:25,550
1020 years to change

492
00:20:26,189 --> 00:20:26,680
if,

493
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:27,760
if that

494
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:28,920
maybe longer.

495
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,020
Yeah, assuming it can be changed.

496
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:34,310
Plus you've got multiple jurisdictions and, you know, even within like the US,

497
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:35,050
for example, I mean,

498
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,160
how many different pieces of security and privacy legislation? Are there?

499
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,310
-- Probably not enough? Like,
-- I know there's hi

500
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,439
a and socks and like there's a, there's

501
00:20:45,699 --> 00:20:45,709
a

502
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:47,569
and, and

503
00:20:49,099 --> 00:20:51,410
so I, I want to talk,

504
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,099
there was

505
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,780
a, a link that someone sent me on Twitter

506
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,339
about

507
00:20:58,489 --> 00:20:58,510
it.

508
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,219
It was after the last episode because we were talking about some safety things and,

509
00:21:02,229 --> 00:21:03,770
and I've forgotten the lady's name.

510
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,780
I will put the, the link in the show notes,

511
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,290
but she gave this talk at the o'reilly Security Conference.

512
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,180
I think it was last year or the year before.

513
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:12,219
And

514
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:16,459
basically she pointed out that regulating the auto industry

515
00:21:16,739 --> 00:21:22,939
took nearly 100 years from the time kind of automobiles began until it, it became

516
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:25,780
a legitimate concern of people.

517
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,959
And, and in that case people were literally dying.

518
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,270
I mean, this wasn't being

519
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,800
horribly. Right. Right. And in fact they said that

520
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:34,239
today

521
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:38,209
the number of auto deaths is down substantially from what it used to be.

522
00:21:38,219 --> 00:21:42,349
Even though there are way more vehicles on the road. Just because

523
00:21:42,489 --> 00:21:42,520
in

524
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,000
most of the western world,

525
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,189
in

526
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,319
some other parts of the world it's still pretty terrible.

527
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:51,880
And, and so this is something I think about for security a lot is,

528
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:52,640
yeah, the,

529
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:56,959
the regulations are terrible and the compliance is awful and some of it

530
00:21:56,969 --> 00:21:59,920
doesn't work and a lot of it could even be considered dangerous.

531
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,589
Like what the guy who created the n

532
00:22:01,709 --> 00:22:06,520
password guidelines said last week, like that was the worst mistake I ever made.

533
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:09,199
-- Right.
-- Well, it was a good idea at the time though. Right?

534
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,199
I thought it was true.

535
00:22:10,209 --> 00:22:11,359
Exactly. I thought it was,

536
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:16,160
I remember talking with a Netscape guy. This is like, oh Lord, probably 15 years ago

537
00:22:16,349 --> 00:22:17,199
and I'd written

538
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:21,859
uh Doug song. Who? Wow, that's a name I haven't heard in a while anyways.

539
00:22:21,869 --> 00:22:23,579
He wrote uh Ssh Sniff, remember

540
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:25,880
and as a cell sniff

541
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:31,660
and it was things to do, you know, man, in the middle proxy of SSH and SSL, which I mean,

542
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:33,500
1520 years ago was a big deal.

543
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,020
And uh so I wrote this article talking about, you know, is this the end of SL and

544
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:40,209
H I mean, obviously not, but hyperbole does get clicks

545
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:43,420
and you know this Netscape engineer was like, yeah,

546
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:47,650
if we'd had any idea what SSL would end up being used for.

547
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,939
-- Holy cow, we would have done it very differently, but
-- that's always the case.

548
00:22:51,229 --> 00:22:53,510
All right, just to, just to call it out correctly.

549
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,880
Uh A guy named Fernando Montenegro. I apologize if I buttered your name.

550
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:58,479
And the,

551
00:22:58,489 --> 00:23:03,160
the talk is by someone named Becky Base and I will be sure to put a link to all this in,

552
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:03,780
in the show notes.

553
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:07,119
But I, I would highly recommend everybody watch this because it was,

554
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,209
it, it's, it's hair raising

555
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,010
for

556
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,609
how it all works out and how horrible it is.

557
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:16,430
And I suspect, you know, we're, we're in the same boat because part of it too is,

558
00:23:16,439 --> 00:23:17,750
I mean, the auto industry, at least

559
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:20,489
the cars have four wheels. Right. I mean,

560
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:23,750
my computer now fits in my pocket.

561
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:28,280
-- It doesn't have a keyboard, it's just got a glass screen.
-- It can't murder you yet.

562
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:29,119
Uh,

563
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:30,390
actually,

564
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:31,719
uh,

565
00:23:33,439 --> 00:23:35,479
GPS driving navigation. It could,

566
00:23:36,469 --> 00:23:37,959
you know, if I wasn't really paying attention to

567
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:39,780
the computer

568
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:40,829
and people do it and

569
00:23:42,849 --> 00:23:47,300
-- stuff is,
-- is much different than, than someone hacking your gps.

570
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:48,010
Uh,

571
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,180
not having 911 service when I need

572
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:50,810
-- it.
-- I

573
00:23:51,109 --> 00:23:52,310
won't disagree with you.

574
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:52,569
There,

575
00:23:52,579 --> 00:23:55,969
there are certain things that could be done that would be terribly inconvenient.

576
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:57,489
But, but

577
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,540
yeah, but it's not going to, like, turn on.

578
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,260
Well, it's not like a car wash where it's going, like,

579
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,540
smush me with the arm or whatever.

580
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,060
Right.

581
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:05,949
Yeah.

582
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:09,790
As it turns out if you have heavy machinery controlled by poorly secured computers,

583
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,989
you're gonna have a bad time.

584
00:24:11,459 --> 00:24:14,989
That's the thing. Right. Those are the things that are probably going to see

585
00:24:15,349 --> 00:24:18,359
the most regulation and laws because people can,

586
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,790
people can understand what that means.

587
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,369
People don't understand what it means when they hack your gps on your iphone,

588
00:24:24,619 --> 00:24:25,069
you know.

589
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:26,150
Right.

590
00:24:26,469 --> 00:24:28,359
Well, there's been cases where people went.

591
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:30,560
Um, oh, what was that tragic case where the guy,

592
00:24:30,849 --> 00:24:33,880
the gps basically showed a shortcut between two major roads

593
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,770
and it was like a logging path or something.

594
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,109
And they went out there in winter

595
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,310
and got their car stuck and the guy went for help and died and,

596
00:24:41,469 --> 00:24:44,560
-- and it was like a tech guy. I remember it was some famous tech
-- guy.

597
00:24:44,569 --> 00:24:47,989
It was a couple of years ago. I do remember that and, and his

598
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,839
-- kids stayed in the car and they did, which
-- is

599
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,689
absolutely what you're supposed to do.

600
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:53,829
Um,

601
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:58,339
but yeah, I mean, so no to say that, I mean, yeah, granted my phone can't like,

602
00:24:58,349 --> 00:25:01,260
you know, cut me or like, explode in my hands.

603
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:01,880
But

604
00:25:02,229 --> 00:25:05,839
no, you could, if I wasn't paying attention, you could definitely, you know,

605
00:25:05,949 --> 00:25:07,829
-- ok,
-- but, but here's the thing is

606
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:11,219
what you're describing is extraordinary events.

607
00:25:11,229 --> 00:25:15,430
Whereas back in the day, if you got in a car accident, you died. Right.

608
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,050
On your question.

609
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,989
-- You know, you got impaled.
-- Right.

610
00:25:18,339 --> 00:25:22,729
It's, uh, did you ever see that video? It's, uh, it's on youtube. It's a Chevy Malibu.

611
00:25:22,739 --> 00:25:24,489
Like an old one. I think it's a Chevy Malibu.

612
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,040
It's, anyways, it's like a 19 fifties car and then the modern version of it and they,

613
00:25:28,209 --> 00:25:30,229
they crashed them head on offset and it's

614
00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:35,300
-- horrifying.
-- It's crazy. Uh, it was, it impala, I forget who it

615
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:35,599
was.

616
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:36,699
-- Something like that. Yes.
-- Yes.

617
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:39,449
They took kind of the old and it was a car from when, like,

618
00:25:39,459 --> 00:25:42,349
the N TSB was created versus a car today.

619
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,770
And actually I remember watching that because back

620
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,959
in the day people were always like,

621
00:25:46,969 --> 00:25:48,719
oh, these old cars were all steeled.

622
00:25:48,729 --> 00:25:50,420
They're much safer than the new cars.

623
00:25:50,469 --> 00:25:52,979
And I remember I watched it, I thought, nope, those,

624
00:25:52,989 --> 00:25:55,979
those old cars are not much safer than the new car.

625
00:25:55,989 --> 00:25:56,969
They're much less.

626
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:58,890
It was a Chevrolet Bel Air

627
00:25:59,069 --> 00:25:59,439
versus

628
00:25:59,540 --> 00:25:59,589
a, a

629
00:26:00,069 --> 00:26:01,910
2009. Chevrolet Malibu.

630
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:07,699
Yeah. Yeah. Well, it was an offset crash too, wasn't it? Which is like way worse?

631
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:11,780
Yeah. But I mean, in a modern, well, the modern car did pretty. Ok.

632
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,619
He said, I remember reading the story,

633
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:16,479
the person in the old car would have died instantly and

634
00:26:16,489 --> 00:26:19,000
the person in the other car probably would have walked away.

635
00:26:19,739 --> 00:26:20,000
Yeah,

636
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,979
that's crazy.

637
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,640
Well, it's, you know, we've learned a lot about how to make cars safer

638
00:26:24,479 --> 00:26:27,770
-- and
-- unfortunately we, we learned it because lots of people died,

639
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,020
right? Do you want to hear something incredibly stupid or

640
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,500
up until about 20 years ago in Canada, in horse riding circles,

641
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,140
it wasn't actually required to wear your chin strap on your helmet.

642
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,469
Then why even wear a helmet?

643
00:26:40,209 --> 00:26:40,770
Good question,

644
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:41,150
obviously

645
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:42,160
-- gonna fall,
-- right.

646
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,219
And here's the worst part,

647
00:26:43,229 --> 00:26:45,699
there was a very famous writer called Ian Miller who

648
00:26:45,709 --> 00:26:47,780
like went to the Olympics and everything hugely famous.

649
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:51,540
He never wears chin strap. And of course, you know, monkey see monkey do.

650
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:55,609
But yeah, I mean, like literally humans, we just,

651
00:26:56,229 --> 00:27:00,150
I I've met people who don't want to wear a seat belt in a car because they think like,

652
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,369
because it's never going to happen to me, Kurt

653
00:27:02,719 --> 00:27:05,560
-- or
-- because they're like, what if the car catches fire and I need to escape?

654
00:27:05,569 --> 00:27:06,109
And I'm like,

655
00:27:06,699 --> 00:27:08,300
yeah, it's, I mean,

656
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:11,599
it's statistically really unlikely like for

657
00:27:11,609 --> 00:27:13,170
that specific scenario to happen where

658
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,300
-- you end up better off because you're not wearing your seat
-- bet.

659
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:18,689
So if you're one of those people and, and I'm totally serious,

660
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,550
uh you, you can buy these like special seatbelt knives you can put in your car,

661
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,829
like just give one and duct tape the thing to the freaking seatbelt, right?

662
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:26,250
Like that.

663
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:28,869
-- And
-- they also usually have like the little glass smasher so that

664
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,699
if you do manage to drive into a river or whatever,

665
00:27:30,709 --> 00:27:32,790
-- you can smash the glass and get up and
-- and let's face it,

666
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,780
the vast majority of those people,

667
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:38,660
they just don't want to wear their seatbelt. Right. That's what it really is.

668
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:41,130
-- And they've made up some bizarre excuse
-- that people just

669
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:41,300
don't

670
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:42,390
confirm narrative.

671
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,270
Right.

672
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,469
Seriously. Who, what, like,

673
00:27:47,329 --> 00:27:49,599
how many, how many groups can we offend today? Let's

674
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,930
-- probably all of them if we try. I'm sure
-- we can. I'm sure we can anyway.

675
00:27:53,969 --> 00:27:58,390
Anyway, the point being we started with Debbie and, and we're ending with cars.

676
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,500
And it's really about the fact that I think

677
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,219
it is important to understand where the forward

678
00:28:04,229 --> 00:28:06,300
march of progress is going to take you.

679
00:28:06,449 --> 00:28:07,180
However,

680
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:10,859
the history of humanity says nobody is going to come along nicely.

681
00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:12,219
-- We are going to be
-- dragged.

682
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,010
-- You can offer them some massive benefit, like,
-- even with massive benefit,

683
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,300
Kurt to get, get like auto regulations.

684
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:20,979
It was kicking and screaming the hallway,

685
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,209
right.

686
00:28:22,589 --> 00:28:26,510
And, and even people were like, oh, I don't want to pay more for a car that, you know,

687
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,459
might save my life.

688
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:32,660
This is what it's going to be, is, is we are going to have to drag humanity

689
00:28:32,829 --> 00:28:35,739
because I had this discussion with an older person where they're like, oh, old cars.

690
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,609
Yeah, they, when you're smashed up you could just fix the car.

691
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:40,390
And I'm like, I'm like, we don't actually want that. And she's like, what do you mean?

692
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:40,949
And I'm like,

693
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,489
how much does it cost to even just completely replace a car,

694
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,719
if it gets destroyed in a car accident.

695
00:28:45,729 --> 00:28:48,140
Right. You're looking at 30 40 50 grand tops.

696
00:28:48,709 --> 00:28:52,880
How much does one or two days in the IC U cost if you're in a bad car wreck?

697
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:55,060
Uh, I assume more than that.

698
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:59,569
Yeah, a lot more. Plus, say 10 years of physio for a messed up neck.

699
00:29:00,109 --> 00:29:01,250
I totally agree.

700
00:29:01,689 --> 00:29:03,160
And that's part of the problem is, you know,

701
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:05,300
we also need to look at like the bigger picture.

702
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:05,829
So like,

703
00:29:06,099 --> 00:29:09,099
I'm just not convinced that because let's be honest, right? Most

704
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:12,150
very few Attackers attack the encryption

705
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:13,689
because

706
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:16,790
you can just hack the website and like suck down the the

707
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,969
the payments file or whatever,

708
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,369
you know.

709
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,359
And so that's one of, that's one basically,

710
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:24,219
that's the only reason I'm not sure that we'd be

711
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:28,180
-- that we should be aggressively sunsetting cryptography protocols
-- because no,

712
00:29:28,189 --> 00:29:28,670
OK.

713
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,579
No, no, you, you've made a serious mistake in your assumption.

714
00:29:31,969 --> 00:29:35,209
So TLS has been attacked successfully

715
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:37,160
many times over the years.

716
00:29:37,469 --> 00:29:40,739
The encryption behind the TLS has never fallen.

717
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:43,910
It's always implementation problems that are attacked,

718
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:49,189
right? And, and so we, we've reached a point where like if you're running, say SSL two

719
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:53,199
people could literally man in the middle of you in real time with SSL.

720
00:29:53,439 --> 00:29:57,829
I agree with something as old as SSL two. But for example, TLS 1.0 and 1.1

721
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,670
you know, nation states definitely are attacking this.

722
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,900
We've, we've seen evidence of that.

723
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:06,630
I'm certain of that and, and I think they have enough problems

724
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:08,739
and not only that, here's the bigger reason

725
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:13,780
is modern compliance says no TLS 10 or 11.

726
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,979
And so just turning it off is going to make that much, much easier to deal with as well.

727
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:19,270
Yeah,

728
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,229
I don't know. I'm comfortable with it, man.

729
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:24,550
I, I think we should, we should deprecate this old crap faster than we do.

730
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:28,189
I, well, I mean, in general,

731
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:30,790
if we build systems that could be upgraded more

732
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,849
-- easily with less hassle and
-- that's the thing,

733
00:30:33,859 --> 00:30:35,489
-- right, then
-- we would just be better off.

734
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,650
That will be the inevitable outcome of, of things like this.

735
00:30:39,739 --> 00:30:42,089
If, if people can't run something forever,

736
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,109
they're going to at least the manufacturers hopefully will start to think about how

737
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:49,650
can I make sure this is something people will still be wanting to use?

738
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,270
Although they,

739
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,170
they probably don't have an incentive to keep something alive for 10 years.

740
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:53,420
But

741
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,989
you get the idea right is,

742
00:30:55,589 --> 00:30:59,040
oh, I've decided now I'm, I'm going to replace all my networking gear basically.

743
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:02,099
-- Every 3 to 4 years.
-- Mine like cooks itself every couple of years. So

744
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:02,599
that's

745
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,510
like I said, my,

746
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:06,949
my Wi Fi range was slowly starting to decrease in the house.

747
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:08,050
-- So
-- what it

748
00:31:08,439 --> 00:31:11,400
is, what it is, in fact, my router funny enough, uh

749
00:31:11,699 --> 00:31:13,439
I, I bought an Asus router

750
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,479
and

751
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:15,400
it died.

752
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:18,619
And so like it was one of those like I, I needed internet that day.

753
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:22,040
So I literally drove to Best Buy that minute, bought a new router, drove back home,

754
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:22,800
plugged it in

755
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,810
and then I, I looked it up and my old router was still under warranty.

756
00:31:25,819 --> 00:31:27,760
So I sent it back and they sent me a new one.

757
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,640
And now the last one I bought just died like two weeks ago.

758
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:33,380
And I plugged in the old one, the old R MA router,

759
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:36,280
but unfortunately the other one was out of warranty.

760
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,540
So I thought it would have been hilarious if I

761
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,900
just continued some sort of bizarre warranty ping pong.

762
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,790
But, yeah, no, I, I get it.

763
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,130
And so now I keep thinking, I'm like,

764
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:47,280
I should buy a new router because I know this one is gonna die.

765
00:31:48,099 --> 00:31:48,319
Yeah.

766
00:31:48,329 --> 00:31:50,810
But you can get like, I mean, I got a top, well,

767
00:31:50,819 --> 00:31:53,030
not a top line but a pretty high end ASIS one.

768
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,959
I mean, Amazon Prime will have that to you in a day or two.

769
00:31:55,969 --> 00:31:58,869
And if you absolutely have to go to Best Buy, to pick it up,

770
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,869
-- you can be there and back in a few hours
-- unwilling to wait a day for a

771
00:32:02,979 --> 00:32:03,119
new R,

772
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,520
like I need my internet now.

773
00:32:05,969 --> 00:32:06,170
Well, see,

774
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,890
this is why I have two network connections at home

775
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,640
because it also forces me then to have like the,

776
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,979
I have actually two firewalls instead of a single firewall.

777
00:32:12,989 --> 00:32:15,239
But if your Wi Fi dies what are you going to do?

778
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,689
Uh, swap in an old wi

779
00:32:16,829 --> 00:32:17,599
fi access point?

780
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:20,079
-- Actually,
-- I do have another old one in the closet.

781
00:32:20,089 --> 00:32:20,479
Really?

782
00:32:20,489 --> 00:32:22,359
I have little like cockroaches, man.

783
00:32:22,369 --> 00:32:26,199
They just, they, they get sick but they don't die. And so, like,

784
00:32:26,449 --> 00:32:26,869
uh,

785
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:30,439
yeah, I guess that's true. The old one I have, I, it does technically work.

786
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:33,359
It's in a box. I'm gonna get rid of it. But anyway, anyway,

787
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:36,760
uh, we should talk about HBO perhaps,

788
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:39,930
which is not at all open source related but,

789
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,030
but why not?

790
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:44,339
Yeah, I mean, so, yeah.

791
00:32:44,349 --> 00:32:45,119
Well, and I mean,

792
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:48,170
my feelings on HBO are somewhat conflicted because quite frankly

793
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,550
for me to get HBO legally where I live,

794
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,119
I'm looking at like, quite a lot of money.

795
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:56,209
I'm, I'm pleased to say that it is not a problem I suffer from.

796
00:32:56,430 --> 00:33:00,359
I, I have HBO now, which is like $15 a month and it's fantastic.

797
00:33:00,369 --> 00:33:02,010
I used to watch Game of Thrones which we

798
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,959
will not give out any game of Thrones spoilers,

799
00:33:04,329 --> 00:33:04,680
but

800
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,430
I don't watch that show. So, you don't watch Game of Thrones?

801
00:33:08,579 --> 00:33:09,520
I saw the first

802
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,010
dude. It's

803
00:33:10,209 --> 00:33:10,239
good.

804
00:33:10,849 --> 00:33:10,880
I

805
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:11,170
think

806
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:13,430
I just kind of lost interest

807
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,060
you should watch. Actually, the first season is a little weird.

808
00:33:16,069 --> 00:33:20,099
-- I won't lie, but it gets, it gets solid. I really like it, it
-- was a lack of weird.

809
00:33:20,109 --> 00:33:20,920
It wasn't weird.

810
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:25,050
I mean, it was just, I just didn't really, I don't know, fantasies, just

811
00:33:25,229 --> 00:33:26,060
whatever

812
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:26,589
you,

813
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:29,099
I'm, I'm comfortable saying you're wrong.

814
00:33:29,369 --> 00:33:31,489
So, anyway, anyway,

815
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,020
here's the important thing though is for those of you who don't know

816
00:33:34,369 --> 00:33:37,400
HBO got hacked and I guess some of the scripts and,

817
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,449
-- and videos of Game of Thrones apparently
-- also

818
00:33:39,459 --> 00:33:41,150
phone numbers of the actors and well see,

819
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:42,930
phone numbers of the actors is unfortunate,

820
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:44,939
although I imagine finding these people's phone numbers

821
00:33:44,949 --> 00:33:47,319
isn't an insurmountable task if you're clever.

822
00:33:47,329 --> 00:33:49,359
But, but the point being bad guys got it

823
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,079
and now they're trying to ransom it away

824
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:53,199
and, and I do feel like,

825
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:56,329
-- sorry, that's just so stupid.
-- It kind of is

826
00:33:56,489 --> 00:33:59,160
who's gonna like, pay for a script or pay. Like,

827
00:33:59,969 --> 00:34:00,010
I

828
00:34:00,369 --> 00:34:02,569
feel like, like for all the, like, for example,

829
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:05,209
I really enjoy watching Black Mirror and if you offered me like all

830
00:34:05,219 --> 00:34:07,390
the scripts for Black Mirror going forward for the next 10 years,

831
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:07,810
I'd be like, yeah.

832
00:34:07,819 --> 00:34:09,320
No, thanks because quite frankly

833
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:12,679
I, yeah, I could read the scripts and I'm sure they'd be kind of interesting but

834
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,469
you know, they're scripts, they don't work as like reading material.

835
00:34:16,478 --> 00:34:19,290
What about the video though? Imagine the videos because I,

836
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:22,120
the scripts are much less interesting than the actual video

837
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:24,438
I might watch maybe. But I mean,

838
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:27,168
here's, here's my more to the point I wouldn't,

839
00:34:27,428 --> 00:34:30,759
I don't feel like HBO is gonna pay like a ransom to get,

840
00:34:30,908 --> 00:34:33,618
I think they're lunatics if they do. And well, this happened in Netflix.

841
00:34:33,628 --> 00:34:35,489
With orange is the new black and,

842
00:34:35,498 --> 00:34:39,289
and this is where I kind of have a very open source viewpoint of,

843
00:34:39,299 --> 00:34:41,947
-- of this problem is release,
-- early release

844
00:34:42,339 --> 00:34:43,849
once the episode airs,

845
00:34:44,069 --> 00:34:45,398
like it doesn't matter anymore.

846
00:34:45,408 --> 00:34:48,039
You know, it's kind of like, I remember the old joke about

847
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:50,998
uh uh it was, I think the Apache guys,

848
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:51,849
I

849
00:34:52,118 --> 00:34:54,138
don't think it happens like it used to but they used to

850
00:34:54,148 --> 00:34:56,708
get an email about once a week where someone was like,

851
00:34:56,717 --> 00:35:00,428
do you guys know your, your source code is leaked on this FTP site?

852
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:00,809
And they're

853
00:35:00,938 --> 00:35:00,968
like,

854
00:35:01,198 --> 00:35:03,708
yeah, yeah, we do. And, and, you know, it's kind of,

855
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:05,539
I feel like it's a bit like that. Right.

856
00:35:05,549 --> 00:35:09,188
It's once the episode airs using the word air and air quotes here

857
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:13,668
like it. Now that information you, you're trying to ransom has no value.

858
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:16,389
Right. Oh, yeah. No, it's very

859
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,429
-- time sensitive but
-- HBO could do. That would be a hilarious finger

860
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:24,550
to, to these people big middle finger sticking up is just like,

861
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,510
release the episode early

862
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,229
just to be like, no,

863
00:35:28,629 --> 00:35:31,620
your ransom has no place here. Right.

864
00:35:31,899 --> 00:35:36,149
-- Yeah.
-- Well, I, I just, I can't imagine because even if you do pay the ransom,

865
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:38,790
it's not like this group is going to be doing

866
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,110
enough ransoms to want to have a good reputation,

867
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,370
you know, like some of those.

868
00:35:42,379 --> 00:35:44,870
And not only that, the way this works is

869
00:35:45,739 --> 00:35:48,739
I've already paid them for the month. Right. I can't,

870
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:52,909
even if I did pirate it, which I'm too lazy to do. I won't lie to you.

871
00:35:52,919 --> 00:35:56,639
Even if I did though, like HBO doesn't make less money. Right.

872
00:35:56,649 --> 00:35:57,389
I'm not gonna be like, oh,

873
00:35:57,399 --> 00:36:00,040
I'm gonna cancel my subscription now that I can pirate early up.

874
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:02,929
-- No, like, screw that. I'm lazy and I want to watch them on my,
-- I

875
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,629
think honestly probably the biggest

876
00:36:05,919 --> 00:36:08,030
negative outcome of this would be somebody

877
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,959
watching it and then posting spoilers on like

878
00:36:09,969 --> 00:36:13,169
a popular Twitter feed or something and kind of ruining it for other people.

879
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:14,409
That's

880
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,709
probably the biggest negative outcome.

881
00:36:16,379 --> 00:36:17,929
Sadly, you're right. And

882
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:18,729
I think

883
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,969
I can live with that.

884
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:20,760
It's

885
00:36:20,989 --> 00:36:21,530
uh, yeah,

886
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,330
anyway,

887
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,860
whatever it's,

888
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:24,810
I, I think

889
00:36:24,969 --> 00:36:26,899
I just part of me really hopes that these

890
00:36:26,909 --> 00:36:28,739
companies don't pay because one of the beauties of,

891
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:29,919
for example, in America,

892
00:36:30,139 --> 00:36:34,590
the FBI has made kidnapping just, it's not financially worth it,

893
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:35,179
right?

894
00:36:35,189 --> 00:36:36,419
I mean, kidnappings happen,

895
00:36:36,429 --> 00:36:38,580
but they're almost never financial in nature because the

896
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,979
FBI made sure to like Nip that in the bud

897
00:36:41,729 --> 00:36:43,580
and then there's other countries where like, you know,

898
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:46,979
being kidnapped for money and all that is like essentially normal,

899
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:47,689
right?

900
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:50,909
You know, I like ransomware is a great example, right?

901
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:54,280
Ransomware has gotten to the point where, yeah, I mean, it's just what? Really?

902
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:57,919
Oh, I don't know if you saw the number for the wanna cry guys. Was it, uh, wanna crypt?

903
00:36:57,929 --> 00:36:58,280
Sorry.

904
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:02,260
Which, which one am I thinking of now the one that did the, um,

905
00:37:02,449 --> 00:37:05,270
the windows XP and whatnot stuff.

906
00:37:05,459 --> 00:37:06,760
-- That's
-- the wanna cry one.

907
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:10,489
Anyways, apparently the total amount of Bitcoin paid to them was like,

908
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,620
somewhere in the neighborhood of just over 100 grand.

909
00:37:12,629 --> 00:37:15,199
-- It's not that much. I mean, it's,
-- it's, oh,

910
00:37:15,389 --> 00:37:18,300
for the amount of ruckus it caused,

911
00:37:18,649 --> 00:37:21,669
it probably cost billions in all the nonsense.

912
00:37:21,699 --> 00:37:24,459
Easily three or four orders of magnitude more than they are

913
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,419
and nothing.

914
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:26,620
Yeah.

915
00:37:26,629 --> 00:37:30,060
And I mean, well, granted, we still have, for example, spam is a great example,

916
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:30,179
right?

917
00:37:30,189 --> 00:37:34,260
Spam is a huge problem and, you know, we spend

918
00:37:34,429 --> 00:37:36,850
billions if not tens of billions of dollars a year

919
00:37:37,139 --> 00:37:37,899
preventing it.

920
00:37:38,129 --> 00:37:38,760
You know,

921
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:40,659
and it just, it's,

922
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:40,929
I

923
00:37:41,139 --> 00:37:44,120
just, I still don't understand how people can fall for spam

924
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:48,379
because humans are terrible at understanding how anything works.

925
00:37:48,389 --> 00:37:50,500
It's like fishing, man, you can fish anybody.

926
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:53,110
It doesn't matter how much training you go. It doesn't matter who they are,

927
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,100
you can fish them

928
00:37:54,389 --> 00:37:55,060
guaranteed

929
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:57,409
you and I are not immune to fishing.

930
00:37:57,689 --> 00:37:59,620
And I'm quite comfortable saying that the answer is

931
00:37:59,629 --> 00:38:00,870
just not to read any of your emails.

932
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:02,889
-- Well, that's why
-- I'm moving to a UB key for everything.

933
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,510
-- Good. That's a very good
-- choice

934
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:06,790
to help prevent myself from making stupid mistakes.

935
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,649
I carry three UI keys with me actually, which is hilarious.

936
00:38:10,229 --> 00:38:12,989
I, you know what I use it for. Actually, I met the UI key guys.

937
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,459
I was talking to him at black hat

938
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:15,399
and I

939
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,050
pulled my G

940
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,540
on, I've got three of them. The guy's like, why do you have three?

941
00:38:18,949 --> 00:38:22,810
And I said, uh I, I use them like HS MS actually, where I carry around,

942
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,919
I've got a whole bunch of, of uh GP G keys on my U key.

943
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:29,969
So essentially what you're saying is somebody needs to kidnap

944
00:38:29,979 --> 00:38:31,570
you and then threaten you with a lead pipe.

945
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,219
-- They
-- can
-- have it.

946
00:38:32,229 --> 00:38:35,929
They could just ask, look, look, if you like, you probably give them up for 100 bucks.

947
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:37,540
I'm not gonna lie to you. Right. Like,

948
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:40,570
and then I go home and I just generate new keys. Like,

949
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:42,129
seriously.

950
00:38:42,419 --> 00:38:43,649
Yeah. Anyway, anyway,

951
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:44,600
uh Right.

952
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,949
I, I think we got this one and, and I guess lastly the,

953
00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:50,520
the one other thing I'd like to talk about is the N PM thing,

954
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:53,060
I guess, sort of typo squatting. NP MP.

955
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:57,969
Well, it's not so much typo squatting as sort of who? Um,

956
00:38:58,449 --> 00:39:01,330
well, part of it is typo squatting for sure, but some of it is also his name.

957
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,209
Space management

958
00:39:03,939 --> 00:39:07,250
is, is NCM is the no Js package manager.

959
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:10,750
So essentially when you, when you have a node project and you,

960
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,889
you need to pull in like dependencies or something.

961
00:39:12,899 --> 00:39:15,290
Uh N PM is the tool of choice to do that.

962
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,260
Yeah.

963
00:39:16,399 --> 00:39:18,949
Right. Just for people who don't know, I'll assume somebody does.

964
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,510
And so, yeah, I mean,

965
00:39:21,919 --> 00:39:23,889
the reality is people do make typos, you know,

966
00:39:23,899 --> 00:39:28,000
import foo and spell it with three Os instead of two Os.

967
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:33,899
I took out what a dash and the, the one I read about it was something, dash something.

968
00:39:33,909 --> 00:39:38,310
-- And he just took the dash out assuming people are going to mistakenly
-- every time I,

969
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,439
I reinstall a computer or something, you know.

970
00:39:40,449 --> 00:39:43,260
And then I put chrome on it and then I have to go find the, um,

971
00:39:43,709 --> 00:39:47,699
the ad blocker I use and it's like, is it you block origin? Is it you block

972
00:39:48,169 --> 00:39:51,909
or like, you know, because there's like six different U block things now trying to,

973
00:39:51,919 --> 00:39:53,219
you know, squat on the name of

974
00:39:53,939 --> 00:39:57,070
forks or, and so I'm always like, you know, like

975
00:39:57,209 --> 00:39:58,959
trying to find a different computer. So they,

976
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,189
well, I guess they all have the same one. I hope it's the right one.

977
00:40:02,459 --> 00:40:03,209
There's really, you know,

978
00:40:03,219 --> 00:40:06,010
because there's not like some central registry where I can check.

979
00:40:06,169 --> 00:40:09,419
Yep. Yep. Yeah, same, same basic idea. However,

980
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:12,340
in your case, they're just selling ads.

981
00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:13,570
In this case,

982
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:18,370
it sounds like the malicious code was stealing credentials from developers.

983
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,929
Which is really interesting because

984
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:25,340
now the natural question, the next question becomes, what are they, are,

985
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:27,090
is this someone just kind of hoarding this

986
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,689
or are they actively attacking the stuff or,

987
00:40:29,699 --> 00:40:31,320
or what's, I guess what's next?

988
00:40:31,939 --> 00:40:34,909
And I haven't heard anything about that but it's, it's interesting.

989
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,330
It could be, I mean, because one of my thoughts on is this,

990
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:42,270
you get that sort of wildfire problem where, you know, for example,

991
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:47,770
if I could hack five or six popular NP MS and get everybody using them to be hacked,

992
00:40:48,419 --> 00:40:51,629
you could probably quickly infest the entire ecosystem

993
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,729
without a doubt.

994
00:40:54,149 --> 00:40:57,520
You know, what was it? The, the guy, the, the right shift with

995
00:40:57,729 --> 00:40:59,989
the seven lines of code left shift. Sorry,

996
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,360
the, what was it? Seven lines of code or

997
00:41:02,659 --> 00:41:05,850
whatever anyways, you know, if that guy had been evil, who

998
00:41:06,929 --> 00:41:10,149
I mean, but that's true of nearly anything.

999
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:10,639
I mean, if,

1000
00:41:10,649 --> 00:41:16,080
if Linus decided to sell out one day or the GCC guys decided or the chrome guys or,

1001
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:19,610
-- you know, there's,
-- well, I mean, I'm less worried about people deciding to sell,

1002
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,719
I'm more worried about, yeah, you know,

1003
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:25,679
somebody somehow goofs their credentials and some, and a bad guy gets into their

1004
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,459
whatever code project.

1005
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:28,800
Um

1006
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,179
I mean, the thing to remember too is like,

1007
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:34,290
Linux has at least a reasonable set of checks and balances.

1008
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,040
There are people doing code reviews but like a lot of these NP MS

1009
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:39,649
-- are probably one developer. They, they
-- probably are.

1010
00:41:39,659 --> 00:41:42,510
And here's the scarier thing is what you're describing

1011
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,399
is almost certainly going to happen someday because there's

1012
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:47,719
checks and balances.

1013
00:41:48,149 --> 00:41:50,620
Remember when Ruby gems.org sort of got hacked

1014
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,909
luckily by a well meaning person who didn't do anything evil. But, you know,

1015
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:55,719
I do,

1016
00:41:55,939 --> 00:41:56,949
they, again,

1017
00:41:56,959 --> 00:41:59,199
that would have been if it had been a bad guy that

1018
00:41:59,209 --> 00:42:02,010
would have been every single person doing ruby development who like,

1019
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,919
didn't read hacker news or whatever for a couple of hours.

1020
00:42:04,979 --> 00:42:05,969
The unknown

1021
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:06,929
is,

1022
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:10,370
this hasn't happened yet. I think it will someday

1023
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,850
and it will be very interesting to see what the reaction ends up being.

1024
00:42:14,659 --> 00:42:18,120
Well, so I know some large organizations, for example, this is why they,

1025
00:42:18,129 --> 00:42:21,899
they have their own in house copies of these things that they basically download,

1026
00:42:21,909 --> 00:42:23,479
stabilize and the news because

1027
00:42:23,729 --> 00:42:26,729
partly because they just want something that works and is stable and boring.

1028
00:42:26,739 --> 00:42:28,250
But also because then they don't have to

1029
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,770
have this external dependency that can be easily

1030
00:42:31,179 --> 00:42:33,100
modified in a malicious way. Right?

1031
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:36,399
Well, in, in like I know for example, sun type does this as,

1032
00:42:36,409 --> 00:42:39,469
as kind of a business model as does a what is it J frog,

1033
00:42:39,479 --> 00:42:43,229
I think has something called artifact which very similar in in the same respect.

1034
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:43,639
And

1035
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:46,709
I think this is a discussion.

1036
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:47,979
I'm I'm actually in the middle of with

1037
00:42:47,989 --> 00:42:51,340
some other people unrelated to this particular topic.

1038
00:42:51,629 --> 00:42:53,100
But the fact is

1039
00:42:53,429 --> 00:42:55,850
this is a problem when you're working with open source.

1040
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,639
But literally everyone uses open source.

1041
00:42:57,649 --> 00:43:00,489
I mean, anyone who says he answers to quit using open source like, yeah,

1042
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,090
you're in need.

1043
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:03,199
All right, like that's, that's not an answer.

1044
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:03,909
-- I
-- just cannot,

1045
00:43:03,919 --> 00:43:08,709
I would love to watch somebody try and write a modern browser or a modern

1046
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,090
-- crypto implementation or do
-- anything, everything has,

1047
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:14,010
it doesn't matter what it is

1048
00:43:14,456 --> 00:43:15,385
and, and just

1049
00:43:15,716 --> 00:43:18,575
anyone who doesn't realize that is, is out of touch.

1050
00:43:18,585 --> 00:43:19,996
I mean, that, that's the reality of it.

1051
00:43:20,006 --> 00:43:22,345
You, you're using open source, there's nothing you can do about it.

1052
00:43:22,355 --> 00:43:25,365
So, the question now becomes, how do we actually deal with this stuff? And

1053
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:29,865
I, I don't know the answer today. I mean, there's various things that can be done.

1054
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:31,845
None of them are very nice options.

1055
00:43:32,025 --> 00:43:35,075
I think a simple thing goes back to

1056
00:43:35,181 --> 00:43:37,941
and this is something generally speaking that people want anyways is,

1057
00:43:37,951 --> 00:43:40,761
is that sort of agile development

1058
00:43:41,021 --> 00:43:41,622
DEV

1059
00:43:41,842 --> 00:43:46,181
ops, you know, like just code agility in the sense of like, here's the reality

1060
00:43:46,402 --> 00:43:49,201
at some point, your code will have some horrible thing,

1061
00:43:49,211 --> 00:43:53,281
be it security or a denial of service or like whoops, we,

1062
00:43:53,291 --> 00:43:55,922
we put like a really rude word in the source code

1063
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:57,979
and we need to fix it right now

1064
00:43:58,229 --> 00:43:59,889
and ship that fix out to everybody,

1065
00:44:00,469 --> 00:44:01,000
you know,

1066
00:44:01,429 --> 00:44:03,169
and, and like, there's, you know,

1067
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,300
like there's all those infamous cases where like literally a whole

1068
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,129
bunch of different people implemented a specification and they all did it

1069
00:44:09,449 --> 00:44:10,889
the wrong way, you know,

1070
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,409
on a different.

1071
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:15,030
-- So
-- my point is basically is that economically we,

1072
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,540
we have to basically build systems where we can

1073
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:19,649
quickly react to

1074
00:44:19,989 --> 00:44:21,250
things anyways. And

1075
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:24,129
-- that basically solves this problem largely
-- sort of

1076
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:29,330
what you describe I agree with for some other reasons, but not necessarily this one.

1077
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:32,979
If you move slow and you're using an old version of, say a node package,

1078
00:44:32,989 --> 00:44:36,229
you're actually going to be ok when something gets pumped

1079
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:40,530
-- because what's going to happen is
-- except for all the security flaws in the meantime,

1080
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:41,939
that have been fixed in that package

1081
00:44:42,199 --> 00:44:42,820
there is that.

1082
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:46,820
But the question becomes, how long do you think it's going to be from the time?

1083
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:51,139
A bad guy backdoors a major package until it's actually noticed

1084
00:44:51,629 --> 00:44:53,610
by somebody and the word goes out.

1085
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,919
Uh Well, there was that um

1086
00:44:56,659 --> 00:44:57,959
oh, was it on chrome

1087
00:44:59,149 --> 00:45:02,639
where the guys lost their uh chrome?

1088
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,659
Uh what was it? What was it?

1089
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:09,330
Yeah, someone hijacks a popular chrome extension, blah, blah,

1090
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,219
blah Fishers have recently hacked an extension of Google Chrome after

1091
00:45:12,229 --> 00:45:14,899
compromising the Chrome web store account of German developer team,

1092
00:45:14,909 --> 00:45:16,899
a 99 software, blah, blah, blah,

1093
00:45:17,189 --> 00:45:19,689
dubbed Copy Fish, the extension blah, blah, blah,

1094
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:19,820
blah.

1095
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:22,899
And how long did it take before? Somebody figured that out?

1096
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:25,540
I think it was on the order of a day or two.

1097
00:45:25,719 --> 00:45:30,300
And, and my suspicion is it will be less than a week but more than a day.

1098
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,229
And yeah, here we go.

1099
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:37,830
They got hacked on the 28th of July and they pushed out a new version on the 29th of July

1100
00:45:38,189 --> 00:45:40,919
and the new version on the 29th was the bad one.

1101
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:43,060
Well, no, no, no, like they pushed.

1102
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:45,820
Uh so the the bad guys pushed out a new version and then the,

1103
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:48,159
the good guys pushed out a newer version to like,

1104
00:45:48,409 --> 00:45:49,330
you know, get rid of it

1105
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:52,530
-- basically. Yeah.
-- And so

1106
00:45:53,189 --> 00:45:55,530
my suspicion is that's what you're going to see.

1107
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:57,989
And so if you think about the, the greater ecosystem,

1108
00:45:58,179 --> 00:46:00,560
how many, how many projects are gonna do a release

1109
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:02,489
that, that might fall on that, let's say,

1110
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,739
let's say 10 or 20% which is still in the order of probably, you know,

1111
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:08,330
millions or billions of projects.

1112
00:46:08,719 --> 00:46:10,610
But, but fundamentally, I think

1113
00:46:10,949 --> 00:46:13,850
what's going to happen is it's gonna be huge and people are gonna freak

1114
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:16,469
out and there's gonna be tons of cycles that are spent on this.

1115
00:46:16,479 --> 00:46:20,280
But I bet you at the end of the day it's not a world ending problem.

1116
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:24,429
And the hope I have is that it will incentivize people

1117
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,429
to start cleaning up their act because I don't think anyone's going

1118
00:46:27,439 --> 00:46:30,550
to care or do anything about it until we see this happen.

1119
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:37,489
So the second data point we have, remember the Handbrake for Mac Os Handbrake is um

1120
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:39,709
uh let's see, like R DVD

1121
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:39,840
S

1122
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,739
-- they got
-- these guys. Was it Handbrake or was it

1123
00:46:42,909 --> 00:46:45,060
who, who got Neil by Handbrake? I remember this.

1124
00:46:45,449 --> 00:46:48,889
Well, anyways, they uh the Handbrake um

1125
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:55,959
uh the server download dot Handbrake dot fr uh The file was replaced between

1126
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,330
May 2nd and May 6th.

1127
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:01,770
Uh They have a 5050 chance of their system being infected by a Trojan.

1128
00:47:02,729 --> 00:47:03,600
And um

1129
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:03,929
yeah,

1130
00:47:04,129 --> 00:47:05,229
there was a mirror, right?

1131
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:09,729
Yeah. And, and there, there are multiple instances of mirrors being attacked.

1132
00:47:09,739 --> 00:47:12,830
I mean, this happened, I think it happened a squirrel mail at one point as well.

1133
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,760
I remember this.

1134
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:16,280
Yeah, that rings a bell

1135
00:47:16,449 --> 00:47:18,110
and, and it happens, right? Like

1136
00:47:18,489 --> 00:47:20,500
mirrors have been, have been nailed.

1137
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:23,040
Uh We've yet to see a source code management system get

1138
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:26,260
nailed and somebody release like a legitimate back door like that.

1139
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:31,280
But if I guess, I think something like the N PM ecosystem is probably a prime target,

1140
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:33,419
-- especially now that some attacker somewhere
-- has

1141
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,669
gems NP ma lot of these are, you know,

1142
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,340
the reality is a lot of these have, you know,

1143
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:44,149
like things where one or two devs have written stuff that is used really widely

1144
00:47:44,979 --> 00:47:48,030
and yeah, I mean, these guys may not have super awesome.

1145
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:53,929
Well, there was that, what did that guy do? Um hang on a second N PM password audit.

1146
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:55,320
There was a guy that or was it

1147
00:47:55,699 --> 00:47:56,300
github or something?

1148
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:59,870
Anyways, this guy did like an audit of sort of all the N PM or something accounts

1149
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:04,780
-- and found people using like 12345 six.
-- That doesn't surprise me even a little bit.

1150
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:08,620
And, and in fact, I know I mentioned this more than once in the podcast, is github

1151
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:11,699
changed it. So you can't look for private Rs A keys in github

1152
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:12,300
anymore

1153
00:48:12,449 --> 00:48:14,070
because there's so many of them.

1154
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:14,699
There,

1155
00:48:15,189 --> 00:48:15,639
here we go.

1156
00:48:15,899 --> 00:48:16,770
Yeah, it's uh

1157
00:48:17,709 --> 00:48:18,050
here we go.

1158
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,699
Gathering N PM credentials or how I obtained direct

1159
00:48:20,709 --> 00:48:23,290
publisher access to 14% of N PM packages.

1160
00:48:23,389 --> 00:48:27,790
-- What did that guy do? I remember this? But I don't recall. He
-- just basically um

1161
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:33,610
he, how did he do it? Blah, blah, blah.

1162
00:48:34,909 --> 00:48:40,439
Uh There are 73,983 public packages from 17,088 accounts

1163
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:44,570
about 14% of the whole N PM ecosystem. And that's a lot of packages.

1164
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:45,610
It's huge

1165
00:48:46,689 --> 00:48:47,370
numbers, man.

1166
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:50,149
So I believe you just tried

1167
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:51,629
brute forcing.

1168
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:57,439
Oh, he, yeah, like, wow, this is bad anyways, the the reality is like, you know,

1169
00:48:57,449 --> 00:48:58,879
given, well, here's the problem.

1170
00:48:58,889 --> 00:49:00,840
We're back into the law of large numbers,

1171
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:01,350
right?

1172
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:07,090
And so like it doesn't matter if we have 99.9% of these guys secure

1173
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,790
if you have 100.

1174
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:13,189
Well, no, wait, 14%. Yeah. So there's about like 100,000 accounts

1175
00:49:13,889 --> 00:49:16,530
that still leaves what 100 or so to be happy.

1176
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,110
And here's,

1177
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,149
here's the thing is we have a handful of

1178
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:22,439
really good attacks that were done by good guys.

1179
00:49:22,449 --> 00:49:23,000
Mind you

1180
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:26,429
against this ecosystem and nobody's really fixed anything.

1181
00:49:27,879 --> 00:49:31,040
Well, see, that's what drives me nuts is there's some really easy fixes for this,

1182
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:33,399
like deploy two factor authentication ideally

1183
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:38,870
-- because
-- what's going to happen is humanity doesn't change unless they have to.

1184
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:40,000
Right?

1185
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:41,860
See, well, and that's the thing, you can force it.

1186
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:46,840
Like, look, you want your N PM thing published, uh you have six months to buy into the,

1187
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:48,719
to go buy a UB key and start using it.

1188
00:49:49,129 --> 00:49:49,969
-- But
-- the N PM

1189
00:49:51,209 --> 00:49:52,800
and they obviously don't.

1190
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:53,550
-- Yeah,
-- I mean,

1191
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,860
well, and again, it comes back to that cost, right?

1192
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:57,790
If we do start booting N PM packages like

1193
00:49:57,949 --> 00:49:59,739
shift, then oops, we just broke like a

1194
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:04,479
suspicion is the N PM guys are probably overworked volunteers

1195
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:05,850
for sure.

1196
00:50:05,979 --> 00:50:08,909
And so that, that becomes part of the challenge as well.

1197
00:50:08,919 --> 00:50:12,080
Is, is you want what you want, you want me to do more work.

1198
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:13,850
And in fact, I see this all the time, right?

1199
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:16,929
As a security guy is, I'll show up and say, hey, we should do this and they're like,

1200
00:50:16,939 --> 00:50:17,770
I'm too busy already.

1201
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:20,419
I'm not doing that. It's like, right, it was fun talking to you all

1202
00:50:21,739 --> 00:50:24,310
someday. I'll be back. It won't be friendly

1203
00:50:24,739 --> 00:50:26,199
and, and yeah, then eventually they,

1204
00:50:26,209 --> 00:50:27,989
-- they get in trouble or something and then they come back in
-- and

1205
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:30,209
here's, well, and this goes to, uh, mud,

1206
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:33,239
you know, talking about, uh, having sort of automated software

1207
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:34,600
safety stuff.

1208
00:50:35,239 --> 00:50:37,459
If we, for example, had, uh,

1209
00:50:37,469 --> 00:50:40,600
some sort of rating system on like how secure is this package?

1210
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:41,909
You know, it could be things like

1211
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:44,280
some of the metrics would be like, oh, you know, the,

1212
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:47,810
the accounts associated with this use two factor authentication or they don't or,

1213
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:48,479
you know, they,

1214
00:50:48,489 --> 00:50:51,860
they at least use source control management or they publish to multiple mirrors.

1215
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:55,010
So if one gets hacked, it's gonna get noticed or, you know, things like that.

1216
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:57,100
And if you could have this metric,

1217
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:58,939
you know, published and then,

1218
00:50:59,229 --> 00:51:02,050
you know, it would be nice for me to be able to say, like, you know, look,

1219
00:51:02,189 --> 00:51:04,969
it's fine to use any software that has like a better than

1220
00:51:05,139 --> 00:51:08,719
50% security score and if it's less than 50% maybe notify me.

1221
00:51:08,729 --> 00:51:09,919
-- So I can take a
-- piece of ci I

1222
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:11,330
badges project

1223
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:11,760
is

1224
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:12,810
exactly.

1225
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:17,169
But, but even then it's, I don't, I haven't seen it really adopted widely yet

1226
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:22,090
and, and we've already kind of got that infrastructure built in the form of CV S,

1227
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:22,469
right?

1228
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:24,899
If this package has CV S, they need to be dealt with. And so,

1229
00:51:25,709 --> 00:51:28,050
but here's the thing, what's the incentive, right?

1230
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:31,850
-- If there's no incentive, nobody's going to do it, that's the reality.
-- I agree.

1231
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:36,209
And, and we just, we do not have incentive for security in many instances. Not yet.

1232
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:39,409
Well, we don't have incentives for really good security.

1233
00:51:39,419 --> 00:51:43,290
We have incentives for a lot of security theater because that gets

1234
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:45,250
the managers and other people

1235
00:51:45,439 --> 00:51:46,250
to go away,

1236
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:48,080
you know,

1237
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:51,669
and people keep, you know, well, it's like with the whole TLS SSL thing,

1238
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,199
the whole point,

1239
00:51:52,330 --> 00:51:55,159
you know, it's got a lock, you can plug your credit card number in safely.

1240
00:51:55,169 --> 00:51:56,379
I actually realized now, I,

1241
00:51:56,389 --> 00:51:58,370
I just so fundamentally don't care about my

1242
00:51:58,379 --> 00:52:00,040
credit card number being hacked because like,

1243
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:02,020
it's just a non-event, like you just go get a new one.

1244
00:52:02,129 --> 00:52:05,750
-- Get stolen
-- so often. I don't, yeah, I don't care. Whatever. It doesn't even matter.

1245
00:52:05,929 --> 00:52:08,719
-- Like some dodgy website wants it. I'm like, don't care going
-- in.

1246
00:52:08,729 --> 00:52:11,199
It's like using hand sanitizer. You just, it's just

1247
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:14,030
something, you know, it just happens.

1248
00:52:14,379 --> 00:52:14,620
No

1249
00:52:14,959 --> 00:52:16,320
-- big deal.
-- I hear you, man.

1250
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:17,939
Um,

1251
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:21,270
I care vaguely maybe about my personal information being

1252
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,439
stolen from a website because I can't change that.

1253
00:52:23,449 --> 00:52:27,659
You know, even that I, I've had my identity stolen so many times at this point.

1254
00:52:27,669 --> 00:52:30,500
It's like anyone who wants it, it's not even hard to find.

1255
00:52:30,649 --> 00:52:32,820
It's just I give up, there's nothing I can do about it.

1256
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:37,100
My credit's locked, that's the best I can do. I keep an eye on it. That's, that's it.

1257
00:52:37,449 --> 00:52:38,419
That, that's life, man.

1258
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:41,239
Yeah. Well, and that's the thing, right? Like if

1259
00:52:42,669 --> 00:52:42,709
I

1260
00:52:42,899 --> 00:52:44,830
wish we could somehow sort of make some of

1261
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:48,010
these hacking events basically into cheap non events.

1262
00:52:48,419 --> 00:52:48,469
Uh,

1263
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:51,729
well, a lot of them are cheap non events though. I mean, let's face it.

1264
00:52:51,739 --> 00:52:53,929
My identity has been stolen. My credit card's been stolen.

1265
00:52:53,939 --> 00:52:57,709
How many dollars have I actually lost because of any of this? $0?

1266
00:52:57,770 --> 00:53:01,189
I've lost a couple of hours of my time. Yes. But like, fundamentally

1267
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:03,570
I've lost relatively little

1268
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:04,159
all

1269
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:04,560
in all

1270
00:53:04,969 --> 00:53:05,280
and that

1271
00:53:05,739 --> 00:53:07,669
-- it's kind
-- of like the same thing with car crashes, right.

1272
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:12,290
Like, I know locally now the cops will not go to a car accident unless there's,

1273
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:13,350
you know, casualties.

1274
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,169
Right. Otherwise they're like,

1275
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:15,949
you phone the non

1276
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:18,860
emergency number and they're like, dial six if you've, you know,

1277
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:22,129
rear ended somebody dial seven if you ran a stop sign

1278
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:25,389
and like, you literally just go fill out a report.

1279
00:53:25,399 --> 00:53:28,530
You have like, I think it's a day or two to go do it after the accident

1280
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:31,679
-- and, and that's basically it. And then your insurance people
-- deal

1281
00:53:31,689 --> 00:53:31,870
with that,

1282
00:53:32,179 --> 00:53:32,449
man.

1283
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:33,010
I mean,

1284
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:33,909
well,

1285
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:36,850
I think most jurisdictions in Canada are like that now because quite

1286
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:40,060
frankly why would the cops come out to a car accident?

1287
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,830
Everybody has smartphones, they take pictures of the thing,

1288
00:53:43,449 --> 00:53:43,919
you know,

1289
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:47,719
unless like the other person is you think they're drunk or something you don't need,

1290
00:53:47,729 --> 00:53:48,169
like,

1291
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:51,429
I don't need a cop out for some, you know, minor rear end

1292
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:54,780
-- or whatever. I mean,
-- it's fair, man, I get it. It's,

1293
00:53:55,239 --> 00:53:58,820
I don't know, I, we've got growing up to do and I, I don't know how it's gonna end

1294
00:53:59,050 --> 00:53:59,939
but it's,

1295
00:54:00,139 --> 00:54:00,449
yeah,

1296
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:02,070
I don't know.

1297
00:54:03,179 --> 00:54:03,840
I guess

1298
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,629
I, I see no better place to end it than this because we have nothing to say. So,

1299
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:08,879
do you, you want the last word?

1300
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:12,949
Fundamentally, I want this to cost less money and hassle.

1301
00:54:13,169 --> 00:54:16,530
-- Uh
-- Yeah. Right. And, and that's, that's the intent, right?

1302
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:19,709
Is someday we'll get there, but we're not there today today.

1303
00:54:19,719 --> 00:54:22,550
Doing nothing is easier than doing something. So nothing wins.

1304
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:24,350
And that's just the way it's gonna be.

1305
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:25,100
I

1306
00:54:25,219 --> 00:54:28,139
mean, well, and I think we really have to have like a really,

1307
00:54:28,989 --> 00:54:31,290
like a really massive cultural shift,

1308
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:34,169
just like with cars right where they went from, like, denial and, you know,

1309
00:54:34,179 --> 00:54:36,610
like the smoking industry or the car industry or

1310
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:39,050
all these other industries that have undergone massive shifts.

1311
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:42,030
Security needs to do that because I'm pretty sure

1312
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,330
that what we're doing right now isn't really awesome.

1313
00:54:45,149 --> 00:54:48,379
-- Like I'm pretty sure there's a much better answer out there
-- without a doubt.

1314
00:54:48,389 --> 00:54:49,449
I, I have no doubt

1315
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:52,120
but yeah, I don't know, we're gonna find out,

1316
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,590
right? Oh,

1317
00:54:53,939 --> 00:54:54,590
thanks, man.

1318
00:54:54,699 --> 00:54:56,760
-- It was fun. As always, I guess
-- tweet us the answer if you know

1319
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:56,919
it.

1320
00:54:56,929 --> 00:54:58,830
Yes, please, by all means, let us know.

1321
00:54:59,040 --> 00:54:59,879
And on that note

1322
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:04,030
you can find all the show notes as well as links to how to tweet us.

1323
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,489
And we have a Facebook group you can hassle

1324
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:08,469
us at or whatever at open source security podcast.com.

1325
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:12,669
Uh Yeah, thanks, Kurt. Thanks everybody for listening. I certainly appreciate it.

1326
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:15,590
And yeah. Have you guys have a, have a great day?

1327
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,669
-- Enjoy the rest of summer
-- while it lasts.
