Hello and welcome to the Open source Security podcast episode 94 with myself,

1
00:00:09,659 --> 00:00:12,130
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,440
So I went to RS A and I came home with the con flu. So, that's pretty neat.

3
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:21,590
Yeah, I've, uh, I've heard from several people that something went around Rs A.

4
00:00:21,909 --> 00:00:25,549
Yeah, I mean, from, I guess, from a risk management perspective,

5
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,840
putting lots of security people in the same place

6
00:00:27,979 --> 00:00:29,010
is probably

7
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:32,020
-- this is what happened
-- and the fact that they all eat the same lunch, like,

8
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:32,409
or what is it?

9
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:34,250
You have like two choices for your lunch.

10
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:34,689
Uh,

11
00:00:35,319 --> 00:00:37,349
there's like no choice for lunch because everything

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,529
is so busy you can't actually get lunch.

13
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,250
So you,

14
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:44,400
you eat nothing and you shake hands and goodness knows what everyone has touched.

15
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:44,810
And

16
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,810
because I've just been watching on Netflix, we watch the, uh,

17
00:00:47,819 --> 00:00:49,634
the Wild Wild West documentary.

18
00:00:49,645 --> 00:00:50,875
You know about the,

19
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,845
essentially that cult in Oregon that, you know,

20
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:54,334
we

21
00:00:54,435 --> 00:00:56,665
tried to weaponize salmonella and

22
00:00:56,895 --> 00:00:59,334
make everybody sick on election day so that they could

23
00:00:59,924 --> 00:01:00,275
vote

24
00:01:00,534 --> 00:01:05,794
themselves into power and just go watch it on Netflix folks. It's just, it's,

25
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:06,925
I mean, it's, it's,

26
00:01:07,315 --> 00:01:10,724
they, they, they use the original, you know, footage.

27
00:01:10,735 --> 00:01:15,525
It's not like there, this is absolutely not hyperbole or

28
00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:19,510
like, literally everything that happened actually happened and they have like,

29
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,709
video footage of it.

30
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,910
Like, it's, it's just, it's too crazy to even begin to explain.

31
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,190
I, yeah, it's, it's on my list.

32
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,250
Well, we'll get to it someday. It's probably

33
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:31,989
right. I, I still haven't seen Ready Player One Man.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,830
And that movie has been out for a while. I read the book though. The book was great.

35
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:35,540
Yeah.

36
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:36,489
So anyway,

37
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:40,029
speaking of sort of major incidents, uh,

38
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,989
it sounds like somebody pulled off some shenanigans on Amazon the other day.

39
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:49,800
This story is crazy for many reasons.

40
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:54,349
And I, I think that the thing that I, I find is just the cherry on top is

41
00:01:55,129 --> 00:02:01,230
this was a really impressive attack on route 53 and B GP and DNS and everything.

42
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:03,510
The Steel Ethereum,

43
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:06,459
right? Like that was the goal. That's,

44
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:09,300
this is a super impressive attack.

45
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,029
You used it to steal Cryptocurrency.

46
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,350
Yeah. Well, I mean, that's money.

47
00:02:14,179 --> 00:02:15,720
I get untraceable money.

48
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:18,539
It's like, what was that famous bank Robber when he was asked, why did he rob banks?

49
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,940
And he's like, well, that's where the money is.

50
00:02:21,619 --> 00:02:25,029
Yes. I mean, I guess at the same time I,

51
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:26,919
I would imagine

52
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,929
there are, there are more lucrative opportunities with this sort of capability.

53
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,270
Here's a quick

54
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:33,759
question.

55
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,240
This is an organization.

56
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,360
Do they really have a lot of, um, for political clout to chase you down in,

57
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,380
-- in
-- this case. No.

58
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,259
And that is fair because if you're working with,

59
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:48,330
we'll say a questionable government or other organization,

60
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,419
uh, that's how you wake up dead.

61
00:02:50,929 --> 00:02:53,639
It's like those attacks on the swift banking system. Right.

62
00:02:53,649 --> 00:02:56,050
Those are actually real banks with, like,

63
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:58,110
people who have budgets to chase you down and

64
00:02:58,119 --> 00:02:59,899
to convince the government to chase you down.

65
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:05,419
Yeah, that's true. Right. And whereas like I'm guessing my Ether

66
00:03:05,529 --> 00:03:10,529
wallet.com doesn't have a whole lot of uh political influence or clout anywhere.

67
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:13,300
And this is assuming it's more than one guy much like, you know, mount gawk,

68
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,630
it probably nothing, nothing would surprise me

69
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:20,899
so well, why don't you give us a rundown of kind of what happened?

70
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,509
So, so this is my understanding and, and part of this as well is

71
00:03:24,899 --> 00:03:28,539
that the news keeps changing as more and more details emerge.

72
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:32,259
And I have no doubt there's way more to this story than,

73
00:03:33,029 --> 00:03:34,410
than we know today.

74
00:03:34,929 --> 00:03:36,050
And I guess

75
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,929
I, I also don't want to speculate too much. We'll speculate a little bit

76
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:43,720
speculation,

77
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:46,110
right. So my understanding is

78
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,649
basically somebody had the ability to

79
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:53,570
send fake B GP routing information around the internet

80
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,770
to essentially divert all of the Amazon route 53 traffic

81
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,779
into a data center in Chicago

82
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:03,139
where they then basically, I,

83
00:04:03,149 --> 00:04:04,440
I think using the word man in the

84
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:06,860
middle might be slightly incorrect in this instance,

85
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:07,830
-- but we'll just
-- say it.

86
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:09,289
No, technically it would be correct.

87
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,520
They, they redirected the traffic using

88
00:04:12,029 --> 00:04:12,240
that's

89
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:12,809
hijack.

90
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,419
That's fair. But then basically they,

91
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,660
they served up fake DNS traffic. They intercepted

92
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:23,420
http S requests to an Ethereum wallet service

93
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:27,350
and I guess he didn't even get a valid certificate, which it's like, come on,

94
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:28,299
guys get with it.

95
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:30,279
Well, that's kind of, I find that kind of

96
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,649
odd, to be honest. Yeah, that they, they were able to technologically pull this off

97
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,790
and then not get a certificate.

98
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:39,850
But the reality is apparently they didn't need a certificate because here's right.

99
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:43,049
Well, here's, this is basically

100
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:44,440
two failures. Number one,

101
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,959
the my ether wallet

102
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,769
uh website should have been using HSTS headers saying to web clients, you know, hey,

103
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:55,109
you're visiting me, you really should be visiting me on HTTP S not http,

104
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,309
right?

105
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,549
And if they'd done that,

106
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:02,510
then they would have, the attacker would have needed a valid HTTP S certificate.

107
00:05:02,809 --> 00:05:03,149
-- Uh
-- No,

108
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,630
my understanding is they didn't have a valid HTTP

109
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,750
S certificate and people still click through the warning

110
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:08,519
then in

111
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:08,700
that

112
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:08,989
case,

113
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,230
and again, this is how much of this is here saying conjecture as well.

114
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:16,380
Like I can't prove that that's just what I read somewhere.

115
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,959
And, and that

116
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,079
because

117
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:19,920
like,

118
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:20,980
um

119
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:21,799
I

120
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:24,369
mean, if I go to my online bank,

121
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,359
uh

122
00:05:25,549 --> 00:05:28,320
well, yeah, if I went to my online bank on a web browser and it

123
00:05:28,549 --> 00:05:30,920
gave me a certificate, error warning.

124
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:33,640
Uh, well, what I would do is I try the mobile client

125
00:05:34,549 --> 00:05:36,970
and see what happens there. And if that failed then,

126
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:41,609
well, the difference being with my bank is there's an actual physical local branch,

127
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:43,649
you know, in my city. Right,

128
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,320
with my ether wallet. Um,

129
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:52,209
who knows? I guess I have to log in whether I like it or not if I want to get my money,

130
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,470
you know, or wait, which, you know, people are not good at waiting,

131
00:05:55,609 --> 00:05:57,390
people are really not good at waiting.

132
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,119
But,

133
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:03,160
but I guess here's the more important part of this story I think is so this happens

134
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,260
and

135
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,859
watching Twitter for the last couple of days,

136
00:06:06,869 --> 00:06:09,329
watching security people argue with each other has

137
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:11,790
been hilarious because there's lots of people saying,

138
00:06:11,799 --> 00:06:15,869
oh, if they had DNS se this wouldn't be a problem or if we probably secured B GP,

139
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,179
this wouldn't be a problem or,

140
00:06:17,429 --> 00:06:19,619
you know, quit using route 53 and this won't be a problem

141
00:06:19,855 --> 00:06:20,644
and it's like

142
00:06:21,075 --> 00:06:24,924
nothing you people are saying is, is helpful to.

143
00:06:25,255 --> 00:06:26,195
-- It's one
-- of those,

144
00:06:26,315 --> 00:06:26,924
you know,

145
00:06:27,184 --> 00:06:27,684
we,

146
00:06:27,864 --> 00:06:28,565
we

147
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:32,195
definitely have widespread support for htps at this point,

148
00:06:32,204 --> 00:06:35,674
widespread mature support both on the client and on the server.

149
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:38,029
And yeah, we still get it wrong all the time.

150
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:42,070
Well, not only that, I mean, getting to where we are today has basically taken what,

151
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,410
-- 30 years of effort
-- and what, and there's an even bigger problem with DNS

152
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,299
E is with, with a web browser,

153
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:50,989
I'm interacting with a human being directly and I can be like, yo,

154
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,709
this certificate is wack yo,

155
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,269
like it's expired or it's not valid or it's the wrong name or it's

156
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,029
from some dude in Kazakhstan and you really want to trust them.

157
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:04,510
But with DNS Sec, it's like, you know, my, my web client is getting an error

158
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,630
then,

159
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,929
well, assuming

160
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,209
you going back to your experience where you had your web client set up to, um,

161
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,010
hard fail on certificate errors.

162
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:16,609
And, you know, it lasted for 15 minutes before you gave up.

163
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,390
That's the problem with DNS SE C, right. If you, if you

164
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:23,410
have your DNS EC resolver being very strict,

165
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,609
yeah, a bunch of stuff is going to break

166
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,220
and people hate that. Right. So, they'll, they'll turn it off in a heartbeat. Right.

167
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,690
There's people that still don't wear their seatbelts because they're like,

168
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,850
it rumples my shirt.

169
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:34,859
Um. Right. And I mean,

170
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,100
yeah,

171
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,380
so,

172
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,910
yeah, di in a sec,

173
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,660
if it was 100%

174
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,269
supported. Awesome. And

175
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:46,790
100% or close to it. Correct.

176
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,089
So, there weren't these false positive problems of like, oh,

177
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:52,079
the website is broken because of some weird wonky DNS error

178
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,869
then? Yeah, that would be awesome. But I mean, yeah, we're nowhere near that.

179
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,230
Well, not only that DNS Sec is really hard to get. Right.

180
00:07:59,869 --> 00:07:59,880
I

181
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:05,250
mean, people can't get most things right. Expecting them to get DNS SEC. Right?

182
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,579
Is, is probably too high of a bar.

183
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:10,299
-- I think
-- we just need the same model that we've shown works

184
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:14,880
for HTTP S which is you outsource it to a larger competent organization

185
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:15,920
end of story. And

186
00:08:16,109 --> 00:08:19,950
I, I do agree with that and that might be the answer that makes this happen.

187
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:22,399
I mean, like a great example here is

188
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:27,440
it is, it is conceivable. Amazon could make this work in route 53.

189
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,040
They don't,

190
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:31,040
my guess is because they probably don't see a valid

191
00:08:31,049 --> 00:08:33,299
return on investment today because no one's probably asked.

192
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,539
No, no, no, they support.

193
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:39,080
I was under the impression of 53 does not do.

194
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:43,340
I'm pretty sure route 53. Yeah, they support it. They have for a long time.

195
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:44,000
Oh yeah,

196
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:47,080
they do DNS sec. So people just aren't using it then.

197
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:47,549
Yeah,

198
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:49,869
they uh blah blah blah Attackers sometimes hijack

199
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,690
traffic to internet and or sorry to internet endpoints

200
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,710
such as web servers by intercepting DNS queries

201
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:56,419
and returning their own IP addresses to DNS.

202
00:08:56,429 --> 00:08:58,719
Resolves in place of the actual IP addresses for these endpoints.

203
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,510
Users are then routed to the IP addresses

204
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,380
provided by the Attackers in the spoofed response,

205
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,530
for example, to fake websites.

206
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:04,630
Uh Just to be clear,

207
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,710
this is the first result for route 53 DNS SE C which is the Amazon documentation

208
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:11,979
and then they tell you how to uh

209
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,340
to enable it.

210
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:14,599
Uh

211
00:09:15,309 --> 00:09:19,640
blah blah blah sign into your Aws, go to registered domains, uh, at the DNS E

212
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,599
field. Choose manage keys, blah, blah, blah, click, click. And you're done.

213
00:09:24,909 --> 00:09:26,909
No, no, no. I mean, they, they've supported this.

214
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:27,640
Well,

215
00:09:27,849 --> 00:09:31,369
yeah, but the problem is you turn it on and then a bunch of clients stop working

216
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:32,690
and people complain.

217
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,010
Yeah, that's probably true.

218
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,559
You know, or you turn it on and like a lot of HTTP S stuff,

219
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,969
you do it slightly wrong or a bunch wrong.

220
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,369
Um, although I'm guessing knowing, you know,

221
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,609
having had experience of the Aws tools,

222
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:49,010
they generally don't let you poke yourself too hard in the face with a sharp spork.

223
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:51,960
Yeah. So, I mean, they could have totally turned on DNS EC but again, who does that?

224
00:09:51,969 --> 00:09:53,840
And more to the point, how many clients have that enabled?

225
00:09:53,849 --> 00:09:57,049
I mean, again, I tried DNS sec strict for a while.

226
00:09:57,059 --> 00:09:59,489
Turned it off because, yeah, it was not super fun.

227
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,700
Well, in ironically as well, in

228
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,929
this particular instance,

229
00:10:04,969 --> 00:10:07,229
if you can take over B GP,

230
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:12,239
you could just take the IP address of the web server. Well, potentially, right?

231
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:16,289
So even if it's returning IP addresses and you can attack B GP,

232
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:20,770
you can essentially move the IP routing to wherever you are

233
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:25,039
and DNS set can be valid and you could still mount a similar attack,

234
00:10:25,609 --> 00:10:26,000
-- which
-- is

235
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:26,969
really

236
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:27,169
funny.

237
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:28,960
I hate to say it, but yeah,

238
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,119
DNS E would not have helped here because yeah, the,

239
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,320
apparently the attacker was able to hijack Amazon IP space.

240
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:34,979
Uh,

241
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:35,460
well,

242
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:35,630
in

243
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:36,940
this instance,

244
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:41,109
it sounds like they were specifically hijacking the route 53 traffic.

245
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:43,020
Right. Not, not the web traffic.

246
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:49,500
So, like in this particular attack DNS SEC would potentially have helped,

247
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,109
-- well,
-- or they just would have hijacked that space as well.

248
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:59,359
-- Maybe II, I have no idea
-- because apparently the hijack lasted for about a good solid

249
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:00,640
two hours.

250
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:04,960
That's what I heard was about two hours and, and not only that, my suspicion is

251
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:06,869
two hours isn't that long.

252
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,239
You figure an organization like Amazon has a lot of tooling.

253
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,080
I'll bet you, they knew something was up in a couple of minutes.

254
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:16,669
But then it's going to take probably at least

255
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:18,989
half an hour to figure out what just happened.

256
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,340
Right. And seeing something

257
00:11:21,099 --> 00:11:21,289
being

258
00:11:21,429 --> 00:11:23,309
messed up. B GP. RO monitoring is the thing.

259
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,619
But then the problem is you have to go thump

260
00:11:25,909 --> 00:11:27,690
somebody with a hammer and get their

261
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,900
upstream ISP to, you know, block it off because,

262
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,590
I mean, the problem with B GP is

263
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,760
it's, it's essentially a trust based

264
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:39,559
protocol and that, like, I trust that, you know, these people are not gonna, like,

265
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,239
randomly hijack stuff because we've had that right.

266
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,669
Where, what was it in India or something?

267
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:45,969
Or Pakistan, they accidentally or otherwise hijacked,

268
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:49,599
you know, was it Google or Twitter or something? I mean, this happens quite often.

269
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:51,690
Um, there are,

270
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:53,690
uh, there are,

271
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,539
there is a security protocol to prevent that.

272
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,190
But the problem is like, everybody has to do that. And,

273
00:11:58,469 --> 00:12:01,349
you know, even if like say 90% of North America does that, well,

274
00:12:01,359 --> 00:12:03,969
then you'd still have 10% of North America, you know, having

275
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,880
listening to the hijacked route and honoring it. I mean,

276
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:10,229
a great example of this is cloud flare.

277
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,799
Uh set up a new public DNS resolver much like Google's.

278
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:20,380
So Google has two DNS resolver which are pretty nifty 8.8 0.8 0.8 and 8.8 0.4 0.4.

279
00:12:20,979 --> 00:12:25,429
Uh Cloud flare got a hold of 1.1 0.1 0.1 super easy, you know,

280
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:30,179
and it turns out a whole bunch of people are using that IP address for stuff,

281
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:31,820
right?

282
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,830
And so cloud floor had like a blog entry and, and, you know,

283
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,919
they literally had to reach out to all these I SPS and be like,

284
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:42,130
you know, why, why are you actually routing 1.1 0.1 0.1 into your network?

285
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:45,820
What are you doing it with it? Like, please stop doing that. That's R IP.

286
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:48,700
Um There's a bunch of hardware manufacturers that like

287
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:53,510
bind 1.1 0.1 0.1 to a local interface for God knows what reason.

288
00:12:53,979 --> 00:12:54,770
Um

289
00:12:54,969 --> 00:12:55,710
You know, and just,

290
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,359
I mean, yeah, just all sorts of wackiness.

291
00:12:59,369 --> 00:13:03,369
Um Hundreds of organizations have apparently chosen to, you know,

292
00:13:04,229 --> 00:13:09,849
-- use this for God knows why So
-- I've got a funny story about that is,

293
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,880
I remember a long time ago I was working at this place.

294
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,359
I was, you know, young and

295
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,330
I, I was eager and ready to go

296
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,809
and

297
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:22,619
back then, you know, you've got your I PV four only there was,

298
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,320
I don't even think I PV six was deployed by anybody.

299
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:28,700
In any way. You obviously generally have your internal network, right?

300
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:32,340
And depending upon most organizations would just use

301
00:13:32,349 --> 00:13:35,099
the 10.0 0.0 to zero slash eight.

302
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:38,820
Right? Because you've got like a gazillion IP. S you never run out. Nobody cares.

303
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:43,719
And there's the other one you'll see a lot, lot in use is 192.168

304
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,919
you know, slash 16.

305
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:53,200
And I remember I, I start my job and they're using 172.1 0.1 0.1 and I'm like,

306
00:13:53,409 --> 00:13:57,020
whoa, this isn't a private IP. And the guy was like, oh, it is,

307
00:13:57,299 --> 00:13:59,349
it is 172 is private. IP, I

308
00:13:59,500 --> 00:13:59,619
think

309
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:06,210
-- 1 72.16. Right?
-- That's 16 to 31. It's what, like a slash slash 12 maybe.

310
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,070
I think, I think

311
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:08,280
12 anyway, it doesn't matter.

312
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:12,760
And I remember like this is, this is a real IP, you can't use that

313
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:13,760
and,

314
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,799
and I remember he started arguing with me and I had

315
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:18,429
to show him like the RFC defining all this stuff.

316
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,539
He's like, 00, well, it's never been a problem. Before. So, who cares? I'm thinking?

317
00:14:22,849 --> 00:14:25,289
-- No, like this is not how
-- life

318
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:26,960
-- works.
-- Didn't this happen to you at your gym?

319
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,479
Your gym was using some

320
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,640
random block of IP

321
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:31,090
space.

322
00:14:31,349 --> 00:14:36,150
-- They
-- were
-- also using, uh, the 172 space. In fact, that's what it was.

323
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,090
That's right. That's right. They fix that.

324
00:14:38,099 --> 00:14:41,390
They've since moved to a 192.168 IP space.

325
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:42,229
Uh,

326
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:46,289
not because I told them I didn't tell them anything but that's right because in fact,

327
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:50,659
uh, uh there's some Google services hosted off of the 172 dot something space.

328
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:51,159
I believe

329
00:14:51,619 --> 00:14:53,260
that that is where this is a problem and like

330
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,900
Google should have enough sense not to do that.

331
00:14:54,909 --> 00:14:55,450
Right. Because

332
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,010
people screw things up,

333
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,059
you know, I guess this is like the moral of the story, right? Is

334
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,359
if the technology is too hard to use and I'm going to like, pick on I PV six here where

335
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:10,539
I PV six in theory is vastly superior to I PV four except it's harder to use.

336
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,469
And my I

337
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,849
SPS don't support it.

338
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:14,700
Well, then your ISP,

339
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,659
you have that like big fat data connection, you

340
00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:17,900
have I PV six.

341
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,979
So the two local, big I SPS tell us and Shaw do not support I PV six yet.

342
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:24,030
The smaller I SPS like Tech Savvy do

343
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,859
because, well, simply because tech Savvy is, you know,

344
00:15:27,869 --> 00:15:29,030
running on their infrastructure.

345
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:30,599
So they're having to do tunneling anyways

346
00:15:30,979 --> 00:15:33,020
so boom, I PV Six. Right. Easy.

347
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:33,799
Whereas,

348
00:15:34,229 --> 00:15:36,090
tell us and, or Shaw would actually

349
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,119
have to,

350
00:15:37,299 --> 00:15:39,169
I'm guessing the main problem is they would

351
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:40,950
have to upgrade all their point of presence stuff

352
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,690
in the neighborhoods because I'm sure they bought

353
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,450
whatever the cheapest thing they could buy is.

354
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:45,640
Right.

355
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:50,880
That talks, I PV four, which, you know, five years ago or whatever years ago was fine,

356
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:51,960
still is fine.

357
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,400
Except, yeah, it would be kind of nice to have I PV six support.

358
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,520
Interesting. I

359
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:56,780
didn't

360
00:15:56,979 --> 00:15:58,280
and I'm not going to do a tunnel because the

361
00:15:58,289 --> 00:16:00,130
latency and everything is going to be a nightmare.

362
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,429
Interesting. But you get the point though, right? Like this is a great example

363
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:05,349
where

364
00:16:05,729 --> 00:16:07,969
it's hard enough to use and there hasn't, like,

365
00:16:07,979 --> 00:16:12,109
unless people are forced to do this stuff and I have a suspicion like HTTP S

366
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,719
was probably forced on people more so due to things like PC I compliance

367
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:21,200
than, than having an altruistic view of humanity and that too. Right.

368
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:25,039
I mean, that was obviously a huge, huge one there and chrome obviously and,

369
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:27,409
and I believe Firefox are going to start marking,

370
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:32,599
you know HEP sites is insecure and that's going to give things a huge push as well.

371
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:36,830
But you look at things like DNS sec and B GP and I PV six and this other stuff,

372
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:41,169
what is, what is pushing us towards using it? Right.

373
00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:43,030
And you can say, oh, well, we're running out of I PV,

374
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,799
four addresses and like we've been running out of I

375
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:47,390
PV four addresses as long as I can remember.

376
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,909
Right. And so nobody takes that seriously anymore.

377
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,989
And, and, well, I understand we really are this time but it doesn't matter. Right.

378
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,359
It's

379
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:56,169
the

380
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:00,690
thing to remember is, is, is like all the mobile devices in most of

381
00:17:00,859 --> 00:17:02,669
the world are I PV six space now.

382
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:07,589
So like all the new hardware and the new networks are I PV six only because,

383
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,310
well, yeah, I mean, you can't get I PV for addresses for Love or Money.

384
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:15,079
You know, they're the, like when companies go bankrupt now those,

385
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,209
like if they have a block of addresses that

386
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:20,569
that's an asset that's being sold to,

387
00:17:20,729 --> 00:17:20,969
you know,

388
00:17:20,979 --> 00:17:23,709
usually a company like Google or Amazon or Microsoft's buying it because

389
00:17:23,719 --> 00:17:26,329
they need huge blocks of I PV four for their cloud services.

390
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:26,790
You know, because

391
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,020
all of the schmucks like you and me who want to run a

392
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,410
web server on I PV four because we don't know any better.

393
00:17:32,729 --> 00:17:33,849
That's right. You know.

394
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:34,569
Right.

395
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,060
Yeah, I know.

396
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:40,540
But what really gets me is fundamentally these, these security protocols rely

397
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:41,500
on

398
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,579
the end user,

399
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,020
right?

400
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:49,420
And worse than that is that they have a quite a high number of like false positives,

401
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,579
right? If you actually turn it on and enforce it, it's like, oh,

402
00:17:53,069 --> 00:17:57,400
you know, it's one thing to block email attachments like dot exe and dot Bat and.com.

403
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,180
Cool. Right. Those like very few false positives there nowadays.

404
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:04,079
Um, but for example, you know, I remember, uh,

405
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,630
dealing with some places that block dot zip down.

406
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,310
I'm kind of like,

407
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:09,699
uh huh. Well, that's a problem.

408
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:12,739
Yeah. Well, I, I guess

409
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,579
here's the way I look at this

410
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:15,459
is

411
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:22,229
and, and we can even tie this back to TLS and HTTP S is back when this stuff came out.

412
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:24,180
Like it did suck. And it failed a lot.

413
00:18:24,189 --> 00:18:26,709
I remember going to lots of websites and getting certificate errors.

414
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:28,150
It was very, very common.

415
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:31,640
And then over the years we've cleaned up our messes

416
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:34,589
and we've learned and we've made the user experience better

417
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:35,989
-- and I think the fundamental,
-- I

418
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:37,729
wouldn't

419
00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:37,890
say

420
00:18:39,709 --> 00:18:40,420
we're not better

421
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:40,910
yet.

422
00:18:41,089 --> 00:18:44,670
But, but here's the thing like DNS Sec hasn't had that.

423
00:18:44,949 --> 00:18:49,199
And while you can talk about the security advantages all day long and I'm not gonna,

424
00:18:49,209 --> 00:18:53,930
I'm not gonna disagree that there aren't enormous benefits to getting DNS SE C,

425
00:18:53,939 --> 00:18:54,400
right?

426
00:18:54,739 --> 00:18:57,569
They're just, if you look at the return on investment,

427
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,479
it's, it's zero for most organizations, right? Why would you do that?

428
00:19:02,489 --> 00:19:04,969
There's literally no upside to them supporting it.

429
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:07,619
The only thing I can see is there's a few things

430
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:11,579
where you can leverage DNS as a distribution mechanism for say,

431
00:19:11,589 --> 00:19:14,640
encryption keys or other bits of information that are useful

432
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:19,319
and they're having that be now a trustworthy platform is actually kind of valuable.

433
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:25,180
Uh but again, those use cases are on the rare side compared to the typical use case,

434
00:19:25,189 --> 00:19:27,430
which is, you know, they're just using DNS to serve DNS,

435
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:28,430
you

436
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:31,930
get people to their website and email server and beyond that they could care less.

437
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:33,040
Right. And, and I,

438
00:19:33,829 --> 00:19:33,930
sorry.

439
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,670
Exactly.

440
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,150
I would imagine

441
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:40,280
there are organizations that want to use DN

442
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,969
SS for key distribution or something like that.

443
00:19:42,979 --> 00:19:45,469
And that's fine and they're, they're quite likely doing it.

444
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:48,530
But that also suggests they have a certain level of expertise

445
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,630
in house to even understand a lot of this stuff,

446
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:53,939
right? And, and that's the thing, man, this is,

447
00:19:54,739 --> 00:19:57,229
this is one of the things I actually realized that at

448
00:19:57,239 --> 00:20:00,280
RS A as well is you're talking to a lot of people

449
00:20:00,609 --> 00:20:01,280
and

450
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:06,550
the, the industry is so wide now and there's so much going on that, that

451
00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:08,949
everyone has their little niche,

452
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,780
but in general expecting anyone to really grasp a

453
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:14,949
lot of this stuff at scale is impossible.

454
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,459
And so you might be a DNS E expert in your

455
00:20:17,469 --> 00:20:19,349
organization and you might go to your leadership and say,

456
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,790
like we should do this and like, I don't even know what you're talking about.

457
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,180
Go away. Right.

458
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:27,189
It's just the challenges are enormous and I, I don't know,

459
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:29,989
I, I don't know how we're going to solve them. Right.

460
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,920
Well, part of it is, it has to be really cheap and easy to,

461
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:35,670
that's number one, we have to reduce the cost of doing this.

462
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:38,890
Ideally, number two, we have to add some benefit.

463
00:20:39,219 --> 00:20:41,140
That's, that might be number one,

464
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:45,079
I, I haven't seen any killer use cases for this yet.

465
00:20:45,349 --> 00:20:46,079
You know what I mean?

466
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:47,560
Um I, I just checked my,

467
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:51,420
my two I SPS Shawn tell us also don't use DNS EC for their own domains,

468
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,869
not that it would really matter.

469
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,069
But

470
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:54,849
so like, you know,

471
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:57,560
everybody will set up an expensive ecommerce platform because then

472
00:20:57,569 --> 00:20:59,260
you can sell stuff to people and make money.

473
00:20:59,500 --> 00:20:59,959
Right.

474
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,699
That makes sense. Yes,

475
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,750
I, so, you know, that's the problem though, is DNS EC is plumbing,

476
00:21:06,219 --> 00:21:09,910
DNS SEC is, is low level, like low

477
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,760
level plumbing,

478
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,479
you know,

479
00:21:11,609 --> 00:21:14,329
and as long as it works and doesn't flood your house and mess up your floors,

480
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:14,979
who cares?

481
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,270
-- Right. And, and you should have a chief plumbing officer. Yeah. Exactly.
-- Exactly.

482
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,400
And so, I mean, I,

483
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,930
I don't see,

484
00:21:24,229 --> 00:21:27,250
you know, I, I've heard a lot of people talk about, oh, security is an enabler.

485
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:31,239
Well, yeah, it does enable some things. But DNS ec, fundamentally,

486
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,880
DNS EC doesn't fundamentally enable something you can't do without it really, it,

487
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,459
it would be less trustworthy

488
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,219
and quite frankly, you know,

489
00:21:39,229 --> 00:21:42,739
while we have people clicking through their HTTP S warning, so

490
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:43,390
that's

491
00:21:43,579 --> 00:21:43,709
not that

492
00:21:44,479 --> 00:21:48,420
the world has basically been surviving without DNS second at this point.

493
00:21:48,689 --> 00:21:49,420
And so

494
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,939
claiming it's, it's extremely important

495
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:57,060
is probably at best a lie. I think it's it's certainly not

496
00:21:57,189 --> 00:21:57,930
the honest truth.

497
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:58,939
Honestly,

498
00:21:58,949 --> 00:22:02,180
the biggest use case I would see for DNS SEC is

499
00:22:02,189 --> 00:22:06,819
the I SPS that are monkeying with DNS replies from clients

500
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,060
to either,

501
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:13,810
you know, replace the ads or inject ads or, you know, that kind of stuff.

502
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:14,739
Um,

503
00:22:15,729 --> 00:22:20,369
and again, that's really, you know, oh, Wild google.com doesn't even do DNS SEC.

504
00:22:21,969 --> 00:22:24,160
And again, it's probably because of an availability thing. Right.

505
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,560
They don't want to break it for everybody.

506
00:22:27,069 --> 00:22:28,020
Um,

507
00:22:28,229 --> 00:22:28,869
interesting.

508
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,859
Yeah, I totally thought they would have done it.

509
00:22:30,989 --> 00:22:37,339
-- I mean, I'm sure those Android phones from 1995 are doing DNS E just fine.
-- Right.

510
00:22:37,349 --> 00:22:39,109
So, I mean, yeah, that's the problem is

511
00:22:39,469 --> 00:22:43,260
until it becomes essentially, basically free to implement.

512
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,199
We don't have that use case that makes it compelling enough.

513
00:22:47,209 --> 00:22:49,660
Like, e-commerce, like, having a web server.

514
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:52,729
Everybody has a web server now because, well, partly you have to, otherwise I'm not,

515
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:54,099
you know, nobody's going to talk to you.

516
00:22:54,609 --> 00:22:56,699
Um, and also because you can sell stuff to people or whatever.

517
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,040
Yeah. Right. Right.

518
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,280
And, and now I could see an instance where if something like PC,

519
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:06,000
I compliance or SOC two or something said you have to use DNS SEC

520
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:11,270
that, that now gives someone an economic incentive right to care.

521
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,910
But at the same time, like, trying to

522
00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:15,670
incentive though, it's, you know,

523
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,550
it's like saying you have to spend $1000 every year on new windows on your house.

524
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,630
Yeah. The Glazers Association would love that

525
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:25,130
and the Rock Throwers Association would probably go out of business. But, you know,

526
00:23:25,869 --> 00:23:30,770
um, again, does that really buy us a huge advantage? Because I, I,

527
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,239
like you said, I mean, it's,

528
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,250
yeah, I,

529
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,689
I haven't seen a very strong compelling use case where DNS

530
00:23:36,699 --> 00:23:38,910
Sec lets me do something I could not do before.

531
00:23:38,949 --> 00:23:41,290
Right. And, and that's what it really comes down to.

532
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,410
I mean, you could, you could honestly make a similar argument though

533
00:23:44,729 --> 00:23:47,329
around TLS way back in the day

534
00:23:47,739 --> 00:23:50,699
because I mean, there was a time when, when man, in the middling,

535
00:23:50,709 --> 00:23:52,770
all of the internet was unheard of.

536
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,189
Right?

537
00:23:53,689 --> 00:23:56,359
And so I remember there were lots of organizations that were like, oh, it's fine.

538
00:23:56,369 --> 00:23:57,300
You can take your credit card.

539
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,849
Is now, is that my I SPS man in the middle in me because for example,

540
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:02,500
if I type a domain or something,

541
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,160
they show me a helpful search page rather than an error.

542
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:08,479
-- I don't think DNS E could help with that though. What it
-- uh

543
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,920
well,

544
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:10,500
I mean, it depend

545
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,150
on how they're doing garbage.

546
00:24:12,329 --> 00:24:14,640
-- Yeah,
-- but I mean, no, I've had um

547
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,069
well, the

548
00:24:16,739 --> 00:24:19,329
in theory, if we had DNS E at the full root level and everything,

549
00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:22,859
then I would know for sure that there was an NX like no existing domain, right?

550
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:26,250
And again, that's again, but this isn't gonna happen anytime soon. So

551
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:27,890
fundamentally, as far as I can tell,

552
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,540
really the only thing that's going to drive people to like,

553
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:33,170
protect their man in the middle attacks is ad revenue

554
00:24:35,969 --> 00:24:36,640
fundamentally. Uh,

555
00:24:37,369 --> 00:24:40,449
because what other economic incentive is there to really

556
00:24:40,459 --> 00:24:42,310
strongly avoid man in the middle of attacks?

557
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,079
You know, uh,

558
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,550
banks and stuff,

559
00:24:44,949 --> 00:24:46,560
you know, that they're not going to eat the cost.

560
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,359
They're just going to pass it on to somebody or

561
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,890
like my ether wallet, you know, they're just going to claim, look,

562
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,540
it didn't have a valid certificate like Jesus.

563
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:56,209
-- What do you want us to do? You know,
-- they'll probably just go out of business. Right.

564
00:24:56,219 --> 00:24:59,270
Like close up shop. Say it was fun. And then what do you do?

565
00:24:59,410 --> 00:24:59,800
You know?

566
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,060
Yeah. So, uh, no, it's,

567
00:25:04,739 --> 00:25:05,400
yeah, I don't know.

568
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:08,160
I mean, fundamentally the internet largely runs on trust,

569
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,719
especially with things like B GP.

570
00:25:09,729 --> 00:25:10,229
Um,

571
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,770
and it's a boil the ocean problem.

572
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:13,989
You know,

573
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,050
even if you get 90% compliance that still leaves

574
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,930
10% of humanity being man in the middle,

575
00:25:17,939 --> 00:25:19,550
which is enough to make it worthwhile.

576
00:25:20,229 --> 00:25:21,380
Right. Exactly.

577
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,020
Well, that's fun

578
00:25:24,969 --> 00:25:25,060
that

579
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:28,589
we should all just give up. Right. I think that,

580
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:29,979
I

581
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:30,599
don't know

582
00:25:30,699 --> 00:25:31,000
about

583
00:25:31,209 --> 00:25:31,569
mud hut.

584
00:25:33,459 --> 00:25:36,920
Speaking of canned food. That was, uh, what was it? Why did that come up?

585
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:37,969
We were talking and you, the

586
00:25:38,099 --> 00:25:41,000
Franklin expedition. That's right. Lead poisoning in the Franklin expedition.

587
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:43,650
-- And then, then I looked it up and it turns out it wasn't the canned,
-- I was

588
00:25:43,949 --> 00:25:45,589
-- the wrong thing in school. It was
-- the

589
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,079
water.

590
00:25:46,369 --> 00:25:46,530
Yeah.

591
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,469
Well, it was the water going through fresh lead pipes, hot water,

592
00:25:49,479 --> 00:25:50,520
going through fresh lead pipes.

593
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:51,510
No scaling,

594
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,359
picking up a ton of lead.

595
00:25:53,369 --> 00:25:57,189
And then they were baking bread and bis, you know, they were baking stuff,

596
00:25:57,199 --> 00:25:58,119
feeding it to the officers.

597
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,739
So the officers got an unholy amount of lead in their system.

598
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:05,430
And so, like when they, the ship got stuck as happens back in the day,

599
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:07,430
when you try to do the northwest passage in a,

600
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,140
like wooden boat

601
00:26:09,479 --> 00:26:12,800
and not like a nuclear powered icebreaker, which is the correct way of doing it.

602
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:16,140
Uh They basically hauled a life boat off with a bunch of stuff,

603
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:18,400
including the ship's table and some other random odds and ends.

604
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,780
I think they took all the silverware,

605
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,709
uh, you know, and, and tried to head south, which again,

606
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:25,520
that's not gonna go real well because it's several.

607
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:26,920
Well then, yeah,

608
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:30,500
it's over 1000 miles kind of to anything remotely approaching civilization,

609
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,150
especially back in that day.

610
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,079
Right. Right. So they all died.

611
00:26:34,229 --> 00:26:37,910
-- Indeed.
-- A classic tale of adventure in the 18 hundreds.

612
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:41,599
Right. They were, they were pioneers just like people in DS

613
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,520
DNS. E

614
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,229
today are pioneers, right?

615
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:46,780
Pioneers get the arrows, man.

616
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,250
Yeah,

617
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,229
it's,

618
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,280
yeah, it's, it's just the way it is.

619
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,609
All right. So, I guess in summary

620
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:58,819
we're all doomed except we're not because everything still works

621
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,849
pretty much. Yeah.

622
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:04,420
And really don't avoid those ssl errors when you go to like your banking website or

623
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:04,880
your

624
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,790
ecommerce slash,

625
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,420
you know, Bitcoin website, like

626
00:27:09,709 --> 00:27:11,900
your browser is trying to tell you something. It might be important.

627
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,030
You know,

628
00:27:14,469 --> 00:27:18,229
I don't know if you've tried to click through certificate errors recently,

629
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:20,670
but it's a lot harder to do than it used to be.

630
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:26,380
Although I also see them much more rarely than I used to, which is great because

631
00:27:26,969 --> 00:27:30,430
it, I remember, man, it used to be super common

632
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:31,489
to see

633
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,969
t the, the SSL warning strategy.

634
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:34,479
I mean,

635
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,040
Iran

636
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,030
websites with self signed certificates for ages because,

637
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,270
right, why not?

638
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,140
We all did? Right. Right.

639
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,540
Well, in, in certificates were hard to get and they were expensive

640
00:27:44,349 --> 00:27:44,729
in other.

641
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:46,219
Yeah.

642
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:50,650
So anyway, anyway. All right. Right. I, I think that's enough of that.

643
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,729
Ok. Well, thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.
