Hello and welcome to episode 27 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:11,289
Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime.

2
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,069
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,979
Hello, Kurt. How are you doing

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,670
quite well? Finally over yet another virus my kids brought home.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,879
Yeah, I'm still not. I, I have a terrible head cold still. Like, it won't go away.

6
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:24,360
I, I don't know. Maybe this is just how I have to live from now on.

7
00:00:25,069 --> 00:00:26,940
I, yeah, I worry about that.

8
00:00:27,799 --> 00:00:29,360
-- Kids are filthy.
-- They

9
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:30,379
are.

10
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:31,299
But, you know,

11
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:34,180
it kind of what it reminds me of is it's like being on the modern internet,

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:36,590
you know,

13
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:38,090
that's

14
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:38,549
not,

15
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:39,779
I'm talking 20 years ago,

16
00:00:40,319 --> 00:00:42,549
man, except like the internet will.

17
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:42,880
No,

18
00:00:42,889 --> 00:00:44,540
the internet is like your kids bringing home the

19
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:46,779
plague and then everyone dies three days later.

20
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,740
I mean, it's not even comparable.

21
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:51,520
Well, no, I mean, you know, the internet is bad but

22
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:55,720
the internet is what would happen if none of us had immune systems.

23
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,099
That is what the internet is

24
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:00,959
-- or washed our hands, I guess. Yeah,
-- I, no, no, because

25
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,770
I suspect there are people who don't wash

26
00:01:03,779 --> 00:01:06,059
their hands and they still live relatively productive.

27
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:08,400
And meaningful lives. So we'll say immune system.

28
00:01:09,089 --> 00:01:09,510
Yeah.

29
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,349
So, speaking of immune system, uh,

30
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,870
looks like some NTP massive attack occurred last

31
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,260
month and then they sort of figured out

32
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,760
-- it was a bit of an
-- oopsy

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,269
attack. We'll put those in, get your air quotes back out. Kurt.

34
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:26,930
It was not an attack. It apparently was

35
00:01:27,559 --> 00:01:28,190
Snapchat.

36
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:32,389
That's true. It still was an attack. It just wasn't really on purpose.

37
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:34,099
It was, it was a Snapchat

38
00:01:34,279 --> 00:01:35,309
app update,

39
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,900
did something that started pounding on the NTP pool,

40
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,069
which I know we discussed a couple episodes ago,

41
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,120
but there's essentially a public NTP pool that

42
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:47,760
basically anyone can join and anyone can query.

43
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:51,580
And it's basically just what is it pool.ntp.org.

44
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:57,099
But they also, I, so I was doing some reading here and they ask vendors not to do this

45
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,430
where they want a vendor to basically get their

46
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,010
own little kind of sub domain of ntp.org.

47
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:06,690
So you have like one dot vendor dot NTP

48
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:11,008
pool.org, I think it is and then two dot And three dot And, and, and so on and so on.

49
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:13,490
And obviously the advantage of that is if,

50
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,050
if you have an app that starts misbehaving,

51
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:20,830
you can just kind of black hole those domains while the app manufacturer,

52
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:23,710
the vendor, I guess in this case sorts out the details.

53
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:28,880
Yeah, I mean, and, and that's one thing I find interesting is, you know, I don't,

54
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:30,679
at this point, I don't really care anymore,

55
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,289
whether or not it is an intentional attack.

56
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:36,509
The reality is the end result is that, you know,

57
00:02:36,619 --> 00:02:36,630
a

58
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:40,360
good portion of the internet was affected slightly.

59
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:44,059
Well, I think a lot of this too is we are approaching

60
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,800
just kind of the law of huge numbers

61
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:51,070
where it basically says when you have enough of something in this case,

62
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,600
it's crap on the internet, just like everything you can imagine

63
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,509
happens all the time.

64
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,360
And in this case, obviously with all the apps and all the people,

65
00:03:00,369 --> 00:03:04,190
with all the devices and the just constant connectivity,

66
00:03:04,649 --> 00:03:08,160
you're probably D OS someone all the time, right?

67
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:12,279
To some degree, I mean, you know, what gets me with these apps is,

68
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:16,669
you know, being able to like Pokemon uh that went from like,

69
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:19,520
basically what zero to like tens of millions of

70
00:03:19,529 --> 00:03:21,830
users in the span of something like days,

71
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:25,199
you know, and that's what gets me um

72
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,039
is not just the scale of these apps, right?

73
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,089
Like we're talking millions or tens of millions of users of these apps, you know,

74
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,919
basically, and these apps are running on, we call them phones, but really,

75
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:37,270
-- you know, they're in some cases, quad core machines with like what
-- eight

76
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:37,690
-- gigs of
-- ra m

77
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,720
what kind of crap phone do you have an

78
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:40,899
iphone?

79
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,160
But uh I think it's only dual core on the iphone

80
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,339
at

81
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:44,860
this

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,380
point. I don't

83
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:45,610
care.

84
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:45,869
It,

85
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,559
it'll run Nintendo, run, it'll run my

86
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:48,779
web browser.

87
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,960
So actually, we talked about Mario run, not Nintendo run.

88
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:57,289
Uh So we talked about Mario run, what, a couple, couple episodes ago and about the,

89
00:03:57,429 --> 00:04:01,270
we'll say uh scammers that were filling the gap

90
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:03,889
in the Android ecosystem because it's not released yet and

91
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:09,490
they put out, it's not an app, but it has like a button to say, register my interest.

92
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:13,169
And so now when Mario run comes out on Android,

93
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,540
it's going to, I, I don't know if it'll magically install it for me,

94
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:17,850
but it should at least tell me

95
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:18,608
and

96
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:24,089
well, it, it, it, it pains me to look at this and because why can't I have my,

97
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,230
my Mario game.

98
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:27,859
But more importantly is the fact that now when a normal

99
00:04:27,869 --> 00:04:30,970
person searches for Mario run in the Android app store,

100
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,549
they at least get something right.

101
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:33,630
This is kind of like

102
00:04:34,005 --> 00:04:37,475
I always come back to when I, when I deal with, you know, various people is,

103
00:04:37,725 --> 00:04:39,644
there's really three answers to every question.

104
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:44,614
There's yes, no and no answer and no answer. It's the worst answer. Right?

105
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,725
Even if you don't like getting a no, it's better than no answer.

106
00:04:47,734 --> 00:04:49,864
And that's kind of what I see here with this app.

107
00:04:50,274 --> 00:04:50,785
True.

108
00:04:50,954 --> 00:04:51,505
Yeah. It's funny.

109
00:04:51,515 --> 00:04:53,385
I was like looking for, um, uh,

110
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:56,125
I wanted to play Hearts of Iron Four on my machine and I was

111
00:04:56,135 --> 00:04:58,464
looking at the specs for Hearts of Iron Four and looking at my machine

112
00:04:58,739 --> 00:05:03,679
and this one site very helpfully said, download uh this dot exe and run it and we'll,

113
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:04,760
like, scan your hardware and

114
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,510
it runs or not. I was like,

115
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:07,000
no

116
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,829
delete that tab or close that tab out.

117
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,529
But, um, you know, most people, yeah, they just, they want to play their Mario game.

118
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,640
I mean, I know my six year old certainly does love that game.

119
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,760
Like, between that and Mario World creator. He is a happy, happy guy,

120
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:24,839
which, which I must say uh Mario maker is like the greatest game ever. Yeah,

121
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,000
but going back to the NTP abuse, I mean,

122
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,549
this is a significant problem because uh the, I mean,

123
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:31,950
the funny thing is the reality is for the

124
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:34,790
majority of these sort of iot and home devices,

125
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:36,940
realistically speaking, if their clocks go out,

126
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,149
it's not really going to matter all that much

127
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,549
because, you know,

128
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,940
uh industrial control systems running a power plant.

129
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,739
Yeah, that, that it will matter there.

130
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,750
-- But you know, they should be running their own NT
-- P time.

131
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:53,929
Question is why is the Snapchat app talking to an NTP server?

132
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,429
Shouldn't it be getting the time off of the device?

133
00:05:57,109 --> 00:05:58,929
Yes and no, because

134
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,579
can you trust the device time?

135
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:03,450
-- Can
-- you trust the NDP server time?

136
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:05,739
Probably more than the device?

137
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:07,019
Probably,

138
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:07,559
you

139
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:07,980
know, that

140
00:06:08,489 --> 00:06:12,940
um the other thing is uh I'm assuming Snapchat is doing maybe some cryptography,

141
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,609
which means, you know,

142
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:17,290
the times need to line up within a few seconds or tens of seconds

143
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:18,690
maybe. You know,

144
00:06:19,299 --> 00:06:22,209
because like I, I actually run into uh webex,

145
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,019
uh at least the Mao

146
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:23,399
uh

147
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,809
webex client

148
00:06:25,049 --> 00:06:28,899
uh wants to go talk to Google's DNS server 8.8 0.8 0.8.

149
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:32,589
I've heard of this before, which I think is totally the right thing to do

150
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,380
except I block all outgoing,

151
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,519
uh DNS and I filter it through my server which logs everything

152
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,519
because I want to log all my outgoing queries.

153
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:45,630
So that, you know, it's one nice thing is it makes it easy to block a domains.

154
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,679
And also I have like a traffic log. So,

155
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,660
you know, later on, if somebody says, oh, you know,

156
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:53,820
if you were talking to this DNS site that's command and control server for a Botnet,

157
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,640
uh I would be able to have that forensic log to check, you know.

158
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,239
Um And just, it's also curious, right?

159
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:00,799
Like, because there's,

160
00:07:00,809 --> 00:07:04,600
there's some web pages where you hit them and it generates 2 to 300 dns pages,

161
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,190
you know, it's, which is pretty kind of shocking.

162
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,149
Um

163
00:07:09,049 --> 00:07:10,839
So, you know, on the one hand, I mean, what,

164
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,720
what frustrates me is I would say for the general case,

165
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:16,309
having your app do its own time and its own DNS.

166
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:18,619
I mean, that's gonna cut your support costs.

167
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,359
It's gonna cut your hassles where people are like calling you and saying,

168
00:07:21,369 --> 00:07:22,170
why doesn't the app?

169
00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:22,519
You know,

170
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,450
it can't locate the server?

171
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:27,350
Why is that and it's like, well, because you have a broken network, I'm sorry.

172
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,970
But on the flip side, for the few people that do care, we,

173
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,790
we end up with these apps that do

174
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,130
you know, bad things, right?

175
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:38,730
That, you know, we have to poke holes in our firewall or our, you know,

176
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,899
security posture so that these,

177
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,179
you know, these apps work.

178
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,579
Now, I think that's a bit less of a problem with mobile apps because quite frankly,

179
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:46,309
you know, mobile apps,

180
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,160
the expectation is they run on a device

181
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,369
that is constantly moving around different networks,

182
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,660
wi fi cell networks, you know, whatever, right?

183
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,029
So for mobile endpoints might, you know,

184
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,079
uh this actually goes back to a Twitter thing where,

185
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:02,720
you know, these people were talking about um traffic inspection.

186
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,230
And quite frankly,

187
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:08,369
if your security posture relies on behaving like a state level attacker that is,

188
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,369
you know, decrypting tlsns cell and inspecting the content.

189
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,350
Um You're kind of doing it wrong because that

190
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,390
capability is rapidly going away, you know,

191
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,829
with everybody deploying perfect forward secrecy

192
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:24,190
and then deploying things like certificate pinning within apps, right?

193
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,579
Like Google Chrome does this where it'll still

194
00:08:26,859 --> 00:08:30,350
more trust uh an a uh certificate you import

195
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,099
than, you know, the regular root store.

196
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,780
But you know, as a user, I, I

197
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:39,219
don't want some company, even a company I work for installing, you know,

198
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:40,619
certificates on my device.

199
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,250
Would they allow them to inspect all my traffic, like,

200
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:46,809
unless it's a really high paying job in which case, then I would consider,

201
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:50,489
you know, what's funny is, it's actually gonna be the opposite of that is

202
00:08:50,609 --> 00:08:55,359
I think any reasonably senior individual is not going to

203
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:59,489
want to let the company kind of control their devices.

204
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:02,909
Whereas very entry level doesn't have a choice

205
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:03,989
because let's face it.

206
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,270
If you're senior, you can be like, heck, no, you're not touching my computer.

207
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,460
-- But if you're the entry level guy, like they're just gonna fire
-- you senior

208
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,280
level people that need it the most because like, you know,

209
00:09:12,289 --> 00:09:13,559
as the John put us to email that

210
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,869
shows like we.

211
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,830
So you know, here we, I think,

212
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,380
I don't know if we talked about this on the podcast

213
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,469
but remember I am now going to be moving to UTF

214
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:22,729
uh

215
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:23,599
authentication,

216
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,770
U two F, sorry, U two F authentication.

217
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,809
You know, my token should be arriving tomorrow

218
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:30,659
and I'm going to be deploying that because

219
00:09:30,789 --> 00:09:33,000
here's the reality I have, you know,

220
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:37,030
accounts with administrative privileges for some uh organizations

221
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:41,659
and one day I will be tired and stupid and I will click on the wrong link in an email.

222
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,270
Absolutely.

223
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,020
You even,

224
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:50,030
even experts are going to fall for this and actually U two F is better than just the,

225
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,409
the number you type in

226
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:52,739
because

227
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,219
if I if I'm a bad guy,

228
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,140
right?

229
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,820
I can man in the middle, the token code,

230
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:04,460
but I can't man in the middle U two F because it's got some magic built into it that

231
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:05,669
basically it actually

232
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,880
does crypto on the device, right?

233
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:10,330
It does crypto on the device and it basically the browser uses the

234
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:15,090
host name as part of the the I guess challenge response that happens.

235
00:10:15,469 --> 00:10:19,820
So if a bad guy has you going to, you know, like not google.com, then

236
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,799
your U two F token just isn't going to work, right?

237
00:10:22,969 --> 00:10:23,900
Which is awesome.

238
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:28,140
Yeah. And that's combined with uh I'm using uh what is it last pass or whatever?

239
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,059
And it has a browser plug in that

240
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:35,739
stores, passwords and remembers for them for me, but also ties them to the URL,

241
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,210
the domain name, right? So that I can't accidentally, you know,

242
00:10:39,669 --> 00:10:44,210
uh enter my Google password into. Yeah, totally legit google.com.

243
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:45,590
And I think

244
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,049
that's the reality, right? Like

245
00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:48,760
authentication credentials

246
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,479
have to be tied to the site that they are

247
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:53,000
dealing with.

248
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,599
And I, I think that's a reasonable requirement because the reality is right?

249
00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:00,000
People don't change their domain names very much because for one simple reason

250
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,010
-- you take a huge hit on your search engine
-- optimization.

251
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:07,289
People just don't, I mean, they don't change their passwords.

252
00:11:07,409 --> 00:11:08,609
I mean, let's face it.

253
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,049
Right.

254
00:11:10,729 --> 00:11:14,309
So, yeah, and I'm actually going to also be pushing for other

255
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,809
uh people within one of the organizations I deal with

256
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,630
to use UTF if they're like a senior person because,

257
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,200
you know, just the, the stuff they have access to, you,

258
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,979
get access to their account and

259
00:11:25,109 --> 00:11:25,890
see, here's what really,

260
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:26,049
I,

261
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:29,859
I realize what really worries me about a password sniffing attack for my

262
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:32,950
email and somebody getting into my password or into my email is that

263
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,739
they can now start going, uh,

264
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,000
and resetting passwords across all these other sites I use.

265
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:38,500
Yeah.

266
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,440
I mean, that's definitely the risk in that and,

267
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,760
and they'll steal the recipes my aunt has sent me.

268
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,250
Well, it's just the problem being right,

269
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,760
is most of these sites for their account recovery, like,

270
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:54,219
they don't have strong account recovery procedures and, and the majority of them

271
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,979
seem to boil down to type in your email address. Hit lost password.

272
00:11:57,989 --> 00:12:02,179
We'll email you a magic link, click the magic link, reset your password. That's it.

273
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,340
You don't need to know anything other than the person's

274
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,960
email address and obviously have access to their email.

275
00:12:06,969 --> 00:12:08,039
I wonder,

276
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:09,190
I, I've,

277
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,099
I've never tested this but I wonder if

278
00:12:11,109 --> 00:12:13,690
you change your password or not change your password

279
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:19,219
but lose your password on one of these U two F enabled sites if it demands the token

280
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:20,869
before it lets you change something

281
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:22,659
that I would not know

282
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:24,520
because the other reality is like, for example,

283
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:27,059
Google lets you print out account recovery codes,

284
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:31,739
right. Which I'm sure like a half of 1/10 of a millionth of a percent do.

285
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,250
Yeah, probably like, really? I mean, I know, I know, I know.

286
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,289
-- So,
-- yeah.

287
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,780
No, I'm, I'm, I'm basically, in the last week,

288
00:12:40,789 --> 00:12:44,369
I've realized I need to now adopt a security posture that is

289
00:12:44,979 --> 00:12:47,549
resilient enough to deal with me at three in the morning.

290
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,030
Right.

291
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:52,580
II, I can totally

292
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:52,979
remember.

293
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:53,609
It's,

294
00:12:53,969 --> 00:12:57,140
you know, that's that because that's going to happen someday. You know, like,

295
00:12:57,789 --> 00:12:58,539
um,

296
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:58,880
in

297
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:00,739
this, you sent me

298
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:00,849
a,

299
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,159
a little snippet

300
00:13:03,309 --> 00:13:04,940
when we were chatting earlier today,

301
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:11,179
was that the RS A talking about comprehensive training programs?

302
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,619
And it comes back to that.

303
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,349
I mean, we just talked about this a couple of episodes ago,

304
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:16,340
like you cannot patch people.

305
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:18,880
Even if you train them to death,

306
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:24,219
-- they're gonna screw it up.
-- Even, you know, even myself, I have received

307
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:29,700
-- legitimate emails that I've misidentified as phishing emails like
-- from Google,

308
00:13:29,789 --> 00:13:33,969
-- well, from Google, from my bank from
-- Amazon.

309
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:34,030
So

310
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,570
actually, you know what's really cool is my bank

311
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,369
does not send me email.

312
00:13:39,979 --> 00:13:40,349
They,

313
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:42,650
they, they have a,

314
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:47,369
they call it the secure messaging center when I log in to the website.

315
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,440
And

316
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,770
that's it. Like if there's a message that's where it is.

317
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,210
And occasionally I will get a mail from them that just

318
00:13:54,219 --> 00:13:57,330
says we have a message for you in the secure message center

319
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:00,840
and they don't even have a link to log in. They just say they have the message.

320
00:14:00,849 --> 00:14:03,179
So obviously I type everything in and I don't

321
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,059
have to worry about fishing and it's very,

322
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,770
-- that's
-- a perfect example.

323
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,159
Of one of the few things you can train

324
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:09,840
people to do that will actually make a difference,

325
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,299
which is the call back.

326
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:14,179
Hey, this is Bob from your bank. I'm calling you blah, blah, blah.

327
00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:19,429
Give us a call back. Click and then I call the number printed on the back of my card

328
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:25,609
or, or even better is I just go to the bank. I, I never call the bank. I don't trust it.

329
00:14:25,619 --> 00:14:27,630
So I go talk to a human being there and,

330
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:28,950
and I think one of the,

331
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:32,869
the, I forget the guy's name. Uh He, I think he thinks I'm crazy

332
00:14:32,969 --> 00:14:36,390
because I'm always in there asking him silly questions

333
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,280
and he's like, you know, you can just call us. I'm like, no, I won't call you.

334
00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:40,039
I don't trust it.

335
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:41,909
And then he looks at me funny and I'm like, just,

336
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,489
just go along with it like I'm crazy and I know it and everything's fine.

337
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:47,109
Well, you know, uh yeah, let's,

338
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:52,179
we'll save SS signal uh signaling protocol seven for a different episode or

339
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,989
sorry, signal protocols nine. Now, I think anyway,

340
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:57,969
it's the phone signaling system and we'll talk about some other podcasts.

341
00:14:57,979 --> 00:14:59,530
But coming back to this. So,

342
00:14:59,729 --> 00:15:03,369
yeah, with this, with this whole training people thing, I mean, the reality is,

343
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,590
I think the Callback is one of the few things

344
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:07,640
that's effective.

345
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,419
But the problem is you, you have to do it consistently and then, and you know,

346
00:15:10,429 --> 00:15:12,140
the remote end has to be available, right?

347
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,580
You never, no, it's never gonna work.

348
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:17,260
You can't even say that because let's face it, man. If I called

349
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:19,169
a grandmother today

350
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,890
and said I'm the bank,

351
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,140
do you think

352
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:25,080
they're not going to talk to you? They're lonely, right?

353
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,190
They want to talk to someone. I'm gonna talk to them.

354
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,020
That's why the Callback has to be trained because, you know,

355
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,820
the reality is like someday they're gonna get you.

356
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:32,580
Here's the deal. It can't be trained.

357
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,549
I'm I'm saying this,

358
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,140
-- it cannot be trained
-- because how do we deal

359
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,799
with people and phishing phone calls or phishing emails,

360
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,070
make sure that there is no way

361
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,559
using things like U two F tokens,

362
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,549
you make sure there is no way

363
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:49,190
that they can do what is being asked of them.

364
00:15:49,369 --> 00:15:50,359
Technically speaking.

365
00:15:50,369 --> 00:15:50,429
Now,

366
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,409
-- granted that is
-- not possible because there was a case

367
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,229
I was reading about and it's really kind of heartbreaking.

368
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,080
Um

369
00:15:56,239 --> 00:15:58,859
So these guys basically get lists of immigrants in the

370
00:15:58,869 --> 00:16:00,780
US for people who moved to the USA long time ago

371
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:02,619
and are like legal.

372
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:06,369
And so part of it is targeting the immigrant population because they're, you know,

373
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,520
they're immigrants or maybe their English isn't as good.

374
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:11,739
They're a bit more fearful of authority and you know, being deported and whatnot.

375
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:16,599
And this one lady got this call and, you know, they basically said you're gonna be

376
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:21,119
like your husband died, the paperwork got messed up. You need to send us like $2000 in

377
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,619
itunes gift cards

378
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,119
and the way they do it is you have to go,

379
00:16:25,469 --> 00:16:26,710
um you have to like,

380
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,239
you know, you basically go and buy itunes gift cards,

381
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,400
scratch them off and read the numbers back over the phone.

382
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:36,340
And so she actually went to her bank to get money and told them what was going on.

383
00:16:36,349 --> 00:16:38,770
And like the bank teller is pleading with her to not do this.

384
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,489
Like she's like, please don't do this.

385
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,200
Like, for the love of God, you know, this is, this cannot be,

386
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:46,969
you know, the IRS in the US and the uh what is it? The, um,

387
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,280
the depart, what's the Department of Immigration?

388
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:51,880
Is that under Department of Homeland Security or is it I,

389
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,059
I ce

390
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,179
immigration control whatever anyways,

391
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,520
the reality is they don't take payment and itunes gift cards,

392
00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:00,900
right. I'm pretty sure it's like

393
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,570
-- cash or check or maybe
-- wire

394
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,390
transfer. The IRS doesn't email people either.

395
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:07,089
Yeah.

396
00:17:07,098 --> 00:17:09,420
And that's one thing and, you know, as annoying as it is, I,

397
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,390
I actually agree with that.

398
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,459
I think a lot of government, like,

399
00:17:11,469 --> 00:17:13,500
especially every tax department on the planet

400
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,579
should probably just never email people.

401
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:19,108
Oh, totally. I agree completely. I think email is too insecure and crappy.

402
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:23,729
Well, it just, and it trains people to, you know, reply to these emails. But um,

403
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:24,430
yeah,

404
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:26,229
but so the problem is you have this human behavior

405
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:28,130
where you have like a person going into a bank

406
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,390
telling the bank what's going on the bank is clearly like, yeah, that's a scam,

407
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,819
don't, you know, don't.

408
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,810
And, but what, what are they going to do?

409
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:38,609
Like refuse service or like, you know, she'll go to a different branch and do this.

410
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:42,000
So if the scammer can get somebody that worked up in that, you know,

411
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,310
into that mindset,

412
00:17:43,849 --> 00:17:46,839
you know, there's literally no technological measure that

413
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,920
will fix that.

414
00:17:48,189 --> 00:17:51,959
-- But
-- OK, so here's the deal though is there's a difference between

415
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,319
willful ignorance

416
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,119
which

417
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:58,069
people get tricked and it's just an unfortunate reality and

418
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,319
that's been going on through all of human history.

419
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,150
I mean, that's what

420
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,459
right, seriously,

421
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:07,000
but there's also what I would call failures in our technology.

422
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,199
And this is where like I can click a link

423
00:18:09,469 --> 00:18:12,790
and it hacks my email or I click a link and it sends me

424
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,050
to a fake login page and I didn't type in my gmail credentials like

425
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:21,989
that is a solvable problem with technology like U two F OK?

426
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:23,939
Or, or just honestly,

427
00:18:23,949 --> 00:18:27,150
we need to fix the freaking browsers in a lot of instances I think.

428
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,310
But that's another story.

429
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,869
Well, more to the point, shouldn't I be, you know, I have this piece of software.

430
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,660
Well, two email client and a web browser. Um but claim

431
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:39,239
they can accept remote data and open it and display it to me safely.

432
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:41,310
Well, clearly they cannot, right.

433
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:41,869
And,

434
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,910
you know, we know that to be true now.

435
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,030
So,

436
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,500
I mean, this is why I don't use an email client anymore.

437
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,239
I use a web based, you know, email

438
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,599
because it's one less big piece of software to go horribly wrong.

439
00:18:52,949 --> 00:18:55,260
I agree with that. And I'm in the same boat.

440
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:55,750
Yeah.

441
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,920
-- And
-- so I, I only use Thunderbird with the GP G plug in so I can, you know,

442
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,079
do my encrypted email.

443
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:04,599
Did you know, I don't think I've ever used a fat email client in my life.

444
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:07,989
I think I jumped from terrible text based things into gmail.

445
00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:10,479
And I don't, there was really never anything in between.

446
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:16,949
I just, I never could deal with the fat clients. They were just too crappy for me.

447
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,449
I, well, so I came from,

448
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:22,949
I started out honestly doing email with something called Elm,

449
00:19:23,089 --> 00:19:25,949
which is about as old as it gets and then ironically,

450
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:30,670
oh, it gets better. And then I moved to N MH, which I became an upstream developer for.

451
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,290
Right. Which actually predates Elm, I believe as a male client.

452
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:33,979
-- But
-- it's

453
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:35,709
not like

454
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,209
it's no, it's not even painful. It's, it's like

455
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:44,209
you bought a pile of parts and you have to assemble them into something

456
00:19:44,459 --> 00:19:46,739
and in this case, it's an email client.

457
00:19:47,709 --> 00:19:52,609
It was. But the thing is after your like two years of getting it set up, it was awesome.

458
00:19:52,699 --> 00:19:53,260
Right.

459
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:54,829
And, and in fact, I even, I,

460
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:57,780
I added unicode support because it didn't have it at one point.

461
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:00,790
And I'm like, I can't read this like, you know, spam from China and,

462
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,989
and so that was my solution.

463
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,510
But anyway,

464
00:20:02,709 --> 00:20:07,400
that's fine when you're running your own, like pop, pop and IMAP server.

465
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,989
But then when I eventually moved all my services to gmail, it was just,

466
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,650
it sucked way too hard to use.

467
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:17,489
N mh with it and I'm like, screw it. I'm, I'm doing Gmail, you know, I'm all in now

468
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:18,729
and

469
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,430
I mean, there's days I miss it, but for the most part like it's ok.

470
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,449
I can deal with it.

471
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,439
Yeah.

472
00:20:24,719 --> 00:20:25,750
So, and,

473
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:29,510
but going back, so back, way back to the whole NTP conversation.

474
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,089
Part of the challenge is now is, you know, we have what we think of as phones,

475
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:35,319
but they're actually full computers and they have a lot of bandwidth.

476
00:20:35,329 --> 00:20:39,550
Like even though at my parents' cabin in the literally kind of the middle of nowhere,

477
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,630
it's a, you know, 57 cabin subdivision

478
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,989
and then the nearest town is like

479
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,839
25 30 minute drive away.

480
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:48,709
There's a cell phone tower across the lake and I can reliably

481
00:20:48,719 --> 00:20:51,829
get 30 megabits down and about 2 to 2.5 megabits up,

482
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,630
you know, and in the city it's funny because in the city,

483
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,109
I typically get slower speeds

484
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,569
um because there's more people in

485
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,229
here. Right?

486
00:20:58,689 --> 00:21:02,109
But the reality is, you know, my, my dirty little cell phone has, you know,

487
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:05,390
typically at a minimum one or two megabits of upload capability, which

488
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,319
you get a million cell phones doing that. And all of a sudden we're talking about,

489
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,750
you know, that's a terabyte per second.

490
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,180
Like that's a real, that's a big problem, you know.

491
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:16,619
And

492
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,380
one thing, uh, so a few weeks ago,

493
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,959
uh, cloud flare, uh, who's a big, uh,

494
00:21:22,969 --> 00:21:25,500
they're basically a big content delivery network provider.

495
00:21:26,229 --> 00:21:26,959
Um,

496
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,709
they started seeing these weird attacks that they called porcupine

497
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:32,239
attacks because essentially you have like your typical sort of cycle

498
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,760
cycle of traffic. You know, it ramps up during the day and drops during the night,

499
00:21:36,209 --> 00:21:40,290
but they're getting these weird spikes of traffic. Um, of what is it? Here we go.

500
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,369
500,000 to 1 million http requests per second

501
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,369
every 80 minutes.

502
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,869
And they've, they've written this huge long blog post,

503
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:53,319
uh analyzing the payload and, you know, somebody wrote to them and actually said,

504
00:21:53,329 --> 00:21:55,109
hey, I recognize the function that creates that payload.

505
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:56,510
It's this really little simple function,

506
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,150
but

507
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,719
they don't know what this is

508
00:21:58,979 --> 00:22:01,819
like. They don't know. Is it like a misbehaving piece of software?

509
00:22:01,829 --> 00:22:05,380
Is it somebody probing them, you know, attacking them to see what happens?

510
00:22:05,619 --> 00:22:07,910
Is it like, who knows what it is? Right.

511
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,060
And that's, that's kind of what really worries me is that,

512
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:13,180
you know, if it's just a flat out simple D

513
00:22:13,329 --> 00:22:15,359
OS attack against, say a gambling site, it's,

514
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:17,170
it's really clear what's going on there, right.

515
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,500
They want money otherwise, you know,

516
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,520
you can't take bets for Super Bowl Sunday or whatever.

517
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:24,300
But, you know, now we're seeing these massive attacks like the one that took down,

518
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,319
uh D DNS.

519
00:22:25,329 --> 00:22:26,310
Do we know why?

520
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,430
You know, is it a simple proof of concept and,

521
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:31,390
or testing of the bonnet or was it maybe testing DN

522
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,599
DNS to see what it takes to knock them offline?

523
00:22:33,609 --> 00:22:34,430
What's interesting to me?

524
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:38,369
So the way cloud flare deals with these attacks is they just scale massively, right?

525
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,150
They use what's called any cast. And so

526
00:22:40,689 --> 00:22:44,109
the idea behind the internet is, is you have an IP address for your computer

527
00:22:44,829 --> 00:22:49,069
and that IP address is, you know, basically broadcast by your ISP to other ISP.

528
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:50,209
So people know how to get to you.

529
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:56,079
And traditionally IP S had an IP address was attached to like one machine.

530
00:22:56,089 --> 00:22:57,459
It was lived in one location.

531
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:01,660
Now with any cast, what you can do is you can have a single IP address.

532
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:06,290
A great example being 8.8 0.8 0.8 you know, Google's DNS server and you can have it,

533
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,969
you can have multiple servers in multiple locations

534
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,890
broadcasting that I am 8.8 0.8 0.8.

535
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,709
Now the advantage of this is, for example,

536
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:16,439
you have servers in North America and servers in Europe.

537
00:23:17,469 --> 00:23:20,650
The people in Europe, go to the servers in Europe, the people in North America,

538
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,010
go to the servers in North America.

539
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,800
If the servers in North America tip over and die, then, well,

540
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,250
everybody goes to Europe.

541
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:27,359
Um

542
00:23:28,339 --> 00:23:31,989
And if you create enough of these, like in cloud flare's case,

543
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,819
it's more than 100 sites now with their servers,

544
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:35,800
you know,

545
00:23:36,069 --> 00:23:38,020
when, if you have say a

546
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:42,709
bunch of machines in say for the sake of argument, China

547
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:46,949
attacking cloud flare, you know, attacking their IP addresses,

548
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:48,510
they get routed to the Chinese service.

549
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,760
So they can only really impact the cloud flare.

550
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:54,439
You know, China Asia servers and the ones in North America are just like whatever.

551
00:23:54,449 --> 00:23:55,959
We don't see any of the traffic. We don't care

552
00:23:56,459 --> 00:23:59,560
the problem with that, of course, is not everybody can afford to deploy

553
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,959
servers in 100 different data centers

554
00:24:02,189 --> 00:24:03,640
with any cast, right?

555
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:07,739
So what worries me is not only do you get this like law of large numbers

556
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,839
where like let's face it if somebody attacks me with more than a gigabit of traffic,

557
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:13,760
I I'm done unless I hide behind somebody bigger

558
00:24:13,939 --> 00:24:17,010
like Amazon web services shield or cloud flare.

559
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:19,520
And what really worries me is we're now,

560
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:20,270
you know,

561
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:23,119
centralizing the internet quite a lot.

562
00:24:23,209 --> 00:24:25,050
Cloud flare has something like 30% of the

563
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,849
world's internet traffic going through it now,

564
00:24:27,219 --> 00:24:29,750
-- you know, between them and Amazon web services,
-- I guess,

565
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,189
-- I believe that it's
-- free and it protects you from the tax.

566
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:33,640
Well, it's,

567
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:36,599
I'm sure anyone running a reasonable size business

568
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:38,660
or website is not using the free stuff.

569
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:42,349
Uh, no, the, the pay stuff starts at like, 20 bucks a month. It's, which is

570
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,680
what you get is super awesome.

571
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,619
Yeah, for 200 bucks a month you get some really cool technology.

572
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,760
So it's totally affordable and like,

573
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:52,130
Amazon now is just rolling it into their default stuff.

574
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:52,229
Like,

575
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:55,119
if you use Amazon Cloud front and Amazon

576
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,880
wrote 53 you're automatically protected by their,

577
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,060
I think they call it shield,

578
00:24:59,430 --> 00:24:59,969
you know, their D

579
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:01,170
OS protection stuff,

580
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:04,130
you know, same thing with Google, right. They have Google has their,

581
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,930
you know, behind Google compute engine.

582
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,010
You know, they were talking about this and they, they just released a paper.

583
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,900
The uh what is it Google Infrastructure security design overview

584
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:13,719
and the long and the short of it is,

585
00:25:13,729 --> 00:25:19,189
is the way Google compute engine and all that stuff works for a tax.

586
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,189
Uh you know, denial of service tax is

587
00:25:21,489 --> 00:25:25,560
they just have crazy, crazy, crazy large amounts of bandwidth and servers,

588
00:25:26,869 --> 00:25:29,869
you know, so they can soak up a terabyte per second

589
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,449
because the reality is you can't deal with a

590
00:25:32,459 --> 00:25:34,430
terabyte per second attack in any other way.

591
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,979
Right. There's nothing clever you can do to like,

592
00:25:37,229 --> 00:25:40,819
-- block it unless it's coming from a single source, you know, which it's not going
-- to,

593
00:25:40,829 --> 00:25:42,140
it never does anymore.

594
00:25:42,469 --> 00:25:42,819
Yeah,

595
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:44,229
like I said, as a, you know,

596
00:25:44,239 --> 00:25:47,219
as a normal individual or even as a large organization you,

597
00:25:47,229 --> 00:25:50,140
you have to go hide behind an even bigger organization like Cloud

598
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:53,500
flare or Amazon web services or Google or Microsoft or whatever.

599
00:25:53,989 --> 00:25:54,579
Right.

600
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,650
Which is

601
00:25:55,939 --> 00:25:58,050
totally reasonable today.

602
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,969
I mean, you kind of think that, do you remember the, the slash dot effect?

603
00:26:01,709 --> 00:26:02,310
Yeah. Yeah.

604
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:05,130
I mean, we, well, we intentionally built our service to withstand it so we

605
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:06,020
traffic.

606
00:26:06,989 --> 00:26:10,380
But I mean, you think about that is that wasn't that long ago, maybe, what,

607
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:15,020
1015 years ago, if you had a popular website linked to you,

608
00:26:15,209 --> 00:26:16,140
it took you down

609
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:19,099
and these days I,

610
00:26:19,109 --> 00:26:23,310
it is rare to find a site that is down when

611
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:25,660
they get linked to obviously because of all this stuff,

612
00:26:25,729 --> 00:26:27,459
which is, which is super cool.

613
00:26:27,859 --> 00:26:30,219
Yeah, I guess this conversation could go one of two ways.

614
00:26:30,229 --> 00:26:32,739
Do we want to talk about security claims or do we

615
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:36,040
want to talk about maybe blocking all these IOT devices and

616
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:39,560
-- how they get the IOT
-- we talk about iot too much.

617
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:39,869
Yeah.

618
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:43,020
Well, I think the problem is the IOT is just, I,

619
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,920
I think what I realize now is what I don't like

620
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:47,300
about the IOT is it's not the internet of things.

621
00:26:47,329 --> 00:26:48,030
It's just

622
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:51,680
-- more stuff on the internet. It's the
-- internet. I know. I know exactly what you mean.

623
00:26:51,689 --> 00:26:54,150
It, it, it's the way it is and

624
00:26:54,439 --> 00:26:59,099
it's not even coming like it's here. This is the way things work now.

625
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:01,339
Welcome to the future, everybody.

626
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:02,660
Yeah. So,

627
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:03,060
but Yeah.

628
00:27:03,069 --> 00:27:06,689
So what's, what's really also interesting to me is that first cloud flare didn't

629
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:08,540
detect this attack because

630
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:11,900
the requests were essentially malformed a bit

631
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,780
enough so that they didn't get through

632
00:27:14,209 --> 00:27:15,119
and hit their, like, D

633
00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:18,089
dos protection system, they essentially were being, like, dropped as, like,

634
00:27:18,099 --> 00:27:19,540
just mangled traffic.

635
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:20,329
Um,

636
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:21,880
and so it wasn't until they started looking

637
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,619
into some other things that they detected this

638
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,079
and,

639
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:28,359
you know, that's what part of what gets me is. I remember when, um,

640
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:33,089
oh, what was the guy that was head of Yahoo security and left about a year ago, a

641
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,239
year ago.

642
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:38,459
Yeah, the guy that was in charge for about 23 years and then left because Yahoo was,

643
00:27:38,469 --> 00:27:41,569
-- like, spying on everybody's email and they didn't tell him
-- no, that was stamos.

644
00:27:41,969 --> 00:27:42,869
He was there for like, two

645
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:43,199
months.

646
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:44,890
I don't think

647
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,920
he wasn't there for years. He showed up.

648
00:27:47,349 --> 00:27:49,479
Maybe it was the guy before anyways or

649
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:49,760
I,

650
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,510
I just remember a quote from some Yahoo high level

651
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,680
security person basically saying when they went to Yahoo,

652
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:55,510
like,

653
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,140
what they were typically thought of as bad attacks and

654
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:00,660
everything was just like every other normal day at Yahoo.

655
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,589
Yeah. Right.

656
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:01,780
Well,

657
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:05,020
this is true of any of these large organizations and

658
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,829
I think people don't realize that all the time is

659
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,239
when you're the size of Amazon or Google or Yahoo or even cloud flare, no doubt,

660
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,650
sees this to a degree

661
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,489
is

662
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:20,319
you're getting attacked by every person in every country, every which way.

663
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:24,030
It, it's completely insane. The scale they have to operate at. I,

664
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,439
I was listening to an interview with a guy from Microsoft one time

665
00:28:27,589 --> 00:28:28,380
and he said,

666
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:31,329
you know, you're in a real data center

667
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:35,219
when you have to worry about physics being what's limiting you,

668
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:35,719
right?

669
00:28:35,729 --> 00:28:39,790
You think about that just because you have such a huge amount of data and like,

670
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:44,140
actually moving the electricity across the data center is a huge problem.

671
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,260
I mean, that's crazy.

672
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:46,479
Yeah, I know.

673
00:28:46,489 --> 00:28:49,520
And it's, I mean, on the one hand, it's lovely because for example,

674
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:55,260
you can build a website now that scales with use, you know, you pay by use and it can

675
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,579
be one hit or a billion hits,

676
00:28:57,969 --> 00:28:58,439
you know,

677
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,439
and you can do this starting for like,

678
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:04,180
-- tens of dollars a month.
-- Yeah. Well, it's super cheap. Although, although

679
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:06,719
you do need to be careful because if

680
00:29:06,729 --> 00:29:09,400
your website suddenly becomes denial of service,

681
00:29:09,709 --> 00:29:11,979
your bill could get very high, very quickly.

682
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:15,599
Well, I mean, most of these providers have ways to prevent that.

683
00:29:15,609 --> 00:29:18,790
Like, they can have alerts or they can just cut it off. You can set a limit. Like,

684
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:19,010
I only

685
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,280
-- spend this much
-- assuming

686
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,560
you set that up.

687
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:21,969
Right.

688
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:22,560
Yeah.

689
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:26,010
Well, and it's happened in the past and most of them seem to be willing to, you know,

690
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,119
cut some slack to these poor people because, you know,

691
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,199
it's kind of bad press when you

692
00:29:29,209 --> 00:29:32,000
bankrupt somebody because their website got attacked,

693
00:29:32,709 --> 00:29:33,250
you know,

694
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,640
or like that guy whose kid bought like a billion in game

695
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:40,290
items and ran up like a tens of thousands of dollars bill.

696
00:29:40,739 --> 00:29:41,540
Right. Right.

697
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:44,170
Which is always the best. That's why

698
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:47,670
some of my kids don't have a tablet account with a credit card.

699
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,189
Yeah. So,

700
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,160
but no, it's getting back to this. So,

701
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,750
the other problem too is,

702
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,119
is that this sort of large scale attack is is actually relatively

703
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,670
easy to pull off now because when you think about it,

704
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,880
right, like a popular, a

705
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:08,329
popular website or a popular app can tell a web browser, you know, go here,

706
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:08,989
get this thing,

707
00:30:09,859 --> 00:30:11,000
right? Um

708
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,939
And so let's say for the sake of argument,

709
00:30:12,949 --> 00:30:15,180
you run a really popular website with say

710
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,500
tens of thousands of people accessing it daily.

711
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:21,619
You know, if you include uh like, let's say, for the sake of simplicity,

712
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,689
you'll link to an image on somebody else's website

713
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:28,630
and tell it to display as like a one by one, you know, image. So nobody will notice it.

714
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,520
You now have tens of thousands of people

715
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,969
requesting this image from this other website,

716
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:34,199
you know, constantly.

717
00:30:34,729 --> 00:30:36,880
I believe that's actually the case with our podcast.

718
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,359
Oh, there there is,

719
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:41,920
there is somebody who grabs episode three of

720
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:45,160
our podcast every 15 minutes it is downloaded

721
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:48,880
and I assume it's just something is broken and it keeps pulling it in And so

722
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:53,719
it, it is comical when, when I look at these graphs and whatnot of, of data.

723
00:30:53,729 --> 00:30:56,310
But I'm also pleased that I don't have

724
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:59,079
to pay for every single individual download either,

725
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:00,760
which would be unfortunate in

726
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:02,099
this instance.

727
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:02,650
But yeah,

728
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:06,949
so episode three is the most downloaded episode of our podcast by a wide margin.

729
00:31:07,489 --> 00:31:09,030
Well, and here's a really good question.

730
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,270
Is there anything we could possibly do to deal with that?

731
00:31:12,449 --> 00:31:12,640
There's

732
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:12,979
something

733
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:17,829
if I really cared, I'm sure I could work with because Soundcloud hosts the data

734
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:18,670
and

735
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,430
they don't seem to care. I, I don't really care either

736
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:26,329
and whatever, you know, if, if, if I'd control over the server hosting the data,

737
00:31:26,339 --> 00:31:29,709
I could obviously find out right away and block them in some meaningful fashion.

738
00:31:29,719 --> 00:31:31,390
But, I mean, as such, I can't

739
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:35,079
and whatever, it's, if they don't care, I don't care. It's kind of the way I look at

740
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:35,329
it

741
00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:36,790
and this kind of

742
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,010
comes back to something I've been thinking for a long time is

743
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,439
I think a lot of these sort of security issues and problems,

744
00:31:41,449 --> 00:31:42,109
especially around

745
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,170
service attacks,

746
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,790
we should just engineer around them and ignore them

747
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,709
because quite frankly actually spending the time and money to chase them down

748
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,030
is going to cost a horrendous. It's like spam, right.

749
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,800
It's just cheaper to block it than it is to

750
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,780
find these people and prosecute them by and large,

751
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:01,609
which sucks. And I hate to say that. But that's just, it's, that's the reality of it.

752
00:32:01,829 --> 00:32:05,300
Yeah, it's totally the way it, it just, it is what it is. Right.

753
00:32:05,949 --> 00:32:06,489
I mean,

754
00:32:06,949 --> 00:32:11,089
it is the modern internet. This is how things work now and

755
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:16,290
I, I don't do other industries have this problem. I'm trying to think if there's,

756
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,079
yeah, I guess pollution.

757
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:20,859
Yeah.

758
00:32:20,869 --> 00:32:25,130
Well, or a great example being, you know, the whole fossil fuel industry in cycle.

759
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:25,650
Right.

760
00:32:26,089 --> 00:32:27,510
So, like,

761
00:32:27,609 --> 00:32:30,020
almost everybody is guilty to some degree of either

762
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,130
directly burning fossil fuels because they drive a car,

763
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,300
they heat their house with gas

764
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,530
or indirectly, right?

765
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:38,630
Because you consume plastic, you consume devices that were delivered to you.

766
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:38,849
Right?

767
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:42,949
So the reality is everybody is making lifestyle choices that involve at some point,

768
00:32:42,979 --> 00:32:45,650
almost certainly, you know, fossil fuels being burned.

769
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,099
You know, unless you, like go out and literally live naked in the middle of the woods

770
00:32:50,349 --> 00:32:51,609
even then

771
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:54,939
you're probably going to have to start a fire someday.

772
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:55,109
I

773
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,160
mean, this is true.

774
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:58,390
That's carbon

775
00:32:59,290 --> 00:32:59,369
dioxide.

776
00:32:59,959 --> 00:33:03,979
You could argue you're carbon neutral if you're burning trees,

777
00:33:03,989 --> 00:33:05,800
-- but
-- you have to plant a lot of trees.

778
00:33:06,239 --> 00:33:08,300
Well, and I guess this is not,

779
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,540
your analogy might be apt because you also think about if you are in industry

780
00:33:13,729 --> 00:33:14,630
and you, like,

781
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,819
like this happens all the time where a factory will

782
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:19,699
accidentally dump a bunch of something into the river,

783
00:33:20,089 --> 00:33:21,150
we just pay a fine.

784
00:33:21,469 --> 00:33:25,099
Yeah. No, it's, um, I think that's you know, part of the challenge is

785
00:33:25,859 --> 00:33:30,560
there's so much of this going on accidentally or otherwise intentionally that,

786
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:34,180
you know, actually tracking all of it down and, you know,

787
00:33:34,189 --> 00:33:37,359
prosecuting everybody or getting everybody to stop doing it would be,

788
00:33:37,369 --> 00:33:38,479
it's just invisible.

789
00:33:38,589 --> 00:33:39,599
Right. Exactly.

790
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:42,400
You know, it's, it's like law enforcement if, you know,

791
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:44,280
I mean, I, I,

792
00:33:44,329 --> 00:33:49,069
the thought of a society where every single law is actually enforced 100%.

793
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:49,170
that's

794
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:49,619
just it.

795
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:53,199
You know what? That's a really interesting thing to say because

796
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,859
you can't enforce all the laws 100% because, like,

797
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:59,979
80% of the laws in the books are crazy nonsense.

798
00:34:00,229 --> 00:34:04,020
Things. Like, you know, you can't carry an ice cream cone in your pocket or, or

799
00:34:04,189 --> 00:34:04,800
-- in the
-- US.

800
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:08,659
Um, due to the, the way some of the federal Wildlife Protection laws are set up,

801
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:12,889
something can be legal in your state, but it's still illegal federally.

802
00:34:13,129 --> 00:34:14,050
Well, that's, uh, the,

803
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:17,533
the whole marijuana legalization in these handful of states that have it.

804
00:34:17,543 --> 00:34:20,092
It is technically a federal crime but

805
00:34:20,283 --> 00:34:22,393
the states say it's legal,

806
00:34:22,404 --> 00:34:24,563
which really just means the state law enforcement has

807
00:34:24,572 --> 00:34:26,523
said we're not going to help the federal government

808
00:34:26,533 --> 00:34:28,592
enforce this and the federal government doesn't really have

809
00:34:28,603 --> 00:34:30,283
the resources to do a whole lot about it.

810
00:34:30,623 --> 00:34:31,404
And so,

811
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:36,280
in fact, it's created a bit of a mess for these companies selling this stuff because

812
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:40,918
their funds can be commandeered by the, the federal government

813
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:45,379
and so basically they're afraid to put money in the bank because the, the DEA can,

814
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:46,969
like, show up and take their money away.

815
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,708
And so what do you do? Right.

816
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:50,610
You keep it in a billow case.

817
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:51,489
Like,

818
00:34:51,728 --> 00:34:54,600
I mean, that, that's actually what they're doing. I mean, it's crazy.

819
00:34:54,938 --> 00:34:56,668
Well, maybe Bitcoin will save us all,

820
00:34:57,379 --> 00:35:01,280
-- or at least the marijuana industry.
-- Right. Bitcoin. Bitcoin will save us all.

821
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,219
Yeah.

822
00:35:02,979 --> 00:35:06,219
All right. What else we got here? I got, uh, did you hear a drone

823
00:35:06,449 --> 00:35:08,169
collided with an airplane?

824
00:35:08,879 --> 00:35:12,860
I'm surprised that hasn't happened sooner because, uh, one thing, you know, it,

825
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:14,620
it's one of these simple facts that

826
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,060
I never really thought of, but apparently a, a jet engine,

827
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,919
you know, they suck in

828
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:25,459
a huge amount of air, like, not just the little 3 ft cross section of the engine,

829
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,090
but they're, they're like, literally, it's a jet turbine.

830
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,189
So it's, you know, it sucks air in burns, fuel, spins the thing.

831
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:33,489
So it spins the front even faster to suck air in.

832
00:35:33,989 --> 00:35:35,889
And so these things suck in.

833
00:35:35,899 --> 00:35:39,820
Like I was reading somewhere like the, the, you know, the modern turbo bypass fans.

834
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:43,620
Like, anyways, the point is like, if you get within 100 ft of one of those things,

835
00:35:43,629 --> 00:35:45,129
like you're gonna have a bad day,

836
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,500
you know.

837
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:49,699
And so, because I was always kind of thinking, you know, it's,

838
00:35:49,709 --> 00:35:52,030
it's a good thing like planes are, you know, for their size,

839
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,300
they're relatively small

840
00:35:53,469 --> 00:35:54,830
and same with drones. Right.

841
00:35:55,189 --> 00:35:55,780
And so, you know,

842
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:59,300
the chances of a mid air collision or even if you're trying are probably not,

843
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:01,020
you know, it's not as easy as it looks.

844
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:01,500
Right.

845
00:36:02,209 --> 00:36:06,709
Um, but when you have a jet engine sucking in that much air and, you know,

846
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:09,590
like potential debris and stuff like a drone,

847
00:36:10,129 --> 00:36:10,969
yeah, all of a sudden it become.

848
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,280
So, here's the thing though, this drone,

849
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,909
it wasn't sucked into the,

850
00:36:17,129 --> 00:36:18,040
the plane,

851
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:22,760
the engine, it, it hit and if you look at the, the show notes will have a link to this.

852
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:25,179
There's a picture of the nose of the plane, like,

853
00:36:25,699 --> 00:36:26,709
basically,

854
00:36:26,889 --> 00:36:31,840
but at the same time this plane was on approach to land

855
00:36:32,169 --> 00:36:33,300
in Mozambique.

856
00:36:33,729 --> 00:36:34,360
And

857
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,000
I would bet you anything that when an airplane is landing

858
00:36:38,389 --> 00:36:43,260
it has the engine significantly throttled down as opposed to when they're actually

859
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:47,919
-- flying or even taking off
-- as I've learned from my airline disaster binge

860
00:36:48,189 --> 00:36:49,129
watch last month.

861
00:36:49,139 --> 00:36:50,290
Yeah, that's, that's why,

862
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:54,209
that's why accidents on landing are so dangerous because you just,

863
00:36:54,219 --> 00:36:55,770
you don't have the power to recover.

864
00:36:56,209 --> 00:36:57,010
I've heard that, you know,

865
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:01,449
and it takes a jet engine several seconds or tens of seconds to spool up and get power.

866
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,350
I believe that.

867
00:37:02,459 --> 00:37:04,770
So, if things go wrong and you're pointed at the ground.

868
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,810
Right. Right. Yeah, you've got problems. Definitely.

869
00:37:08,629 --> 00:37:11,010
Yeah, I mean, the good news is, planes are like,

870
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,439
if you've ever watched some of those structural failure tests.

871
00:37:13,449 --> 00:37:14,739
Boeing Posts, a few of these. It's

872
00:37:15,209 --> 00:37:15,290
amazing.

873
00:37:15,709 --> 00:37:18,330
Oh, they're like, they, they basically bend the wings and they're like,

874
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:21,969
here's where the wing is supposed to go, like the maximum amount

875
00:37:22,179 --> 00:37:23,530
and we're just going to keep bending.

876
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:27,810
Right. Well, you, you have to test it that way though. Or I've even seen

877
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,760
footage of airplanes where there have been like,

878
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:33,120
explosive decompression for some reason or another

879
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:36,250
and like half the plane is missing and the things

880
00:37:36,909 --> 00:37:37,469
I think it was

881
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:40,439
five, somewhere between like five and 10 rows of,

882
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:43,469
of like the length of the fuselage of the plane.

883
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:44,449
And it

884
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:44,889
was

885
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:49,409
crazy. I mean, but this is also why, like, keep your seatbelt on everybody because

886
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:52,719
you never know when you're gonna get sucked out of the airplane.

887
00:37:53,429 --> 00:37:55,040
But it's, yeah, it's crazy stuff.

888
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:58,610
I mean, they, they're built to such an amazing specification.

889
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,250
Well, they're big and expensive.

890
00:38:00,409 --> 00:38:00,949
That's true.

891
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:04,909
-- They cost like, what, 30 40 million bucks for a cheap one,
-- a lot more than that.

892
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:05,850
Really? Like,

893
00:38:06,189 --> 00:38:06,280
oh,

894
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:10,304
like, uh, try 1 to 200 million for like a modern 787,

895
00:38:10,794 --> 00:38:13,784
787 is special though, right. That's, that's a big,

896
00:38:13,895 --> 00:38:18,735
-- or a 747 or an Airbus, a 380.
-- Those are the huge planes though.

897
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:19,645
I mean, well,

898
00:38:19,655 --> 00:38:21,175
I shouldn't say those aren't the kind of

899
00:38:21,185 --> 00:38:23,344
planes I find myself in generally because I'm,

900
00:38:23,354 --> 00:38:25,864
I'm often not flying across the ocean or

901
00:38:26,175 --> 00:38:28,425
I wonder what I'll take when I go to Rs A.

902
00:38:28,735 --> 00:38:29,915
Well, I should look at that and see what kind of,

903
00:38:30,445 --> 00:38:31,135
-- uh, here
-- we go.

904
00:38:31,155 --> 00:38:35,675
The company lists the price of a 737 is between 51.5 million and 87 million.

905
00:38:35,685 --> 00:38:37,294
That's like a deal, man. Right.

906
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:41,919
That's, and that's a 737 which is basically like the, the school bus.

907
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,629
Yeah, that's what I'm in most of the time.

908
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:45,969
In fact that's what was in this, this collision here

909
00:38:46,229 --> 00:38:47,840
in Mozambique was a 737.

910
00:38:48,979 --> 00:38:51,270
I spend a lot of time in 737. Yeah,

911
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,830
they, I mean, they are nice plane. I, I do, I, I wanna go somewhere in a 787 though.

912
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,409
I've heard they're amazing airplanes and I've never had the joy of being in one.

913
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:03,850
However I was at, it was it, I was in Chicago. I think it was.

914
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,639
I, I forget what airport it was now.

915
00:39:05,949 --> 00:39:08,649
And I had my family with me actually because we're going on a trip

916
00:39:08,899 --> 00:39:09,489
and

917
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,330
here comes the

918
00:39:11,459 --> 00:39:15,409
Airbus a 380 which is like their Gigantor monolith. Right?

919
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,899
-- And
-- then
-- the double

920
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:17,429
decker one,

921
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,520
it's enormous.

922
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:23,159
And then behind it is a 787 like one after the other.

923
00:39:23,169 --> 00:39:23,600
I'm like,

924
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:26,659
look at that kids like those are the two biggest airplanes in the whole

925
00:39:26,669 --> 00:39:29,320
world and they're like playing their games on their phone and they don't care.

926
00:39:29,489 --> 00:39:31,919
But I was very impressed.

927
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:35,959
Yeah, I actually remember flying on 740 sevens as a kid to Europe and it was just,

928
00:39:35,969 --> 00:39:36,899
it was magic.

929
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:37,919
They're crazy man.

930
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,169
Well,

931
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:42,239
especially back in the day when they actually had some leg room and stuff and as a kid,

932
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,389
of course, everything was bigger.

933
00:39:43,449 --> 00:39:46,070
-- You know
-- what's really funny too? II I didn't know this but

934
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,830
so the 747

935
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:48,370
the,

936
00:39:48,379 --> 00:39:51,070
the front of the airplane can open up like kind

937
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,959
of a hatch where it opens to the other side.

938
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:58,550
And they did that because Boeing assumed that the Concorde was

939
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,300
going to be the dominant carrier of people across the ocean.

940
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:03,639
And the 747

941
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:07,750
wasn't going to be a practical airplane for moving humans for very long.

942
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,639
So they made it

943
00:40:08,889 --> 00:40:11,600
so it had a dual purpose of cargo or people

944
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,010
and obviously like the jokes on them people.

945
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,989
It's, it's interesting because I mean,

946
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,629
that's a classic example of we went from like literally

947
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:21,550
one or two miles an hour with the Wright Brothers.

948
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,550
Well, not one or two miles an hour but like, you know, below 20 miles an hour

949
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:25,540
to

950
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:29,500
supersonic speeds, you know, the, the bell X whatever

951
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:32,979
-- in the span of like, what was it like 50 years? Less than
-- 50

952
00:40:32,989 --> 00:40:33,330
years.

953
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:34,699
It was really,

954
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,719
it was just shortly after world war two.

955
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,050
And, but the problem is the economics,

956
00:40:40,459 --> 00:40:40,729
right?

957
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:44,760
When you start pushing something at the speed of sound, you eat fuel like crazy.

958
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:46,860
-- And also Sonic booms really
-- annoying

959
00:40:46,989 --> 00:40:47,010
to

960
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:49,000
people. No one cares about because you're flying over the ice.

961
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:49,179
I

962
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:49,969
mean,

963
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:50,580
they

964
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:54,459
-- do when you live near the airport or you forget how densely populated Britain
-- is

965
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:55,899
over the ocean,

966
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:56,419
Britain,

967
00:40:56,739 --> 00:40:58,340
whatever nobody cares about Britain.

968
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,439
But um

969
00:40:59,919 --> 00:41:03,030
yeah, so I mean, the, the reality is the economics of airplanes.

970
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,500
I mean, people have tried supersonic flight commercially

971
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,459
and it's just always been a failure and

972
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:11,580
now you're seeing more fuel efficient designs and things

973
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,810
that are like just at the speed of sound,

974
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,969
you know, so there's no sonic booms or different shapes.

975
00:41:16,219 --> 00:41:19,449
-- But yeah, it's just economically it's like,
-- and, and let's face it also,

976
00:41:19,459 --> 00:41:21,250
how many people going to Europe?

977
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,649
Is there a difference between three hours or seven hours?

978
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:27,820
Well, it's worse than that when you consider security and stuff now, right. Show up

979
00:41:28,729 --> 00:41:28,840
at the

980
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:29,399
airport

981
00:41:30,379 --> 00:41:32,409
and then on the back end you're like, at least, you know,

982
00:41:32,419 --> 00:41:33,770
especially with immigration,

983
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:38,439
especially if immigration's computers are down as we found out a week or two ago,

984
00:41:38,449 --> 00:41:39,709
like holy jeez.

985
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:41,820
I did you see that one video? Like people were posting?

986
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:44,040
So for those of you that don't know, don't know,

987
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:48,419
apparently like us immigrations like their whole computer system just died,

988
00:41:49,129 --> 00:41:49,479
right?

989
00:41:49,489 --> 00:41:51,330
And I haven't seen any details as to why or how,

990
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,219
but the whole thing just stopped working

991
00:41:53,879 --> 00:41:57,179
and yeah, so regardless, you know, the the lines were

992
00:41:57,699 --> 00:42:01,300
essentially the full airports full of people

993
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:02,179
and you know,

994
00:42:02,189 --> 00:42:05,699
people are posting videos of fist fights and stuff because it just got so insane.

995
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:06,889
Well, I, I

996
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:10,189
don't, can they even process people without, they

997
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:10,459
-- said
-- they

998
00:42:10,469 --> 00:42:11,979
-- were
-- manually processing people

999
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,469
so they can manually do it

1000
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:14,840
well, but

1001
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,780
they definitely can't look up your records without the computer.

1002
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:18,469
Uh,

1003
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:19,310
yeah,

1004
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,219
I wonder

1005
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:20,419
what

1006
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:22,530
the reality is with a lot of this stuff. Right.

1007
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:26,229
You, you know, you, you start talking to people like this is one thing I,

1008
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:30,340
I binge watched last year was, um, a combination of Australian border services,

1009
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:32,649
UK Border services, Canada Border Services

1010
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:35,250
and the US border services and, like,

1011
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,729
the, well, obviously the stuff they're posting on these TV shows, you know,

1012
00:42:38,739 --> 00:42:41,459
you kind of have that Survivor bias if they only post the good stuff.

1013
00:42:41,469 --> 00:42:44,750
But, like, some of these people were, like, clearly up to no good. Right.

1014
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,449
They're like, dancing around and sweating

1015
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,260
and it's like, yeah, we're a little suspicious because he, like,

1016
00:42:50,479 --> 00:42:52,620
you know, he's dancing and sweating or, you know,

1017
00:42:52,629 --> 00:42:54,889
the guy's talking a million miles an hour or

1018
00:42:55,209 --> 00:42:57,719
the guy is like, so obviously on drugs'.

1019
00:43:00,219 --> 00:43:02,290
My favorite is when they admit to carrying drugs.

1020
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,030
But they're like, no, no, no,

1021
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,389
it's ok because I'm on an international flight and I'm just transferring through

1022
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:07,550
and the Canada

1023
00:43:07,979 --> 00:43:10,760
border services guy are like, no, that's illegal here.

1024
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:13,030
And she, and, you know, this, this guy was like,

1025
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:15,850
but it's not illegal where I'm going and they're like, yeah, that,

1026
00:43:15,879 --> 00:43:17,209
that is technically true.

1027
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,850
But you're in Canada right now?

1028
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:21,250
Oh, great.

1029
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:24,590
There is actually, there was, there was an article

1030
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:27,850
I, I'll have to look for this but it was talking to a,

1031
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,659
one of the heads of security for one

1032
00:43:29,669 --> 00:43:32,399
of the Israeli airports and they were talking about

1033
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:35,310
because let's face it in Israel, they have like,

1034
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,360
real security concerns about their airports.

1035
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:39,949
It's not just a bunch of theater like this is the real deal

1036
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:40,790
and

1037
00:43:40,899 --> 00:43:43,129
the things they do are fascinating and, you know,

1038
00:43:43,139 --> 00:43:45,929
you mentioned a guy like dancing around and sweating and

1039
00:43:46,229 --> 00:43:47,310
what they're doing,

1040
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,729
like real security is very much so watching people

1041
00:43:50,739 --> 00:43:53,219
more so than anything else because I mean,

1042
00:43:53,229 --> 00:43:55,649
there have been tests done like the TS A in the United States and

1043
00:43:55,659 --> 00:43:58,679
they miss like 80% of the weapons that go through the X ray machine.

1044
00:43:58,689 --> 00:43:59,270
I mean, just

1045
00:43:59,729 --> 00:44:01,719
what you might as well not have.

1046
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:04,639
And it's a lot of it is, you know, you need to train people.

1047
00:44:04,649 --> 00:44:08,270
It's part of the problem is this requires real training of people.

1048
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:12,000
This is not like an afternoon course, this is weeks or months of training

1049
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,310
because a lot of it is

1050
00:44:13,489 --> 00:44:15,199
like small factual details.

1051
00:44:15,209 --> 00:44:17,860
Like, uh I remember reading one where they were talking about, you know,

1052
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:20,679
if you see winter coats in summer suicide bomber, right?

1053
00:44:20,689 --> 00:44:23,560
Big bulky coats, bad thing to have in, you know, Israel.

1054
00:44:23,899 --> 00:44:28,169
Uh and a lot of it too, was very sophisticated, you know,

1055
00:44:28,179 --> 00:44:29,429
putting the pieces together.

1056
00:44:29,439 --> 00:44:29,590
Right.

1057
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,320
Because you might notice three or four things but you have to put them together.

1058
00:44:32,919 --> 00:44:33,879
Exactly.

1059
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:35,379
And, and again, this is,

1060
00:44:35,489 --> 00:44:36,770
so, I guess this is funny, this,

1061
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:40,719
this comes back to the beginning of our conversation of, we were talking about

1062
00:44:40,979 --> 00:44:43,080
you can't train people

1063
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:44,399
to do security,

1064
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:45,350
which

1065
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:50,750
is true of normal people. But this is kind of the other side of that coin

1066
00:44:50,889 --> 00:44:53,070
where you're training personnel

1067
00:44:53,179 --> 00:44:56,709
to look for certain things to determine risk.

1068
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:00,389
And this obviously worked very well. But at the same time,

1069
00:45:00,659 --> 00:45:03,270
everyone can't be trained like this.

1070
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:07,070
-- Right.
-- Well, exactly. And I suspect that's why, for example, what was it?

1071
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,020
23 days ago, Amazon bought Harvest dot A I which

1072
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:12,250
from reading their website basically is a,

1073
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:14,770
it's a company that is building an A I engine

1074
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:20,090
that monitors access and use of computing resources, you know, access to files,

1075
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,489
editing them, blah, blah, blah.

1076
00:45:21,879 --> 00:45:25,370
-- And then based on those patterns says bad guy or normal person,
-- right?

1077
00:45:25,379 --> 00:45:25,929
Which I mean,

1078
00:45:25,939 --> 00:45:30,159
that totally makes sense though too because you look at the amount of data

1079
00:45:30,379 --> 00:45:32,949
that any organization is going to produce and you

1080
00:45:32,959 --> 00:45:34,810
don't even have to be a huge organization.

1081
00:45:35,469 --> 00:45:37,899
There's no way you can go through that data.

1082
00:45:37,909 --> 00:45:40,179
And I mean, I remember, I, I don't know anyway, currently,

1083
00:45:40,189 --> 00:45:42,040
but I remember people whose job was like

1084
00:45:42,149 --> 00:45:47,689
to go through the I DS logs and no human can do that because after 10 minutes

1085
00:45:47,969 --> 00:45:50,840
you're not reading anything anymore, you're just clicking next.

1086
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:51,929
Well,

1087
00:45:51,939 --> 00:45:54,459
it's funny you mention that because if you look at the

1088
00:45:54,469 --> 00:45:58,159
actual specifications for training around direct X ray machines and whatnot,

1089
00:45:58,389 --> 00:45:59,699
officially,

1090
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:00,570
they're not,

1091
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:03,939
you're not supposed to work more than 15 minutes because like the human brain just

1092
00:46:03,949 --> 00:46:08,129
can't do that kind of activity for more than 15 minutes without zoning up.

1093
00:46:08,139 --> 00:46:09,780
This also applies to a bunch of other,

1094
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:11,399
uh, security situations.

1095
00:46:11,409 --> 00:46:14,790
I remember they were also talking about for snipers, you know, like police snipers,

1096
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:17,110
they have to trade off every 15 minutes because you can't,

1097
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,699
you just can't stare at something for like, two hours

1098
00:46:19,929 --> 00:46:23,510
-- and be mindful and aware of what's going on really, you know,
-- computers,

1099
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,030
they love doing that kind of stuff.

1100
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:25,469
Right.

1101
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:26,199
-- Well,
-- yeah.

1102
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:27,300
And they're great, you know,

1103
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,310
they're great at it.

1104
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,479
And the other thing about the computers and this is what

1105
00:46:30,489 --> 00:46:32,750
always gets me when people talk about A I and automation,

1106
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,540
you can always make the computer better and once you've made it better,

1107
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:37,949
it stays better.

1108
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:40,580
The problem is you make humans better

1109
00:46:40,919 --> 00:46:44,320
and they either quit or they get a different job or they retire, you know,

1110
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:45,159
like they don't,

1111
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,209
you, you get one human better, awesome, good job for you. But

1112
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,209
unless that person becomes a trainer or something, you know,

1113
00:46:51,219 --> 00:46:53,679
that knowledge is effectively locked up in their head

1114
00:46:53,939 --> 00:46:57,439
and it's never shared and and apparently this is the reason now why, for example,

1115
00:46:57,449 --> 00:46:59,729
image recognition for A I has become such a,

1116
00:46:59,739 --> 00:47:03,310
a successful thing now is because there's all these training sets of data,

1117
00:47:03,649 --> 00:47:05,989
you know, there's all that existing pre-existing knowledge

1118
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:09,850
-- that you can just like scoop up for free or next to nothing now to use to train your A
-- I.

1119
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:13,949
Right. Right. Exactly. It's amazing what you can accomplish now.

1120
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:14,899
Yeah.

1121
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:18,310
And which, you know, I'm really curious about this arms race between.

1122
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:22,510
So, on the one hand, we have proof that you're a human to me because, you know,

1123
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,610
you're registering an account or whatever,

1124
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:25,750
you know, those capas

1125
00:47:25,969 --> 00:47:29,449
and like, uh, now the ones are like, what is it, like, pick all the pictures with,

1126
00:47:29,459 --> 00:47:31,120
like, pizza without fish on

1127
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:31,290
it

1128
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,060
or pick all the storefronts?

1129
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:35,239
And I'm looking, I'm like, is that a storefront or is that somebody's house?

1130
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:37,489
I don't know, like, it looks kind of like I've seen

1131
00:47:37,669 --> 00:47:38,620
like, there's this. Right.

1132
00:47:38,629 --> 00:47:40,449
I feel like I'm taking like a college aptitude

1133
00:47:40,459 --> 00:47:42,510
test where they're purposely trying to trick you.

1134
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,679
Exactly. And so, you know,

1135
00:47:45,469 --> 00:47:47,929
the problem is a, is, are going to get good at that.

1136
00:47:47,939 --> 00:47:50,050
Of course, they're going to be trained on this. So

1137
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:54,050
I, I'm actually kind of looking forward to this arms race between, like,

1138
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:56,570
prove to me that you are human.

1139
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,449
And

1140
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:00,530
-- the, of course, on the other side is like, I'm going to pretend to
-- be,

1141
00:48:00,659 --> 00:48:03,340
you know, what the answer is to this is, don't have

1142
00:48:03,479 --> 00:48:06,100
every freaking website have their own login system.

1143
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:09,320
Just use something like Facebook or Google to deal with the

1144
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:12,439
logins and then it becomes their problem to identify the human.

1145
00:48:12,449 --> 00:48:15,699
-- I'm totally serious.
-- I agree. No, no, I, I fully agree.

1146
00:48:15,709 --> 00:48:17,780
Um, at this point, I, yeah, I mean,

1147
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:19,540
Google is a great example because they require you to

1148
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:21,439
have a phone number that they send a code to

1149
00:48:21,669 --> 00:48:23,979
and that allows them to, for example, identify, you know,

1150
00:48:23,989 --> 00:48:28,040
cell phone providers that sell burner phones very easily or low cost, you know,

1151
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:29,020
prepaid or whatever.

1152
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:32,550
And then they know that those are higher risk accounts and, you know, shenanigans

1153
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:37,419
and let's face it, every organization is gonna have fake accounts. It's just

1154
00:48:37,919 --> 00:48:41,300
if you're a small company or a small group,

1155
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:45,149
you don't have the resources to actually deal with that problem and things like,

1156
00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:47,979
I mean, cap just basically don't work today, let's face it.

1157
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:51,310
I hate them because I, I'm actually getting to the point now where,

1158
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,419
especially with the mangled letters and

1159
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:55,929
stuff and having to hit refresh two or three times.

1160
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:57,090
I,

1161
00:48:57,219 --> 00:48:59,850
I can't even imagine what it must be like for

1162
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:02,010
somebody who's 70 or 80 or who has bad eyesight.

1163
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:05,080
I bet the A is, are better than people at the stupid things now.

1164
00:49:05,469 --> 00:49:06,570
Oh, probably

1165
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:08,010
I would

1166
00:49:08,139 --> 00:49:08,179
hope,

1167
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:11,689
you know, they're a human because they can't figure it out. Right.

1168
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:12,280
Yeah.

1169
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:15,600
Well, and that's kind of what I'm wondering is, you know, prove you're not a machine,

1170
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:17,209
you know, say something uniquely human.

1171
00:49:17,459 --> 00:49:18,129
Right? Yeah.

1172
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,489
Let me into the damn website. All right, you're a person.

1173
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:22,389
Yeah.

1174
00:49:22,979 --> 00:49:26,370
It's kind of like those when you call up the, the uh Robo.

1175
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:28,070
Uh what, what is that?

1176
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:31,169
The Robo call center thing where your call is important to us, you know,

1177
00:49:31,459 --> 00:49:33,129
the menu may have changed but, and you, like,

1178
00:49:33,139 --> 00:49:35,949
you start swearing at it and it transfers you to a person immediately

1179
00:49:36,179 --> 00:49:38,409
like that basically works. Just, just so

1180
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:39,840
anyway.

1181
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:44,469
Yeah. So, no, it's, it's a brave new world and I mean, that's,

1182
00:49:44,929 --> 00:49:45,929
you know, what's interesting.

1183
00:49:45,939 --> 00:49:49,530
I wonder what else this law of large numbers is going to affect? Right.

1184
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:51,719
Because there's, there's a lot of these things happening,

1185
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:53,959
it affects everything.

1186
00:49:54,639 --> 00:49:55,540
Yeah, because that's,

1187
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:58,820
that's the other reason I had to turn off antivirus on my desktop was

1188
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:01,659
I have over a million files on my desktop. Apparently

1189
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,580
-- I run Linux. So I don't think I have an antivirus. I can run. Yeah.
-- So I do

1190
00:50:06,699 --> 00:50:09,409
occasionally run like an antivirus scan of my backups,

1191
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:14,570
but to run a full antivirus scan on my desktop now takes like an hour or two, you know,

1192
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:16,110
and it's just, and it never detects anything.

1193
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,899
Of course, that's the best part. Right. It never finds anything.

1194
00:50:19,409 --> 00:50:19,899
Yeah.

1195
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,580
Right. Right. Well, in,

1196
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:24,939
you know, man, so here's part of the deal too is I,

1197
00:50:25,239 --> 00:50:27,750
I have family members will say that

1198
00:50:27,909 --> 00:50:30,719
have antivirus software and they always have viruses

1199
00:50:31,129 --> 00:50:32,189
and every time I see them,

1200
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:36,110
I have to fix their computer and we'll put fix in air quotes here because it's

1201
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:39,750
really just run the antivirus software and then click delete.

1202
00:50:39,989 --> 00:50:41,510
And that's pretty much all I can do.

1203
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,169
I don't understand why those things give you an option.

1204
00:50:43,429 --> 00:50:45,189
I don't know, whatever it doesn't matter.

1205
00:50:45,489 --> 00:50:46,520
But then, like,

1206
00:50:46,689 --> 00:50:48,979
I, I don't want to sound like some, like,

1207
00:50:49,429 --> 00:50:52,169
pretentious a hole here, but I have never

1208
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:53,870
downloaded a virus

1209
00:50:53,979 --> 00:50:56,250
because I don't click on dodgy links.

1210
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:01,649
I don't do stupid things for and I'm not saying I'm immune mind you. I'm just saying

1211
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:05,810
that these people have this technology and it clearly doesn't work.

1212
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:10,870
And, you know, even, even though I may have antivirus running on a system,

1213
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:15,459
I'm still not, I, it's not a problem because I'm not doing crazy things.

1214
00:51:15,469 --> 00:51:16,610
Now, my kids on the other hand,

1215
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,689
scare the crap out of me because they're always looking for like,

1216
00:51:18,939 --> 00:51:19,399
you know,

1217
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:22,149
dodgy, Minecraft mods or things.

1218
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:26,320
And it's like here download this exe and I'm like, no, don't do that stuff.

1219
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:30,179
This is honestly why I haven't let my kids near a quote

1220
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,189
unquote real computer.

1221
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:32,169
It'll be

1222
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,000
ipods and ipads for the foreseeable

1223
00:51:34,399 --> 00:51:35,750
-- future.
-- You're gonna crack some day

1224
00:51:37,149 --> 00:51:38,110
someday. Kurt,

1225
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:41,120
-- it'll happen.
-- I'll give him a Linux box that'll show

1226
00:51:41,149 --> 00:51:41,179
him.

1227
00:51:41,659 --> 00:51:41,850
Uh,

1228
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:45,030
that's, yeah. Well, well, for what it's worth though.

1229
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:47,350
So this is actually part of it too, is like with Minecraft,

1230
00:51:47,699 --> 00:51:48,610
my son

1231
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:50,179
found a book

1232
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:53,239
and I think it was at the school library talking about Minecraft mods.

1233
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:57,090
And he says, oh, look, here's a program I can download that will

1234
00:51:57,270 --> 00:52:01,370
install mods for me. And I look at it and I'm like, this is actually cool

1235
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:05,800
because you have basically like a company now that's managing the mods

1236
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:08,879
for him and he clicks on them and they install themselves.

1237
00:52:08,889 --> 00:52:10,979
So he's not going to these dodgy websites.

1238
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:13,250
It's really, no.

1239
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:14,290
Can you please

1240
00:52:14,449 --> 00:52:14,739
send me that?

1241
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:15,709
Yes,

1242
00:52:15,939 --> 00:52:16,189
I will. I

1243
00:52:16,699 --> 00:52:17,020
put it in the show.

1244
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:17,870
I,

1245
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:19,120
there's a lot of parents no

1246
00:52:19,419 --> 00:52:19,709
serious. That's why

1247
00:52:20,389 --> 00:52:20,659
that is,

1248
00:52:21,189 --> 00:52:24,139
that is 95% of the use case for a laptop for my one. So

1249
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:28,739
-- will be Minecraft with
-- mods on, on its own private Wi Fi network.

1250
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:30,850
So nothing else will ever see it.

1251
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:33,300
Yeah. Yeah, I'll look for it. I'll look for it.

1252
00:52:33,899 --> 00:52:38,300
All right, man. I think we've wasted enough time for our dear listeners.

1253
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:42,149
So, yeah, if anybody else has any good Minecraft links to stuff that will make it

1254
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,590
easier for a six year old.

1255
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:45,590
We're moving on from

1256
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:48,729
now. We'll talk about Minecraft and nothing else.

1257
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:49,830
-- We
-- should do

1258
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:50,030
a

1259
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:50,540
show.

1260
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:53,649
I love Minecraft. Oh, my goodness. You have no idea how many like you talk

1261
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:54,239
about your

1262
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:59,439
machine. My chicken, the chicken cooker is, is fantastic. I have several and

1263
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:01,969
not only that will actually, my, my real claim to fame is,

1264
00:53:01,979 --> 00:53:03,790
have you ever heard of something called Sky Block?

1265
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,719
So it's where you basically start out with this

1266
00:53:06,729 --> 00:53:09,580
like extremely minimalist world that basically has like no,

1267
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:10,280
nothing in it.

1268
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:14,719
It's you're on this little teeny tiny, like nine by nine patch of land with a tree.

1269
00:53:15,219 --> 00:53:15,800
And

1270
00:53:16,149 --> 00:53:18,750
I have an enormous world I have built and

1271
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:22,199
I have a village which means to make villagers.

1272
00:53:22,209 --> 00:53:24,570
I had to create zombies

1273
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:28,409
and then wait for a zombie Villager, heal the zombie Villager.

1274
00:53:28,419 --> 00:53:31,850
And I needed more than one. And then I had to have them kind of do their thing

1275
00:53:31,979 --> 00:53:33,080
and multiply

1276
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:35,050
and I have an enormous village now.

1277
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:36,120
Yeah, it's,

1278
00:53:36,419 --> 00:53:39,870
you have become a God. I, I have too much freaking free time.

1279
00:53:39,879 --> 00:53:41,370
Actually, I haven't played it in a long time there.

1280
00:53:41,379 --> 00:53:44,479
There's a period of time where I found myself home.

1281
00:53:44,489 --> 00:53:46,600
I would put my kids to bed and I had like an hour or two

1282
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:49,320
at night waiting for my wife to come home. And

1283
00:53:49,469 --> 00:53:51,310
then I, I had time

1284
00:53:51,449 --> 00:53:55,959
to do that. Like that's what I did is I played Sky Block for like six months and it was,

1285
00:53:56,419 --> 00:53:58,070
I don't know, it's clearly

1286
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:02,360
I have nothing to show for that six months of my life. The time I spent in the,

1287
00:54:02,659 --> 00:54:05,560
except this crazy sky black world. Anyway. Anyway. All right, folks,

1288
00:54:05,739 --> 00:54:07,090
you can go to

1289
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:09,050
open source security podcast.com.

1290
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,449
We love all the show notes to all the things we've talked about.

1291
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:14,560
You can hit us up on Twitter, there's Pound

1292
00:54:14,669 --> 00:54:16,330
Os S podcast

1293
00:54:16,629 --> 00:54:18,810
and there's of course a link to that on the show notes

1294
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:23,199
and you can find Kurt and I send us messages, whatever, we'll certainly respond.

1295
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:24,110
I also,

1296
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,139
I'm gonna try something new is I put together a

1297
00:54:26,149 --> 00:54:29,719
Facebook group for open source security podcasts and there's gonna be

1298
00:54:29,729 --> 00:54:31,479
a link to it in the show notes and we'll see

1299
00:54:31,489 --> 00:54:33,959
if that's maybe something people are interested in or not.

1300
00:54:33,969 --> 00:54:35,649
Either way we'll see, we'll give it a chance

1301
00:54:36,129 --> 00:54:36,669
and

1302
00:54:36,919 --> 00:54:41,080
I have nothing else exciting to say. We've got Rs A coming in a couple weeks.

1303
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:42,939
We should probably talk about that at some point.

1304
00:54:42,949 --> 00:54:43,199
Kurt,

1305
00:54:43,209 --> 00:54:46,510
because we'll both be there and maybe we'll do something special for the podcast if,

1306
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,870
if nothing else, you know, come find us and, and, and hang out or say hi or whatever.

1307
00:54:49,879 --> 00:54:50,169
But,

1308
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:53,350
yeah, I guess, uh, you have a fantastic day, Kurt.

1309
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,909
Thank you for listening, everybody. And until next time.
