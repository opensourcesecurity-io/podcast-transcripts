Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself.

1
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:13,039
Kurt Siefried and my partner and old timey radio shenanigans. Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:13,489 --> 00:00:13,710
Yeah.

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,930
Well, it's not very old timey. I mean, all the topic, all the things you pasted.

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,149
We are old. Well, we're old

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:26,489
but all of the radio based stories you put into the show notes are not old at all.

6
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:30,250
-- Uh, Tetra is old,
-- sadly it's still in use.

7
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,619
-- But
-- what else are you going to replace it with? Like,

8
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:33,860
-- nothing,
-- you know,

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,130
and it's a good, it's a good,

10
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:36,799
so it's

11
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:41,369
ok. What is Tetra? Tetra is terrestrial trunked radio? So

12
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:45,150
fun fact, if you want to send a radio signal 100 kilometers,

13
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,549
right. It's expensive and difficult

14
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,549
nowadays, 20 years ago, like, you better have a car to haul that thing

15
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:52,909
is impossible.

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,619
So, the idea was

17
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,630
what if we basically have something that's kind

18
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,750
of like a cell phone but longer range,

19
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:02,590
lower quality and can also like locally mesh up well, like a radio.

20
00:01:02,599 --> 00:01:05,580
So basically the way it works is you have a pretty standard radio.

21
00:01:05,589 --> 00:01:06,680
But locally, you know,

22
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,989
if you're in the next room you can hear me or a block over whatever.

23
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,120
And if I kind of want to make like, a longer call to control or whatever, well, I just,

24
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:15,269
it trunks

25
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,040
to a terrestrial station

26
00:01:17,589 --> 00:01:20,900
and then I can, you know, go talk to my boss who's sitting in some other city.

27
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:22,519
It's not just for that though.

28
00:01:22,529 --> 00:01:26,019
It's also lets, like, the fire department talk to the police department,

29
00:01:26,029 --> 00:01:28,900
even though they have completely distinct radio systems,

30
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:32,059
it allows them to interoperate by essentially like

31
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,779
whatever system I'm using

32
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,379
talks to the same ground station that whatever system you're using,

33
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:37,750
talks to the ground station,

34
00:01:38,029 --> 00:01:38,190
that's

35
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:42,389
essentially it's a reinvention of a network of networks

36
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,660
also known as. Right. Well, no, but seriously,

37
00:01:46,029 --> 00:01:47,889
so Tetras a good system and of course,

38
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,930
it had encryption because you don't want people listening to the policemen and

39
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,709
all that.

40
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:54,809
And of course, that encryption was

41
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,050
private and hidden and it turns out to have probably not been very good. Like,

42
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:00,989
who knew?

43
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,449
-- I know. Right. I'm so shocked
-- that secret encryption

44
00:02:04,779 --> 00:02:05,650
is bad.

45
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:09,169
Yeah. So, and in line with that though, we also have the GPS thing.

46
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,559
So apparently GPS around Iran is being jammed and,

47
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,130
or spoofed and they've almost want like

48
00:02:15,339 --> 00:02:17,369
-- boof
-- mostly it sounds like.

49
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,929
Well. Ok. So,

50
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,339
all right, I'm going to admit to a felony. I own a GPS jammer.

51
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,169
I bought one off of a rather dodgy

52
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:27,210
Hong Kong website a long time ago.

53
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:29,119
And what was fascinating? Ok.

54
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:32,199
So what's fascinating to me about GPS is that it works because

55
00:02:32,649 --> 00:02:33,309
it is

56
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,270
barely above the noise floor.

57
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,050
The like galactic radio

58
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,449
-- signal echo from the Big Bang. Basically the
-- cosmic microwave background,

59
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:43,740
the

60
00:02:43,869 --> 00:02:45,729
cosmic microwave background that like those guys that

61
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,330
bell ran into when they were trying to,

62
00:02:47,339 --> 00:02:47,630
you know,

63
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,389
make stuff work.

64
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:53,289
It's the pigeon poop. Oh, wait, no, it's a Nobel Prize.

65
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,369
-- It's a fine
-- line,

66
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,270
but an important one.

67
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:00,399
So what gets me is like, yeah, I mean, because these satellites are

68
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,669
not big and it's not like they have some giant like nuclear reactor on them to,

69
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:06,050
you know, crank up the radio

70
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,220
power on the transmitter.

71
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,830
So like the radio transmitter on those things is like, it's not strong.

72
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:13,649
And so the fact that,

73
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,490
you know, thanks to the magic of digital signals processing,

74
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,009
we can actually pick out those signals and like, tell you where you are

75
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,210
to within a high degree of accuracy. So

76
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:26,610
I tried out my GPS jammer on a couple of different GPS things I owned back in the day.

77
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:27,699
Ok. And

78
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,679
some failed the way I expected them to,

79
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,139
which is they lost the GPS lock and just kind of went

80
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:34,520
and like

81
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:34,880
I

82
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:35,470
would,

83
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:38,500
but that's not how all of them failed.

84
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:42,130
One of them started drifting sideways at over 1000 kilometers an hour.

85
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:43,339
Oh, that seems normal.

86
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,229
-- Right.
-- And I was like, what now? Huh?

87
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:48,820
And it like, literally, I it was totally 100% reproducible.

88
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,740
I would turn it on and it would sort of get confused and then it would just start,

89
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:52,750
it would just go

90
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,770
like a, like a plane and I'm like, ok, that was, that's weird.

91
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:58,979
So, the thing is when, when you say

92
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,000
I, I

93
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:03,149
don't know that it needs to be GPS, spoofing,

94
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,360
GPS jamming could result because here's the reality.

95
00:04:06,369 --> 00:04:10,220
Have we ever really, truly extensively tested this and published the results?

96
00:04:10,339 --> 00:04:10,839
No,

97
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,630
I mean, probably not.

98
00:04:13,059 --> 00:04:15,869
Well, for one thing, it's, you know, you gotta get like a special,

99
00:04:15,929 --> 00:04:17,950
all sorts of licensing from the SEC to do this in

100
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,529
the US which like the US Navy does all the time,

101
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:19,670
right?

102
00:04:19,678 --> 00:04:19,959
Like

103
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,108
they send out those no dams

104
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,410
airman saying like GPS in the San Francisco region will be like kind of

105
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,779
screwed up for a few days because the US Navy is doing something.

106
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:27,850
It's a

107
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,339
thing.

108
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:30,220
So,

109
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:34,899
and then related to that is Apple is apparently there's rumors

110
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,440
like the kind that get reported on slash dot

111
00:04:37,739 --> 00:04:41,019
About them putting an in house cellular modem

112
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,709
on their like system on a chip.

113
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:44,679
I mean,

114
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:45,630
yeah,

115
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,690
that doesn't, they already have

116
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,809
like cellular modems in the iphone

117
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:54,940
and ipads, for example. So I don't feel like this is a, is a huge stretch.

118
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,570
The one thing though, they buy them from Qualcomm today

119
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,779
where they're talking about building it themselves.

120
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,730
They've been talking about for like a decade now

121
00:05:01,739 --> 00:05:04,130
-- and still haven't done what's
-- fascinating to me is

122
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,799
I love to find my iphone

123
00:05:07,109 --> 00:05:09,309
and stuff. Ecosystem. Right. Like we have

124
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:11,010
a collar that holds a little air tag.

125
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,600
So when he disappears under the deck you can find.

126
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,140
Right.

127
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,390
You know, I love that. I can,

128
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,869
where's my ipad?

129
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,179
And I can make it ping. I can know exactly where it is.

130
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,799
Same with my son's, you know, phone, we left it once at a mcdonald's,

131
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:24,119
it fell out of his pocket and I know exactly where to go to get it.

132
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,179
And it would be nice to have that level

133
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,850
of accuracy with my laptops because they're not cheap.

134
00:05:28,859 --> 00:05:29,269
I mean,

135
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:35,000
would, would, having a cellular modem in it necessarily accomplish that though.

136
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:35,709
Well, yeah.

137
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:37,720
Right. Because it would have better.

138
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:40,049
The thing you're forgetting is it's not about the location,

139
00:05:40,369 --> 00:05:44,000
-- it's about working when the device is turned off.
-- I mean, that's all apple magic.

140
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,630
I don't, I mean, that doesn't necessarily mean they'd support that though.

141
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,149
You're taking a huge leap.

142
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:50,779
I suspect they would because that's kind of one of

143
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,190
the big use cases because how often have people?

144
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,250
Have we heard those stories of, like, my iphone was stolen?

145
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,109
And I'm like, hey, policeman, it's right over here.

146
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:00,109
Like, can we go up, can you go get my phone back and arrest these people,

147
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:02,089
like those people who put air tags in their luggage?

148
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:02,649
Right. And, like,

149
00:06:02,964 --> 00:06:04,625
lead the person, you know, or the,

150
00:06:05,595 --> 00:06:08,285
I love the people who put air tags and things and then, like,

151
00:06:08,295 --> 00:06:12,144
they mail it or it's in their luggage or whatever and then they track it as it travels.

152
00:06:12,154 --> 00:06:13,945
Like the world. It's so amusing.

153
00:06:14,204 --> 00:06:15,095
It's so good. Ok.

154
00:06:15,105 --> 00:06:19,214
Anyway, how are we going to tie all of this together from a security context?

155
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:22,625
What's fascinating to me is it's, we now live in a world

156
00:06:22,894 --> 00:06:25,505
where I can affordably stick

157
00:06:26,054 --> 00:06:30,584
a small computer system on a chip with a baseband modem

158
00:06:30,929 --> 00:06:33,299
that runs at a low enough power.

159
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,230
But when the device is off, making air quotes here off,

160
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:40,589
it is still communicating with the cell network and

161
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,429
telling it where it is and what's going on

162
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:47,589
and it's drawing a low enough amount of battery that it, that's fine.

163
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,589
It doesn't really matter.

164
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:49,250
And

165
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,829
I think this has some really interesting

166
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,660
implications because like, one thing I've always wondered about, like,

167
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,589
for example,

168
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:55,510
my sister

169
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,149
and her husband bought a car from Germany and had it shipped over here

170
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,630
and it got lost

171
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,570
elastic. I'm like,

172
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,989
well, they didn't lose it,

173
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:07,109
lose it. It's, it's like my luggage. Like we didn't lose your luggage.

174
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:08,589
We just don't know where it is.

175
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,790
Right? And it'll pop up in a few days or weeks and it did, right.

176
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,109
The car eventually popped out of the system.

177
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:15,989
But I'm like,

178
00:07:16,109 --> 00:07:16,760
man, I'm like,

179
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:22,230
that's an expensive item that might be like I can track my pizza in real time.

180
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:26,450
Why can't we track this asset. That's like

181
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:27,850
almost six figures.

182
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:29,670
I,

183
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:33,519
because like my cell phone does it, my ipad does it,

184
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,170
my laptop sort of does it. But like my car,

185
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,760
I have an airtag in my car. And actually,

186
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,040
it was funny because the San Francisco Police

187
00:07:41,049 --> 00:07:43,140
Department just stated that you should put an

188
00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:45,440
air tank in your car to track your car when it gets stolen because like,

189
00:07:45,609 --> 00:07:46,519
we don't really care.

190
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,040
But in fairness it's easier and faster

191
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:49,679
because

192
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:51,980
we even work in a parking garage underground because

193
00:07:51,989 --> 00:07:54,149
as long as somebody walks by it with an iphone

194
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:56,880
it'll later ping off the system and

195
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:58,029
there's my car.

196
00:07:58,799 --> 00:08:00,010
I mean. Right. Ok.

197
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:02,429
I want to reframe this in a different way.

198
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,859
I think that it, I'm gonna hope is more interesting

199
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:08,160
and it's all radio related, right?

200
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,480
Radio even, I think a decade ago or more

201
00:08:12,739 --> 00:08:13,769
was this

202
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,359
magic thing

203
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,119
that was out of the realm of

204
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:21,320
access and usability by nearly every person.

205
00:08:21,329 --> 00:08:24,024
Yeah, we had cell phones but it still wasn't near what it is today.

206
00:08:24,035 --> 00:08:25,654
Like, freaking everything has a wireless chip.

207
00:08:25,665 --> 00:08:25,975
Now,

208
00:08:25,984 --> 00:08:28,184
there's a guy with a Christmas house decoration by my

209
00:08:28,195 --> 00:08:31,565
kids school and he broadcast music on 105 point whatever.

210
00:08:31,704 --> 00:08:34,275
And I was like, did you have to get a license for that? Like, are you a ham guy?

211
00:08:34,284 --> 00:08:36,885
And he's like, no, it's low enough power that I can just do it. Yeah.

212
00:08:36,895 --> 00:08:39,085
-- Yeah,
-- that's, that's always been like that you could,

213
00:08:39,275 --> 00:08:42,174
you could buy actually. Do you remember back in the day

214
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:45,914
-- when F
-- M Bluetooth to FM transmitter for your car?

215
00:08:45,924 --> 00:08:47,575
-- No, no,
-- no, no, no, no, not even that.

216
00:08:47,705 --> 00:08:50,075
So back in the nineties

217
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,599
there were,

218
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:55,590
let's say you had a CD, a walkman or a disc, man,

219
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:58,599
I guess they were for people who don't know, this is a portable CD player.

220
00:08:58,609 --> 00:09:01,710
-- You could bring places because that was a big deal.
-- 10 seconds of anti

221
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,419
skip technology.

222
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:05,320
If you were lucky, you had 10 seconds of anti skip,

223
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,309
which I'm not even going to explain, go look it up.

224
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:08,750
But anyway,

225
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,469
there was the tape.

226
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:13,989
If, if you were lucky enough to have a car with a cassette tape player,

227
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,289
you could get those weird tapes on the wire thing, you'd stick in the tape player,

228
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:21,489
plug it into your CD player and then you could listen to C DS in your car,

229
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,349
which is magic.

230
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,719
Now, if you didn't have a tape player in your car, as I did not,

231
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:30,789
you could buy a transmitter from Radioshack that would transmit,

232
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:33,900
you plugged the transmitter into the CD player and

233
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:35,289
then you had to put the transmitter very,

234
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:37,219
very, very close to the car antenna

235
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:39,280
which was like in the corner of you.

236
00:09:39,385 --> 00:09:42,924
Obviously, back in these days, we had a literal antenna on the, on the car,

237
00:09:43,054 --> 00:09:45,575
you'd occasionally drive past somebody and you'd hear like,

238
00:09:46,054 --> 00:09:46,534
because it,

239
00:09:46,664 --> 00:09:47,784
they also had one

240
00:09:48,604 --> 00:09:49,344
but anyway, so,

241
00:09:49,354 --> 00:09:52,284
like those transmitters have been around for a long time and granted,

242
00:09:52,294 --> 00:09:55,585
they were terrible in the nineties and didn't work very well.

243
00:09:55,645 --> 00:09:56,005
But

244
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:57,320
the, the point is

245
00:09:57,619 --> 00:09:59,880
if we look at where we are today, right,

246
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:04,169
we have the ability to take something like flipper, zero, the flipper zero, the,

247
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:07,219
the tetra look, cracking tetra a decade ago,

248
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,640
out of the question. Even if you knew the algorithm was crap. Yeah.

249
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,599
-- there's like no way you could have done it,
-- right.

250
00:10:12,849 --> 00:10:15,890
The thing is you need a software to find radio just a hard,

251
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,280
it's like having a network sniffer probe thing

252
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,760
like 20 years ago. That was,

253
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:22,950
-- that was just completely magical,
-- not just that

254
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,510
you can buy a freaking

255
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,320
TV tuner

256
00:10:27,469 --> 00:10:29,890
that is a USB adapter for the,

257
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,400
these things are like you can get them

258
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:33,890
for literally $20 and they're very functional,

259
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,450
not as good as the expensive ones.

260
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,679
And you have a software defined radio and

261
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,599
you can sniff an enormous amount of radio spectrum

262
00:10:40,729 --> 00:10:47,039
just with that stuff, right? It is absolutely amazing. The concept of jamming gps.

263
00:10:47,609 --> 00:10:48,559
And here's the thing,

264
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,369
they're jamming gps near Iran.

265
00:10:51,739 --> 00:10:55,729
It could literally be a Rando doing this now, right.

266
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:59,890
Potentially a decade ago, it would have unquestionably been

267
00:11:00,219 --> 00:11:05,169
a nation state doing it because no one else had that resource. Now anyone could do it.

268
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,210
It

269
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:06,580
is mind

270
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,489
boggling and amazing.

271
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,484
Well, but what's also interesting to me is Iran should know of all the people,

272
00:11:12,494 --> 00:11:15,645
you know, that GPS guided drones are a potential hazard,

273
00:11:15,945 --> 00:11:19,044
probably what they've been selling them to Russia.

274
00:11:19,465 --> 00:11:22,914
You know, and, and apparently, like, around the Crimean area and everything, like,

275
00:11:22,924 --> 00:11:26,255
there's pretty near constant on off GPS jamming

276
00:11:26,265 --> 00:11:27,885
from the Russians and the Ukrainians because,

277
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:29,034
yeah,

278
00:11:29,284 --> 00:11:30,455
because I was thinking about it.

279
00:11:30,585 --> 00:11:31,974
How do you know where you are?

280
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:35,260
Right. There's a couple of ways to figure it out. Why you look around.

281
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,229
Well, yeah, you look around for and that's how the,

282
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:40,200
that's how the original Tomahawk cruise missiles worked right

283
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:40,890
there.

284
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,109
Well, they didn't have GPS, my friend,

285
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,549
they had terrain guidance mapping

286
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,219
and

287
00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:47,979
that's why they didn't work in the,

288
00:11:47,989 --> 00:11:50,700
in the first Gulf War is because they were built for like Europe

289
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,549
where you had hills and churches and other landlords to look at,

290
00:11:54,989 --> 00:11:56,760
which works fine in western Europe.

291
00:11:57,109 --> 00:11:59,919
Right. There's lots of churches everywhere. They're pretty distinctive

292
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:04,799
-- and in the desert, not so much in the
-- desert, the sand dunes move around.

293
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:05,960
You can't like

294
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:10,039
a dune here today isn't going to be there in a week. It's gonna move,

295
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:10,640
which is

296
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:11,429
so

297
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,179
you can look for where you are and that can work. If you have landmarks.

298
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,500
Like if you're standing next to the Eiffel Tower,

299
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,239
-- you're probably next to the
-- Eiffel Tower.

300
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,320
You can see it wherever you

301
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,219
-- in the city. It's marvelous
-- number two,

302
00:12:21,369 --> 00:12:24,250
inertial reference. So you can know where you started.

303
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,080
I took four paces forwards, two to the left,

304
00:12:27,309 --> 00:12:29,349
three north. And you should know where you are.

305
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:32,179
-- I
-- mean, yeah, the good old fashioned gyroscope navigation. Right.

306
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:33,179
And there's like,

307
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,989
nist has a thing where they want to get those down to a cubic centimeter with a,

308
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,510
you know, circular of probability of X and Y.

309
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:41,820
Well, things like submarines and stuff that you just can't,

310
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,500
you're just going to the freaking moon, like.

311
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:46,750
Yeah.

312
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,369
Right. So, what's the third way?

313
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,440
Well, the third way is something like GPS where,

314
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,770
which is a form of looking around where you are.

315
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,450
Really?

316
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:56,559
Yeah, that's fair.

317
00:12:56,869 --> 00:12:57,210
That's fair.

318
00:12:57,369 --> 00:12:58,059
But you're just,

319
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,289
you're able to see something that you can't see because it's transmitting,

320
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:02,260
it's broadcasting.

321
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,739
But as we've covered, you know, the radio signal, not very strong.

322
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,820
And so

323
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,919
what gets me is how critical GPS is for everything?

324
00:13:10,929 --> 00:13:14,820
Like you want your pizza, that guy better have GPS or he's gonna get lost.

325
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,460
Well, I think all,

326
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,619
actually, it's funny

327
00:13:17,732 --> 00:13:20,872
you say that because I was talking to one of my kids the other day and they were like,

328
00:13:20,882 --> 00:13:24,153
how did people deliver pizzas before you had GPS?

329
00:13:24,163 --> 00:13:24,293
They,

330
00:13:25,593 --> 00:13:26,572
they had a map,

331
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,732
they had a map on the wall

332
00:13:28,913 --> 00:13:32,672
and they would figure out where they had to go. It was nuts. But anyway,

333
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,653
I, I don't think it's just GPS.

334
00:13:34,663 --> 00:13:38,232
So, Kurt, you look at all of this radio technology that exists and it, it,

335
00:13:38,432 --> 00:13:39,552
it fuels the model

336
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:40,546
world now.

337
00:13:41,015 --> 00:13:42,585
I mean, you think the,

338
00:13:42,776 --> 00:13:44,486
what the internet did

339
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:48,346
to all of us a decade ago is what wireless is starting to

340
00:13:48,356 --> 00:13:52,786
do to us now where we have access to enormous amounts of location,

341
00:13:52,796 --> 00:13:54,406
information and data

342
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,616
and literally anything we could want

343
00:13:56,776 --> 00:14:01,286
-- all the time and it's become normal
-- and even simpler things. I mean, I,

344
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,229
I don't think I've seen a security system now

345
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:06,049
that's wired anymore because

346
00:14:06,789 --> 00:14:08,580
like, wires are expensive and hard to run,

347
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:09,650
you know,

348
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,010
and I actually just got a notification. My front doorbell needs new batteries

349
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,479
but, or, uh,

350
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:16,520
yeah, the front door lock, not the doorbell,

351
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,809
the doorbell is actually wired up to the 12 volt circuit.

352
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,729
So I just, I really wish I could do that for my front door lock because it, every,

353
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:24,539
every month or two, especially in winter when it's cold,

354
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:25,640
the batteries just instant death

355
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,309
batteries don't like the cold.

356
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,919
-- That's kind of how it works.
-- But what gets me is that it actually works,

357
00:14:31,489 --> 00:14:33,539
right. Like, we had some issues.

358
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,539
We, I hadn't and nobody had ever thought to rebalance the,

359
00:14:36,549 --> 00:14:38,979
the Wi Fi channels at the CS A office

360
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:42,570
-- and they were having some minor,
-- nobody. It's your job.

361
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,380
-- Like I'm
-- remote, I just assumed one of them was doing it.

362
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:49,380
So anyways, but what's funny is as bad as it was,

363
00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:51,390
it was only noticeable because it would, like,

364
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,570
glitch during a video conference for like 1/10 of a second.

365
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,010
And that was the worst fail of it. And of course,

366
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,809
that as actually is unacceptable because like,

367
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,799
it's really not great to try and be presenting and be glitching,

368
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,640
rebalance the channels and it basically went away

369
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,299
and, you know, in the long term, we'll probably move to, um, well,

370
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:14,559
we'll move to the Wi Fi 66 gigahertz

371
00:15:15,609 --> 00:15:18,940
once we have people with devices that can actually use it

372
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:22,010
because right now it's all 2023 and later Mac devices.

373
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:22,890
-- So
-- it's
-- like

374
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:27,280
it's really good. Actually, it's scary good when you use Wi

375
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,609
-- Fi six,
-- I have Wi

376
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,830
Fi 62.4 and five gigahertz here.

377
00:15:31,969 --> 00:15:34,440
And the slow spots are now 100 megabits per second.

378
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:35,400
Uh Yeah,

379
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:40,190
-- and the fast spots are 600. Uh
-- you go way above that with

380
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:40,869
the,

381
00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:45,280
I don't have any client devices that are new enough to do six gigahertz.

382
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:49,239
-- I
-- am, you know, funny enough, the laptop I use right here that runs Linux

383
00:15:49,809 --> 00:15:51,030
has Wi Fi six

384
00:15:51,525 --> 00:15:53,895
-- but I only, it only works when I run windows.
-- So Wi

385
00:15:54,034 --> 00:15:57,065
-- Fi six or Wi Fi six with 66
-- with six gigahertz.

386
00:15:57,075 --> 00:16:00,184
-- Like it's got the real deal on it and it's amazing
-- because that's a confusing thing,

387
00:16:00,195 --> 00:16:00,364
right?

388
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,015
Is every time I'm like, I'm dealing with Wi Fi six, I'm like,

389
00:16:03,025 --> 00:16:05,794
I have to check the spec sheet because Unify, for example,

390
00:16:05,804 --> 00:16:08,525
makes a PS that are Wi Fi six but not six gigahertz.

391
00:16:09,244 --> 00:16:10,275
Yeah. Yeah. No, No, it's,

392
00:16:10,445 --> 00:16:11,434
-- anyway,
-- anyway,

393
00:16:11,445 --> 00:16:14,575
I'm looking forward to it because I have stucco on the outside of my house.

394
00:16:14,864 --> 00:16:17,364
What does stucco get mounted on a metal mesh

395
00:16:17,684 --> 00:16:18,715
if you're lucky?

396
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,909
So, I have a metal mesh surrounding my house.

397
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:21,559
It's

398
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:22,020
a,

399
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:22,520
prior

400
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:22,840
to wi

401
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,090
fi

402
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:27,020
65 gigahertz. My backyard was like three megabits. Now. It's like 100.

403
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:28,520
But, um,

404
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,599
yeah, it's, I,

405
00:16:29,609 --> 00:16:31,460
I am looking forward to six gigahertz because

406
00:16:31,469 --> 00:16:33,140
it should apparently just go through that,

407
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:33,450
like

408
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:36,270
a hot knife through butter. It's a good question. I don't know.

409
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:36,989
So,

410
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,270
anyway, the smaller the, the, the, the,

411
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,150
the higher the frequency of the transmission,

412
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:43,630
the more stuff it kind of punches through, like, look at x rays

413
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,349
-- because it's higher energy.
-- It's

414
00:16:45,869 --> 00:16:46,549
anyway. All right,

415
00:16:46,849 --> 00:16:46,859
a

416
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,299
broad rule of thumb.

417
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:49,690
That's fair. That's fair.

418
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,380
It's,

419
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,219
yeah, I know. It's complicated. But as a generalist

420
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,250
-- for the purposes of getting a good signal in my backyard, it's true.
-- Ok. That's fair.

421
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,349
That's fair. It's very close.

422
00:16:58,359 --> 00:17:00,219
-- It, it should work well
-- and, and funnily enough,

423
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:03,940
that's actually one of the big benefits also of using six gigahertz and stuff.

424
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,300
And the beam steering is that

425
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:08,959
you then instead of broadcasting in a 360 degree

426
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,020
space, y

427
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,660
your beam steering,

428
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:13,780
your beam steering and

429
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:14,750
you actually

430
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:14,920
do

431
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:19,699
transmit less and broadcast less. And so there's less pollution of the spectrum

432
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:20,540
can

433
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,219
-- use
-- it.

434
00:17:21,868 --> 00:17:22,780
Let's hope so.

435
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,358
Yeah.

436
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,618
Yeah, probably we'll see. I don't know.

437
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,459
We'll see, the devices are still spewing garbage in all directions. But

438
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:30,760
anyway,

439
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,280
-- well, that's true. The clients are, but
-- the

440
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:38,430
access points are, are, are more powerful. I don't know. Anyway. All right.

441
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:40,599
-- Well, the access
-- points have a better antenna because they're bigger.

442
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:41,640
Well, obviously,

443
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,280
ok,

444
00:17:42,489 --> 00:17:46,920
so I want us to get back to all the security and all of this race

445
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,060
and everything.

446
00:17:48,469 --> 00:17:49,670
I love that.

447
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:53,099
Here's the thing. How do you prevent data exfiltration

448
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:57,369
if every system has a built in broadband modem that you can't turn off?

449
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,219
I mean, and so that's actually one of the many concerns, right?

450
00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:03,979
And this is very, very true of like any computer today

451
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,739
because every computer has Wi Fi built into it. Right?

452
00:18:08,329 --> 00:18:12,800
-- And so you just have to assume if an attacker
-- but you can sort of turn it off.

453
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:16,140
It's all software though, right? You can't turn a lot of this stuff off.

454
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:19,780
-- But,
-- I mean, with the base band chips as we've discovered in cell phones,

455
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,839
you, it's on even if the device is turned off

456
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,959
-- in,
-- in, in many instances. Yes.

457
00:18:24,969 --> 00:18:29,400
And I think this is where from an intelligence agency perspective, this is a huge

458
00:18:29,979 --> 00:18:31,930
conversation and concern, I think.

459
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,560
Right? For like you and I,

460
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,790
whatever, like my computers are always connected to the internet.

461
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,209
So it's not like a huge concern I have and let's face it.

462
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:41,689
If someone with those capabilities is after me,

463
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:45,569
I have no hope. Right. This is the classic. Massad versus not Massad argument.

464
00:18:45,579 --> 00:18:47,130
I would hope they would just cut you a check for free

465
00:18:47,214 --> 00:18:50,694
50 grand rather than spending the 50 grand covertly entering your house.

466
00:18:50,814 --> 00:18:53,395
Why would they cut me a check for 50 grand?

467
00:18:53,505 --> 00:18:55,954
Well, because, you know, then they also can blackmail you.

468
00:18:55,964 --> 00:18:58,155
It's going to take more than 50 grand to blackmail me. Kurt.

469
00:18:58,214 --> 00:19:01,625
-- How many bags of cheesy would it take?
-- I don't know. We'll see, we'll see.

470
00:19:01,635 --> 00:19:04,395
Actually, you know what's funny is I ordered some off Amazon.

471
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:07,160
Yeah, I can buy cheesy off Amazon.

472
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,989
They sell, I mean, you can buy everything off Amazon but

473
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:10,989
they're expensive. But I don't,

474
00:19:11,699 --> 00:19:14,739
I mean, it was the same price I paid at the Vancouver airport at that time

475
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,420
but,

476
00:19:15,709 --> 00:19:18,030
and then I bought them and then my family ate almost all of them.

477
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,250
I need to start selling cheeses with Amazon. Wow,

478
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:22,209
that

479
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:22,329
is,

480
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:26,989
I mean, I don't know, I don't know what they're supposed to cost

481
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:30,540
a 420 g package for $18.

482
00:19:30,859 --> 00:19:32,949
That is not what I'm paying at Costco.

483
00:19:33,449 --> 00:19:35,449
I mean, they sell them at Costco. I'm

484
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,900
so jealous. Where do you think I buy them?

485
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:37,170
I

486
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:37,410
don't

487
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:37,920
know that

488
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:38,589
I get that

489
00:19:38,829 --> 00:19:41,949
-- giant bag with all the little tiny bags because I
-- want, yeah, that's the one I got.

490
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:44,459
-- I got the giant bag with all the little tiny bag.
-- What did you pay

491
00:19:44,469 --> 00:19:44,839
for it?

492
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,040
I paid $45 for that.

493
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:51,310
Uh, I'm gonna say like, I think 17,

494
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,530
what? Holy crap. That's cheap

495
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:54,589
corn

496
00:19:54,689 --> 00:19:55,989
meal and cheddar.

497
00:19:56,189 --> 00:19:56,250
But

498
00:19:57,369 --> 00:20:00,229
no, it's not just that cheesy are the best thing ever.

499
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:02,630
And if they weren't, I wouldn't pay $45 for junk food.

500
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:07,420
So, uh, sorry, um, uh, 36 by 36 g is $26.

501
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:10,760
$26. That's Canadian dollars and

502
00:20:10,979 --> 00:20:11,239
it's like

503
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:11,979
18,

504
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,900
that's like $2.54. So

505
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,469
anyway, I wish.

506
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:20,599
But yeah, no Costco sells the giant bag with the 36 little

507
00:20:20,739 --> 00:20:20,770
bag,

508
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:21,199
which is

509
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,390
so they stay fresher

510
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,760
because once you open that bag of cheesy,

511
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:25,209
they actually do go stay.

512
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,780
That's not my problem. My problem is I will eat all of the cheesy,

513
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,829
regardless of the size of the bag I open.

514
00:20:31,089 --> 00:20:31,530
That's how ches

515
00:20:31,739 --> 00:20:35,150
work. So if I eat a small bag, I don't eat a lot of cheesy. I open the big bag.

516
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,410
I eat a lot of cheesy and I'm like, oh,

517
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,160
I wish I hadn't eaten them all and then I go look for more cheesy.

518
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:39,439
But

519
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,140
anyway, anyway, ok,

520
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,660
I want to talk about

521
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:48,150
security of radio and just all this stuff and, and tie it all up. Right.

522
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,300
-- I'm
-- not
-- even sure.

523
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:53,930
Like I'm, we're at a point where, for example, from the CS A office

524
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,510
there are over four or 500

525
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:58,859
other Wi Fi clients and

526
00:20:59,199 --> 00:21:02,349
-- a PS visible.
-- That's fine though. Who cares? We, we've solved Wi

527
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:02,719
Fi

528
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,329
But my point is

529
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,859
if I'm looking for a covert transmitter,

530
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,089
how do I look for a covert transmitter

531
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,739
when there's 500 things shouting

532
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:12,569
within

533
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,890
two blocks of the office?

534
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:19,380
I mean, look, you could do it if you needed to and you had the right gear like ham radio.

535
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,869
People have had this ability for literally decades.

536
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,209
Well, there's actually apps for android and stuff now,

537
00:21:24,219 --> 00:21:26,560
that kind of replicate it to a degree, maybe

538
00:21:26,829 --> 00:21:26,989
not bad.

539
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:27,729
Well,

540
00:21:27,969 --> 00:21:31,300
you don't get as much directionality but you do get the signal strength and stuff.

541
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:32,209
Sure, sure, sure.

542
00:21:32,219 --> 00:21:34,219
The problem is you can't do this on Apple because

543
00:21:34,229 --> 00:21:35,949
you don't get to touch the hardware that way.

544
00:21:36,189 --> 00:21:37,119
That's probably fair.

545
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:39,449
And I, who cares? You don't look if this is,

546
00:21:39,579 --> 00:21:41,839
it is a legitimate concern you have, which I don't think it should be.

547
00:21:41,849 --> 00:21:43,959
If this is a legitimate concern you have,

548
00:21:44,349 --> 00:21:47,829
you're dealing with an attacker with capabilities

549
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,560
probably beyond anything.

550
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:52,479
-- You can truly defend
-- against one of those $20 USB

551
00:21:52,489 --> 00:21:54,510
cables that has a built in Wi Fi transmitter,

552
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:58,560
but you're still dealing with an attacker that almost certainly has abilities.

553
00:21:58,569 --> 00:21:59,829
You cannot counteract,

554
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:02,489
I think. And that's the thing with all of this radio stuff, right?

555
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,660
Like Tetra burst is part of this story is tetra burst was created

556
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:09,020
at a time when the only people who could basically break this

557
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:11,040
were people that didn't need to break it,

558
00:22:11,219 --> 00:22:11,609
right?

559
00:22:11,699 --> 00:22:15,869
Because they already had probably access to all this data anyway, that was going on.

560
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,530
And I think when we think about radio,

561
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:20,349
it's very similar,

562
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:22,589
I think to like someone sniffing internet traffic where

563
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:24,910
you can apply TLS to your internet traffic,

564
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,810
you can, there's a certain amount of stuff you can do.

565
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:28,989
But fundamentally, there are Attackers

566
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:33,469
that have capabilities beyond our imaginations and we can't stop them.

567
00:22:33,479 --> 00:22:34,150
It's kind of like,

568
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:38,050
remember all the research talking about how if you looked at SSH packet,

569
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,329
you could figure out passwords people were typing in

570
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:44,609
that is an attacker with a capability. I cannot stop.

571
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:46,689
Well, except now that,

572
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:48,569
that used to be hard. And now

573
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:51,349
as long as I can get traffic, I can just feed it through an A I,

574
00:22:51,569 --> 00:22:51,630
you

575
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,920
can get the traffic, you're already in a point where I can't functionally take,

576
00:22:57,819 --> 00:22:59,520
I would say good defense against you.

577
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,150
But part of the challenge here, for example,

578
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,939
the OMG Elite Cable is 100 and 80 bucks retail,

579
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:04,520
right?

580
00:23:04,989 --> 00:23:07,020
And that's not a ton of money.

581
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:07,930
No, it's not.

582
00:23:07,939 --> 00:23:11,739
But here's the thing, I'm not just talking about nation State Attackers.

583
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,859
I'm saying

584
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:16,569
if someone has an OMG cable and they know how to properly use

585
00:23:16,579 --> 00:23:19,119
it and they can get into your organization and plug it in,

586
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,050
you can't stop them

587
00:23:21,339 --> 00:23:23,800
like, and, and that's ok. I'm not saying

588
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:27,979
it's good or bad necessarily or I'm dumb or they're smart or, or what, what not,

589
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:28,189
right?

590
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:29,890
It's just, it's one of those things that

591
00:23:30,219 --> 00:23:32,729
I think in many attacker, defender relationships,

592
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:36,660
there's always going to be a skew in one direction or the other. I would say

593
00:23:36,969 --> 00:23:37,900
asymmetry.

594
00:23:38,189 --> 00:23:39,949
Yeah, an asymmetry. That's better. Right.

595
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:41,180
You're looking for asymmetry, like,

596
00:23:41,189 --> 00:23:43,739
like it'll always be cheaper for me to throw a brick through

597
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,180
your window at your house than for you to defend it.

598
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:47,500
Right. For sure. Right. Right.

599
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,689
Yeah, I could put, you know,

600
00:23:48,699 --> 00:23:50,479
a bunch of metal bars on my window and now

601
00:23:50,489 --> 00:23:53,290
I can't see out my window and life is terrible.

602
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,619
Right. Like for sure,

603
00:23:54,829 --> 00:23:57,170
there's always that and I think all of this wireless,

604
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:00,459
everything that everyone keeps talking about is a very similar situation.

605
00:24:00,469 --> 00:24:00,790
Like

606
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,689
let's pick on the flight jamming

607
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:05,180
for Airlines.

608
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,609
Airlines should not be relying on civilian GPS. Right.

609
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,280
Well, and that's the thing, right? There's so there's GPS, there's GLO,

610
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:14,180
there's the Chinese one whose name I can never remember.

611
00:24:14,189 --> 00:24:17,119
There's the terrestrial radio stations like the one in Hamburg

612
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:20,280
that broadcast a signal like the old uh us Loran

613
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,540
system, you know, at,

614
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:21,800
at

615
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,719
various points on the coast.

616
00:24:24,189 --> 00:24:27,469
And then in theory, like I get that a,

617
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:30,890
a small private plane might not have an inertial guidance system, but, you know,

618
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,800
something like a 737 and up should

619
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:34,180
maybe have one

620
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:35,040
maybe.

621
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:35,290
Well,

622
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:39,089
because GPS does go down or glitches or weather or

623
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:41,119
part of the challenge too is the skills atrophy,

624
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:41,369
right?

625
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,569
Like most people cannot navigate, given a map and a compass

626
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:47,390
and, and I was guilty of this too. I was at a playground.

627
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,400
I was at a playground and they had the thing pointing

628
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:51,589
north and it was off by 25 or 30 degrees.

629
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:52,869
And I'm like, oh, that looks pretty bad.

630
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,729
And then I actually checked the magnetic deflection here in Edmonton.

631
00:24:55,739 --> 00:24:58,910
And it's like, oh, no, that's actually correct. That is because I live so far north.

632
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,140
Like our, our

633
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,869
north and our magnetic north are off by like 30 degrees.

634
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,660
Everyone's is off by quite a bit now because the, the north pole is moving.

635
00:25:08,045 --> 00:25:11,425
Well, it wanders about 100 m a year since forever.

636
00:25:11,435 --> 00:25:13,545
And there's like a beautiful map where it's just kind of like, do, do, do, do,

637
00:25:13,685 --> 00:25:13,704
do,

638
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:13,824
do.

639
00:25:14,564 --> 00:25:16,494
But the skills atrophy people aren't even aware

640
00:25:16,505 --> 00:25:17,805
of that because they just rely on GPS.

641
00:25:17,814 --> 00:25:18,875
And if GPS stops working

642
00:25:19,074 --> 00:25:19,824
below a compass,

643
00:25:19,944 --> 00:25:23,104
-- they're gonna walk into a lake or something.
-- No, they're not.

644
00:25:23,194 --> 00:25:25,224
Like if you're using a compass, you just

645
00:25:25,395 --> 00:25:29,305
look, the compass tells you like north is that ish direction, right?

646
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:30,974
Like that's, that's what it's for.

647
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:35,040
It's so when you're walking in a straight line, you walk in a straight line,

648
00:25:35,489 --> 00:25:37,479
that's really all the compass is good for.

649
00:25:37,489 --> 00:25:41,520
Well, and also for figuring out where you are, like, look at a landmark, take a shot,

650
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,050
compare your map,

651
00:25:43,349 --> 00:25:44,650
right? Like, but nobody,

652
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:47,760
so, but what gets me is like, nobody knows how to do that,

653
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:50,599
including probably a lot of airline pilots and who cares.

654
00:25:50,609 --> 00:25:53,599
-- They don't need to know how to do that. Well,
-- unless they're flying near Iran

655
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:57,869
they almost, apparently some planes almost wandered into Iranian airspace.

656
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,829
-- Which
-- that would be bad. I bet.

657
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:02,469
Well, I mean, they did sort of air quote again,

658
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:04,079
accidentally shoot down that airliner.

659
00:26:04,089 --> 00:26:04,560
That was,

660
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,229
you know.

661
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,119
Yeah,

662
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,689
it was a thing in Canada because we were grumpy about it

663
00:26:10,949 --> 00:26:11,640
again.

664
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,500
Putting all of this together. Right.

665
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:15,959
I think

666
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:19,819
there are security threats we can legitimately deal with and there's some,

667
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:22,020
we can't, and I think as humans,

668
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:25,329
we do a terrible job of obsessing over the dumb things.

669
00:26:25,569 --> 00:26:26,319
I think

670
00:26:26,439 --> 00:26:31,430
an example being if flying near Iran is causing GPS problems,

671
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:35,069
the solution in almost every instance is just, don't fly near Iran.

672
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:39,310
-- Yeah,
-- but you can't because you got to fly from A to B and Iran's in the way or

673
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,640
you have to just

674
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:40,829
go

675
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:42,229
around it.

676
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:43,109
Ok.

677
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:46,000
So you say that and yet there are almost every

678
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:48,670
flight in Canada to and from Toronto goes through us airspace

679
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,640
and so we have to submit passenger list to you guys and

680
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,229
when everybody was in an uproar about that and they're like,

681
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:55,140
why don't you just fly in Canada and the airlines are like,

682
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:58,479
that'll add like 10 minutes to the flight and cost this millions of dollars

683
00:26:59,109 --> 00:26:59,540
a year.

684
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:03,579
But then that means if you have and this is a perfect example, right?

685
00:27:03,849 --> 00:27:04,410
Saying

686
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:08,359
I'm taking this action and it's costing me this right.

687
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:12,079
This is a very this is the the security equation every time

688
00:27:12,489 --> 00:27:15,760
where by doing this, it's costing me this right?

689
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:18,800
Or by not doing this, it could cost me this Canada

690
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,500
having to fly to the US and submit passenger list to us.

691
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:25,319
Authorities is the price you pay to do that,

692
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,390
but there's other savings elsewhere, right?

693
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,550
If you need to fly near somewhere that is known to be blocking gps or,

694
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,420
or spoofing it or whatever

695
00:27:35,089 --> 00:27:37,510
that means, you need a way to deal with that.

696
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:37,709
Now,

697
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:39,209
it sounds like from what I read in the article

698
00:27:39,219 --> 00:27:41,209
and I'm not an aviation expert by any means,

699
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,569
but it sounds like they just call flight control and say

700
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,390
-- where
-- are we?

701
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,300
And flight control says

702
00:27:46,489 --> 00:27:46,859
here you

703
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,800
transponder

704
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:51,310
and that's great the solution, right? Maybe, maybe that's good enough.

705
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:51,829
Maybe it's not,

706
00:27:51,939 --> 00:27:52,839
maybe you need something else.

707
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:53,479
But the

708
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,250
one challenge there is, for example,

709
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,000
there was talk of movement towards transponders that

710
00:27:58,390 --> 00:27:59,800
you don't know where they are.

711
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:02,729
The transponder in theory knows where it is and reports where it is,

712
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,869
which is currently how most radar works.

713
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,680
It's not the old timey World War Two radar where it like paints the target and

714
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,199
gets a return and says like,

715
00:28:10,209 --> 00:28:12,380
oh there's a plane over there moving at the speed and height and whatever

716
00:28:12,709 --> 00:28:16,900
modern radar is like, I ping your transponder and your transponder replies with,

717
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:19,239
hey, yeah, I'm me at this flight level.

718
00:28:19,709 --> 00:28:22,810
-- Maybe. I don't know.
-- How else do you get the four numbers off? Right.

719
00:28:23,849 --> 00:28:25,619
I mean, well, yeah, the numbers for sure.

720
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:29,500
But, you know, I would assume the radar station decides where it is

721
00:28:29,699 --> 00:28:32,859
sometimes, but not really because

722
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:35,650
-- it's expensive and hard to manage and maintain. Well, it
-- is.

723
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:38,619
And again, you have that trade off. Right? Like is the trade off worth it?

724
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:39,359
I don't know.

725
00:28:39,699 --> 00:28:43,540
This is again where we talk about, you know, securing

726
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,969
terrestrial radio between

727
00:28:46,189 --> 00:28:49,180
police and fire and stuff. So Tetra burst has been hacked.

728
00:28:49,949 --> 00:28:51,660
Anyone can decode the messages.

729
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:55,420
Well, not, I wouldn't say hacked. It's just we actually published how it works.

730
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:56,380
And if that can,

731
00:28:56,709 --> 00:28:57,819
it's very hackable.

732
00:28:57,829 --> 00:28:58,219
The, the,

733
00:28:58,229 --> 00:29:01,609
the algorithm they use is crap because it's like very old and it was

734
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:03,469
created in secret and almost every encryption

735
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:05,380
algorithm created in secret is terrible.

736
00:29:06,194 --> 00:29:06,824
I was going for it.

737
00:29:07,214 --> 00:29:10,944
It's was created in secret. So right there, that's a huge black market.

738
00:29:11,505 --> 00:29:13,734
And number two, it's 20 years old. Like I'm sorry, but even

739
00:29:14,194 --> 00:29:16,994
it's like Des Three, Des Three was pretty decent.

740
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:20,525
And ok for the time, except everybody got laptops now with, you know, five gigahertz

741
00:29:20,864 --> 00:29:22,454
what was 20 years ago? Like

742
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:28,699
-- 1000 bit Rs A maybe
-- 20 years ago was, remember eff building deep crack.

743
00:29:28,989 --> 00:29:29,099
And

744
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:29,260
I

745
00:29:29,709 --> 00:29:29,969
remember that

746
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:30,760
I

747
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:31,020
was like

748
00:29:31,969 --> 00:29:36,589
-- $100,000
-- the 60 five bit key was cracked by us in a month

749
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,189
and it's like, I think my laptop will do it

750
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,349
basically,

751
00:29:40,699 --> 00:29:43,040
-- which is fine. That's how progress works.
-- Yeah.

752
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:43,989
But the problem is,

753
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,910
do you know what it's gonna cost to replace all those tetra radios?

754
00:29:46,949 --> 00:29:49,359
Well, no, no, no, here's ok. That's just it. Right.

755
00:29:49,369 --> 00:29:50,660
And this is what we're gonna close on.

756
00:29:51,579 --> 00:29:53,540
The cost is substantial.

757
00:29:53,689 --> 00:29:54,989
But does it really matter?

758
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,510
And the answer in almost every situation is it doesn't,

759
00:29:57,569 --> 00:30:01,089
if someone can listen to the police department talking in all seriousness,

760
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,680
I think that's probably a good thing.

761
00:30:02,689 --> 00:30:03,810
I don't think it's a bad thing.

762
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,060
I

763
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:06,680
see the problem I always have.

764
00:30:06,689 --> 00:30:07,750
And this goes, for example,

765
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,459
a great argument when people start talking about police body cams.

766
00:30:10,469 --> 00:30:14,079
I am generally in favor of transparency and for example, police body cams,

767
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:17,829
but they do get into situations where you don't want that stuff ever being public.

768
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:21,959
I think there are instances of that, but I I

769
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:26,170
this is a much larger discussion we're not going to have today.

770
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,270
There, there is certainly victims rights. There's, there's pieces of that,

771
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,319
but I think generally speaking, what's happening over radios

772
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,109
doesn't need to be a secret.

773
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:38,859
I would, I suspect in most instances the,

774
00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:42,979
the data traveling over a voice radio as used by Tetra

775
00:30:43,089 --> 00:30:43,520
burst

776
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:46,119
is not going to make the world the worst place.

777
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,890
In fact, encrypting it might make it worse.

778
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,109
Well, I feel like more to the point,

779
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:51,430
the majority of criminals are probably not going to be listening to it.

780
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:53,060
Like that used to be a thing sometimes. But,

781
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:56,864
you know, like the movies with the, you know, the bank robber sitting in the car,

782
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:58,344
I'm skeptical

783
00:30:58,574 --> 00:31:01,025
that was ever a legitimate concern.

784
00:31:01,155 --> 00:31:02,864
It's, well, it's one of those things where it,

785
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:05,505
it's happened enough that we have some anecdotal evidence for it.

786
00:31:05,515 --> 00:31:10,484
-- But like, is it a problem? I suspect,
-- I doubt it. I seriously doubt it. So, anyway,

787
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:12,704
and I think this is a perfect example. Right?

788
00:31:12,915 --> 00:31:17,944
The, the, the cost of fixing tetra burst versus the cost of keeping it

789
00:31:18,135 --> 00:31:19,905
is completely lopsided

790
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:24,729
and someday it'll something better will happen and come out.

791
00:31:24,739 --> 00:31:26,819
But for the foreseeable future, whatever,

792
00:31:26,829 --> 00:31:28,479
they're just going to keep using it because it works and

793
00:31:28,489 --> 00:31:32,089
they've had probably billions of dollars invested in radio equipment,

794
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:33,390
tens of billions

795
00:31:33,689 --> 00:31:33,719
in

796
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:35,890
the base stations, the radio equipment, everything.

797
00:31:36,209 --> 00:31:36,239
And

798
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,010
when you look at what

799
00:31:38,709 --> 00:31:42,060
organizations spend on radio equipment that need to spend on radio equipment,

800
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:43,369
it's actually quite shocking.

801
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:46,130
Well, no, it's not at all. I think this is a good example.

802
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:46,530
-- I would
-- have

803
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,869
thought it would be cheaper, but like,

804
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,170
I guess it's also stuff that you can drop and flush down the toilet.

805
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:56,170
This isn't consumer grade equipment. This is like essentially industrial grade.

806
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,939
-- These guys are IP 68. You can't
-- say

807
00:32:00,189 --> 00:32:00,280
no

808
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:00,790
one knows what you're

809
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:01,069
doing

810
00:32:01,349 --> 00:32:04,189
-- is holding up a radio.
-- I'm holding up a walkie talkie.

811
00:32:04,199 --> 00:32:06,599
I bought these for, uh, actually for skiing

812
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,130
because they have a, uh, 16

813
00:32:08,489 --> 00:32:09,069
Ketter range.

814
00:32:09,949 --> 00:32:12,579
They work reasonably well in the mountains. They're IP 68

815
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:13,099
uh,

816
00:32:13,189 --> 00:32:14,569
which is important if you're skiing because

817
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:16,079
it's going to be outside and getting snow

818
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:16,729
on it.

819
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:19,660
And they were not that expensive. They were less than 100 bucks each.

820
00:32:19,949 --> 00:32:23,420
Yeah. And that's those radios. I would not trust my life with in any way.

821
00:32:24,089 --> 00:32:27,060
-- But I mean, I just,
-- here's my favorite example of this, right?

822
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:31,489
It's where people mock like the military for spending so much money on stuff,

823
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,319
let's say, right?

824
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:36,560
But at the same time, this is a situation where this piece of hardware fails,

825
00:32:36,569 --> 00:32:37,890
someone dies.

826
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:42,270
-- Are you going cheap out on that? Like, I hope not
-- or worse? The, the attack fails.

827
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,359
Well, then they probably die like

828
00:32:45,699 --> 00:32:49,890
it changes the equation substantially when it goes from this minorly

829
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,609
inconveniences me to this will literally kill me if it fails.

830
00:32:53,619 --> 00:32:53,869
Well,

831
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,439
my favorite is I was just watching a history of the Battle of Midway and there was

832
00:32:57,719 --> 00:33:01,390
the Japanese apparently should have scouted the American forces,

833
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,609
but there was cloud cover and the guy flying the,

834
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:06,800
the one scale plane there was like 10 or so of them going, you know, in a radio pattern.

835
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:10,900
He was above the clouds and didn't see the US task force. Oh, interesting.

836
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:11,619
Oops.

837
00:33:11,869 --> 00:33:14,900
Like it literally that could we could have different history books if

838
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:18,270
that one pilot had seen share a ship's wake or something.

839
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,750
And like that's what gets me is if you read military history,

840
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,290
there are some insane levels of, like,

841
00:33:23,439 --> 00:33:25,979
just for want of a nail, right? The battle was lost.

842
00:33:26,489 --> 00:33:29,449
Yeah, I mean, that happens all the time for sure. Yep.

843
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,569
So I'm just looking at this with this radio stuff

844
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,670
is,

845
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:36,469
I do wonder, you know, will anything major happen from this? Right.

846
00:33:36,479 --> 00:33:40,540
Because we've had all these like log for J, I mean, as big a deal as log for Jay was like,

847
00:33:41,239 --> 00:33:43,099
I would argue there's a bunch of ransomware,

848
00:33:43,109 --> 00:33:44,599
exploiting six month old vulnerabilities.

849
00:33:44,609 --> 00:33:46,060
That's way more impactful.

850
00:33:46,069 --> 00:33:49,050
Yeah, I mean, that's always how it works and I think anything we talk about,

851
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,569
especially like in the radio space.

852
00:33:50,579 --> 00:33:52,180
Yeah, it's exactly the same story

853
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:56,300
that it's, it's the crap that's six years old. No one's patched

854
00:33:56,510 --> 00:34:00,699
and, and that's far more impactful than someone worrying about apple, putting

855

856
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:04,459
