Hello and welcome to the open source Security podcast episode 41 with myself,

1
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:11,329
Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime.

2
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,130
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,369 --> 00:00:13,229
What's New Kurt?

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,680
Well, still can't get a Nintendo switch.

5
00:00:17,159 --> 00:00:19,700
And Best Buy has now changed their phone message to

6
00:00:19,709 --> 00:00:21,319
say that we're not going to talk about it.

7
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:22,420
Go check our website.

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:27,040
You know, I wasn't gonna ask because I, I didn't want to make you feel bad.

9
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:28,739
It's ok.

10
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:33,479
But the good news is actually it's teaching Felix delayed gratification.

11
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:36,630
I mean, partly because he doesn't have a choice in the matter.

12
00:00:36,889 --> 00:00:38,880
And also because he's like, he, he wants to go spend,

13
00:00:38,889 --> 00:00:42,549
he wanted to go by like $60 worth of gems and Castle Crush or whatever.

14
00:00:42,569 --> 00:00:45,869
And I'm like, ok, we can buy that but then we can't get the, uh, the switch

15
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:46,869
and he's like,

16
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:47,240
oh,

17
00:00:47,409 --> 00:00:49,419
I want the switch. I'm like, thought

18
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,099
-- so
-- I

19
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:50,720
think that's a good

20
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:51,209
choice.

21
00:00:51,669 --> 00:00:51,930
Yeah.

22
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,919
Yeah. And the good news is I have gotten open

23
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:57,250
emu with, you know, um, some old controllers and stuff working on the TV.

24
00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:00,639
So he's getting a Super Mario fix

25
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:00,979
it.

26
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:03,810
There's not even Mario on the switch though.

27
00:01:03,819 --> 00:01:06,709
The only game that's really any good is Zelda,

28
00:01:09,389 --> 00:01:09,559
please.

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,279
Noon's

30
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,330
not out yet.

31
00:01:12,279 --> 00:01:13,540
Uh,

32
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,900
one of the websites was gonna let me buy it.

33
00:01:16,199 --> 00:01:20,199
Are you sure you're buying Splatoon and not like an empty box?

34
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:21,569
It's

35
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:21,849
Amazon.

36
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:27,010
So that, like the Super Mario run fake apps sort of thing? Like you're an

37
00:01:27,699 --> 00:01:27,750
empty

38
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,209
-- box?
-- Well, I Right. Right.

39
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,410
-- I was gonna say, I remember this, this was like PS two days, I think when the PS
-- two

40
00:01:35,139 --> 00:01:35,580
switch,

41
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:36,839
Nintendo,

42
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:37,980
is it out?

43
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:39,690
I don't think it's out yet.

44
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:44,680
Ah, this item is not yet released. Pre,

45
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,709
why would I preorder something that has no release date?

46
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:50,629
Because

47
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,930
like, if it had like a release date of like, like,

48
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:53,930
um, you know,

49
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,190
I pre-ordered a book and they had like a specific release date and being a book, it's,

50
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:59,559
you know, probably gonna hit that release date.

51
00:01:59,589 --> 00:02:03,690
But I've never understood people who pre buy stuff, especially when it has like,

52
00:02:03,699 --> 00:02:05,309
no release date.

53
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:11,330
-- Uh,
-- well, not only that, the, the true irony of it all is for something like platoon,

54
00:02:11,429 --> 00:02:15,100
you can just download it from their app store on the day it comes out.

55
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:17,979
So why pre release by it at

56
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,929
-- all?
-- Right.

57
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,520
In case you don't have bandwidth or you're stupid. I

58
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:22,850
don't know, I don't know,

59
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,270
I kind of want to have the physical games though because

60
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:27,610
all chances are I'll end up with more than one switch

61
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:30,479
-- and I don't know how that sharing stuff works.
-- I

62
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,130
don't know if I had to guess it won't because Nintendo

63
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:39,419
has never done a good job of the kind of online multi

64
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,410
everything

65
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,529
-- universe.
-- Well, even if they're hooked up to the same account, can you do that?

66
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,139
I, well, there is no really hooking up to the same account at this point. So

67
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,460
we don't know. Well, well, that's like you can't even back up your safe.

68
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,029
There are reports of people who sent in their switch

69
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:59,179
for repairs and they lost their like 4000 hours of Zelda

70
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,460
that was on the safe.

71
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,059
So,

72
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,589
so Nintendo went full out DRM with this, which I, you know,

73
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,029
every console is full out DRM.

74
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,350
But

75
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,860
the other guys like Microsoft and Sony have the ability to

76
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:13,039
like upload your saves to the cloud and things like that.

77
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,039
And Nintendo has none of that today.

78
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,339
I'm sure they will.

79
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,949
-- But
-- Nintendo has never really been like an online gaming company, right?

80
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,490
They've always been sort of that more traditional console and, you know,

81
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,039
and they're, they're good at that, like the fact that I pulled my wii out of the,

82
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,380
you know, box in the garage and it just works

83
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,880
and the games are still fun,

84
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,110
you know,

85
00:03:30,809 --> 00:03:31,509
I'll give him that.

86
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:36,589
But speaking of like learning and sharing Nintendo switches actually,

87
00:03:37,619 --> 00:03:41,380
uh do you wanna talk about the insanity or shall I?

88
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:46,500
Oh man, this is, why don't you intro this? Because I know as a frequent traveler.

89
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:49,169
That's just uh the pain I feel from reading the story.

90
00:03:50,009 --> 00:03:53,759
So the deal is we don't know why people have been, you know, making.

91
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,399
There's been tons of rumors and conspiracy theories,

92
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:00,520
but what it boils down to is a bunch of Middle Eastern airlines

93
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:05,850
have been uh given essentially a rule by the US government saying

94
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,169
like, uh yeah, you,

95
00:04:07,179 --> 00:04:11,169
you can't have people bringing laptops or like ipads onto the plane anymore,

96
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:13,570
right?

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,750
Which I, I think we briefly discussed this an episode or two ago and Schneier

98
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,119
had a little write up where it sounded like

99
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,369
this was not politically motivated, but there was real intelligence behind it.

100
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:27,209
But it's still just, oh man, I can't imagine.

101
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:30,410
I don't want to go on a plane with my kids without their ipads

102
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:31,339
and,

103
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:32,100
you

104
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:32,329
know,

105
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,850
-- ignoring
-- the Children, even just

106
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:39,779
number one. I don't wanna let my laptop out of my possession for that long.

107
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:44,619
I don't trust the baggage handlers to not like, stop on my bag or like, you know,

108
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,850
like crush it with a fork,

109
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,670
that

110
00:04:48,109 --> 00:04:51,190
laptop, the tablet, like a small tablet

111
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,269
that I thought was reasonably robust, got like folded in half, well,

112
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:57,149
not fold and a half but bent enough that the screen was just crashed

113
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,269
with the little TS a inspection, you know, ticket inside. Thanks.

114
00:05:01,144 --> 00:05:01,265
Yeah.

115
00:05:01,274 --> 00:05:01,954
Well, I mean, it,

116
00:05:01,964 --> 00:05:04,644
it never ceases to amaze me when the few times I

117
00:05:04,654 --> 00:05:06,825
do have to check a bag for one reason or another

118
00:05:06,924 --> 00:05:08,755
and you go to that carousel and like some of these

119
00:05:08,765 --> 00:05:11,385
bags look like they've literally been run over by a truck.

120
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:15,334
-- And I'm like, how does this even happen?
-- Because that does happen? I mean,

121
00:05:15,845 --> 00:05:18,785
you've seen the videos, like, where, like, you know, what was it?

122
00:05:18,795 --> 00:05:20,434
Like, Delta broke my guitar,

123
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:23,929
you know, the guy made a song about it and finally, Shane, Delta or whatever,

124
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,459
he was giving his

125
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:25,529
money

126
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,970
back or the guy, you know, where they're, they're doing the air side check.

127
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,250
So basically the, you're boarding a small plane and they're like, yeah,

128
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,500
we have no more room for bags.

129
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,769
So like drop your bags at the,

130
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:38,744
you know, in the hallway of the, uh, the gangway, the jetway thing here,

131
00:05:38,915 --> 00:05:40,924
you know, and then we'll have somebody to carry your bags onto the plane,

132
00:05:40,934 --> 00:05:42,545
like the belly of the plane, put them in

133
00:05:42,714 --> 00:05:44,945
and then at the other end they'll be pulled out and put by, you know,

134
00:05:44,954 --> 00:05:48,135
when you walk off the plane, you'll get your bags, which honestly when it works,

135
00:05:48,144 --> 00:05:48,704
it works quite well.

136
00:05:48,714 --> 00:05:51,494
The problem is, is jet ways, you know, there's a lot of stairs

137
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:52,989
and so I guess,

138
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,450
you know, instead of walking the bags down, they were just, you know,

139
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:57,540
just kind of kicking them off the edge.

140
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:01,779
I've never seen them do that. I've seen a lot of times they have a slide

141
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,739
to send them down and, yeah, I mean, they, they fall on the ground.

142
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,299
I mean, if you had anything,

143
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,950
uh, very breakable in your bag,

144
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,649
it would break without

145
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,690
it goes down to is, it's, you have to treat your baggage

146
00:06:13,869 --> 00:06:14,410
like

147
00:06:14,739 --> 00:06:17,309
something you're shipping through ups or fedex,

148
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:17,910
you

149
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,200
have to be able to, with

150
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,690
a 3 ft drop, you know, because it will,

151
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,670
you know, you know, what's actually really funny is I remember

152
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:26,359
when I was much, much younger,

153
00:06:26,739 --> 00:06:31,170
I was working for a company and we had to ship a demo system to a trade show.

154
00:06:31,179 --> 00:06:33,609
And this was like, back when computers were really big and heavy

155
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,500
and this was like a full tower system, right? So this thing was enormous.

156
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,359
It probably weighed more than 50 pounds.

157
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,299
And

158
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,250
I remember,

159
00:06:43,179 --> 00:06:43,190
I

160
00:06:43,299 --> 00:06:46,420
know I'll never forget we ship it out to the conference and it gets there,

161
00:06:46,429 --> 00:06:48,820
which is great and, and it, it worked.

162
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:51,839
I, I was really concerned actually that it wasn't gonna work when it got there

163
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,019
anyway. It gets there. It works demos great.

164
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:58,100
And I remember I was at the loading dock when the ups happened to show up

165
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,029
and

166
00:06:59,179 --> 00:07:01,089
like, the dude opens the door and I'm like, oh,

167
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,420
I bet this is a computer coming back and he literally

168
00:07:03,429 --> 00:07:05,820
just like wings the box out of the back of the,

169
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:07,750
and it flies through the air in LA.

170
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,600
And I looked at him and I was like, did you really need to do that?

171
00:07:10,609 --> 00:07:13,160
He's like, hey, this thing's heavy and I'm sick of carrying it and I was like,

172
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,230
ok, thank you. You know, I was like, sign here,

173
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,769
I like part of me thought I just shouldn't sign for this thing,

174
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:23,660
but whatever I got it and actually we, we packed it up really well.

175
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,829
So it, it had no damage even after its little uh flight.

176
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:27,470
But

177
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,470
yeah, man, it's, I,

178
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,209
I get it and that's kind of the way you have to think about baggage on airlines.

179
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,769
But anyway, that's not the point here.

180
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:34,700
The point is

181
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,380
what do you do with no laptop?

182
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,480
Yeah. Well, how do the airlines keep their business customers happy?

183
00:07:40,489 --> 00:07:42,910
Cause like those guys are paying like 10 grand a seat.

184
00:07:43,049 --> 00:07:46,179
I would, in fact, you know what's funny is thinking about this,

185
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,480
I would seriously consider like driving a long distance to an airport that didn't

186
00:07:50,489 --> 00:07:53,920
-- have this rule if I was not an
-- option in the Middle East.

187
00:07:53,929 --> 00:07:56,959
-- Unfortunately.
-- Yeah, probably not. Probably not. So

188
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,079
anyways the airline

189
00:07:58,274 --> 00:08:01,545
have what? On the surface of it seems a reasonable

190
00:08:01,845 --> 00:08:05,984
solution, right? We're just gonna have a bunch of loner laptops on the plane,

191
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,505
-- right?
-- Which you know, on the surface of it is not

192
00:08:10,415 --> 00:08:10,855
terrible.

193
00:08:11,355 --> 00:08:12,184
It's like those public

194
00:08:12,364 --> 00:08:13,244
kiosks at hotels.

195
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:17,265
That's the first thing that came into my mind and the people using them.

196
00:08:17,274 --> 00:08:18,464
It's terrifying to me.

197
00:08:19,109 --> 00:08:19,399
So I

198
00:08:19,609 --> 00:08:19,649
think

199
00:08:19,809 --> 00:08:22,989
so every time I am at a hotel there is someone sitting at those

200
00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:26,750
kiosks, like I'll see people on their bank website and, and I'm just like,

201
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,100
I wanna grab them and shake them and be like, what's wrong with you?

202
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,020
And, uh, oh, my goodness.

203
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:34,820
So, here's the question I have,

204
00:08:36,109 --> 00:08:36,568
uh,

205
00:08:36,707 --> 00:08:38,398
I mean, well, obviously it's, it's,

206
00:08:38,408 --> 00:08:41,789
you can't use one of these safely if you're using the operating

207
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,369
system and software that's pre installed on it because it could be,

208
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:45,359
have God knows what.

209
00:08:45,369 --> 00:08:47,669
And there's no way for you to reliably detect that, right?

210
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:49,919
Like even if you go to malware bytes or something, you could be, you know,

211
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:50,898
whatever point is

212
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:53,408
you can't trust the operating system and the

213
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:54,809
and the software installed on that machine.

214
00:08:54,818 --> 00:08:55,848
So here's the second question.

215
00:08:56,229 --> 00:09:00,190
So let's then we need to be able to boot off of like an external USB device, right?

216
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,409
You bring your own USB key with your operating system.

217
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,239
Normal people can do this, no problem.

218
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,010
Normal people won't. But you know,

219
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,080
their it department might have them do this if they know that this is happening,

220
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:10,330
right?

221
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:10,869
I mean,

222
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:12,820
-- because what other choice do they have?
-- Right? We'll

223
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:13,690
just pretend.

224
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:14,690
So

225
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,539
one

226
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,489
question I would have is, is, can we also even do that safely?

227
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:25,130
Can we safely boot off of a USB stick onto unknown hardware

228
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,169
and be

229
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:29,630
guaranteed of our safety and security?

230
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,059
And I think the answer is no, because for all, you know,

231
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,409
there's like some sort of co processor running or

232
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:36,250
they interrupt or inject something into the boot process.

233
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:37,770
Ok. Look. Right.

234
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,609
You can't be 100% certain, but unless

235
00:09:41,969 --> 00:09:43,960
a three letter agency is after you,

236
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,650
you're probably ok if you do that.

237
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:50,520
Well, see, and then this loops back to my written or a second thought I have is

238
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:52,049
so for the sake of argument, we,

239
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:54,960
we definitely can't be safe using their software and operating system and

240
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:59,059
we can be reasonably safe against not a state

241
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,510
level actor but against like normal kind of Attackers

242
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,640
if we boot off a USB thing. But

243
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,880
the reality is,

244
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,299
yeah, people aren't really going to do that because it's too much hassle.

245
00:10:08,979 --> 00:10:09,919
So here's my question,

246
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,309
for example, using,

247
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,809
if you're just accessing cloud services, can you do that reasonably safely?

248
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,450
And, and like what I'm thinking the scenario is, for example,

249
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,280
you set up like say a throwaway account,

250
00:10:21,479 --> 00:10:23,859
um that you use, you know, for your trip,

251
00:10:24,099 --> 00:10:24,330
you know,

252
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,849
and that might start being a thing because

253
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,909
also with all the border searches and stuff,

254
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:28,549
you know, where

255
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:30,150
it doesn't matter if you have a USB

256
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:32,049
stick in a heavily encrypted system because they're,

257
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:33,789
they're gonna make you decrypt it.

258
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,599
I've actually done.

259
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:35,830
You have to

260
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,219
for defcon

261
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:40,940
is I create essentially a bunch of burn burner burner

262
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,229
gear and burner accounts and I don't use anything real.

263
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:44,900
Yeah.

264
00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:45,830
And so for example,

265
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,150
you set up basically a burner account with say just the sales

266
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,190
presentation you need and just access to that one client or,

267
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,650
you know, whatever it is you specifically need.

268
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:56,460
So if there is a breach, it's, it's as contained as possible,

269
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,750
right? But, but here's the deal too is you talk about this,

270
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:06,919
like, it's a practical thing to do and for someone who only travels say once a month

271
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,770
you could do this.

272
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,619
But some of these guys are literally,

273
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:14,349
they live on airplanes and so they need like 400 burner accounts,

274
00:11:14,359 --> 00:11:15,369
which is not practical.

275
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,080
Well, but the thing is if their it department was setting this up,

276
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,530
I mean, because this could be totally automated, right?

277
00:11:20,539 --> 00:11:23,510
Like, oh you're going to the the the Alpha sales call.

278
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,830
Boom, here's your alpha account, ok? You're done with that.

279
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,280
We're closing it down, here's your access to the beta sales account.

280
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:29,919
Now the gamma sales account, you know,

281
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:33,669
that sounds like a lot of work man

282
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,929
and see, but, and one potential advantage would be for example, now is, you know,

283
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,179
you just have the guy traveling with like a blank ipad.

284
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,690
You don't have to worry about backups.

285
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,919
You don't have to worry about data, security, data encryption.

286
00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:45,229
It's because there's nothing with him,

287
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:47,330
right? It's all in the cloud.

288
00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:50,679
Here's the question I would have though is what

289
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,909
is actually the return on investment to doing this?

290
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,580
And I suspect it is a negative return because I think it cost a lot of money

291
00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:02,630
and I suspect the benefit is minimal. I mean, look, let's face it,

292
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,659
the vast majority of people

293
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,260
could probably use that,

294
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:11,020
that airplane loaner laptop and even if their accounts get stolen,

295
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,590
it's still not even gonna really impact anything drastically

296
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:17,020
for now.

297
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:20,750
But what I'm thinking of is more, you know, as, as for example, the world is changing,

298
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:20,869
right.

299
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,909
We're now talking about encrypting all web traffic whereas, you know,

300
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:24,969
10 years ago it was

301
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:25,219
just

302
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:25,429
a

303
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:25,820
lot

304
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:27,059
of crazy people did it.

305
00:12:27,969 --> 00:12:28,429
No, no.

306
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,799
When you look at things like Cloudflare,

307
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:32,510
they're encrypting a significant portion of the world's web traffic.

308
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,070
-- Ok. That's true. Cloud flare is doing a nice job
-- and then there's less

309
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,909
encrypt and then there's all the, you know,

310
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:40,690
hosting providers that are tying into let's encrypt with a plug in.

311
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,830
So it's just automatic, you know, click a button.

312
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:44,169
Well, right.

313
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,669
So here's kind of the way I view that though is

314
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:50,669
it, it's a bit like the space program.

315
00:12:50,989 --> 00:12:53,460
We went to the moon in the sixties

316
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,770
and then we never went back. Why do you think that is?

317
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,169
-- Well, there's, there's no real economic reason to do so,
-- that's part of it.

318
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:05,239
But also we were technically capable of doing that in the sixties,

319
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:09,080
but it was an enormous amount of work to actually accomplish it.

320
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,150
Not unlike

321
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:13,599
run using certificates, say five or 10 years ago

322
00:13:13,729 --> 00:13:17,390
where you could technically do this. But it was a monumental amount of work

323
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:18,559
and now

324
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:23,020
there are certain economic incentives that have lowered the cost of adoption.

325
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:26,890
Not unlike our private space program that we see now where essentially

326
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,570
we've got a bunch of billionaires racing each other to Mars.

327
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:30,530
And

328
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:31,890
I, I see that and,

329
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,789
and this kind of falls into that category where if this

330
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:38,719
is something that is the future and it might be,

331
00:13:38,729 --> 00:13:40,140
I'm not gonna say it is or isn't it

332
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,049
is?

333
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:44,929
It's technically possible today, but at great cost and pain,

334
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:45,919
-- where
-- is

335
00:13:46,219 --> 00:13:46,239
the

336
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:47,520
cheap? And

337
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:48,890
that's just it, right?

338
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:53,270
If this is the future in five or 10 years, this is going to be cheap and easy to do.

339
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:54,640
-- And so
-- again, there are,

340
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:58,039
there are already services that sort of do this, right?

341
00:13:58,049 --> 00:14:00,030
Those cloud access security brokers,

342
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,419
right? That essentially act as a centralized point of

343
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:08,260
uh control for like all your cloud services, right? For your accounts and stuff.

344
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,200
Yeah, it, it's kind of a start and

345
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,960
this might be

346
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,559
something to start thinking about.

347
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,119
In fact, this is something I've been really sensitive to lately is

348
00:14:16,359 --> 00:14:21,159
I'm starting to make an effort to detach myself from a physical machine

349
00:14:21,409 --> 00:14:25,200
because that makes moving around when I travel, for example, a lot easier.

350
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:28,559
It makes even just like switching computers in the house easier, things like that.

351
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:28,880
And

352
00:14:29,349 --> 00:14:30,239
I'm finding

353
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,789
it's pretty easy to do, you know, even, even three years ago, I think

354
00:14:34,969 --> 00:14:38,780
I would have suffered trying to actually exist like this and now, I mean,

355
00:14:38,789 --> 00:14:41,919
I keep most things in, in a Google Drive for example.

356
00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:45,710
And it, it just works. It's no big deal and all the data is there.

357
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,250
I can access it easily wherever I'm at. It's,

358
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:49,719
it's fantastic, man.

359
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,419
Yeah. Well, I mean, I, I've already done that.

360
00:14:52,429 --> 00:14:53,469
That's, that's, I hate to say it,

361
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:55,859
but that's one of the reasons I picked Apple products is because

362
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,570
how do I set up a new computer?

363
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,260
Like I, I basically bought one of my son's a new ipad this week.

364
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:04,700
And so I got his old ipad because it's a newer one than my ipad.

365
00:15:04,739 --> 00:15:07,900
And so basically, all I had to do was factory wipe it

366
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,330
and turn it on and log into my icloud

367
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,780
account and, and then just wait

368
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,150
and then like 2030 minutes later,

369
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:17,400
it was my ipad.

370
00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:19,590
And the only thing I had remained to do was, you know,

371
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:21,909
re enter all my passwords into my email accounts

372
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,880
and, and that's it. It's done. It's, this is now my ipad.

373
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:26,940
Um

374
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:31,520
And like at home, I'm down to, you know, two firewalls, one for each network link.

375
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,169
And then,

376
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,340
and those are like small hardware devices, you know, and then

377
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:38,590
I still have a file server just for hosting a ton of media because

378
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:41,619
I don't have a fast enough upload to like,

379
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,960
basically dump all the stuff into the cloud in a reasonable amount of time.

380
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,299
Otherwise, I, I honestly would

381
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:51,380
-- and I would get rid of my file server.
-- Did I tell you about my backup to S3?

382
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,809
It took literally two months to upload all the data.

383
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,909
Yeah, exactly.

384
00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:01,419
So, you know, I just, I, I, but the thing is all the data I care about like is,

385
00:16:01,429 --> 00:16:03,640
is backed up to the cloud automatically because it's, you know,

386
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,679
it's in my my documents directory or whatever that just automatically is

387
00:16:06,789 --> 00:16:10,619
also replicated to all my machines. You know, so when I make a change,

388
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,929
even locally, it gets replicated to, you know, my other two

389
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,179
uh desktop,

390
00:16:16,229 --> 00:16:16,969
I'm gonna last saw

391
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,989
us back in here.

392
00:16:18,169 --> 00:16:21,700
So, but yeah, so back to the laptops, I think, I think what will happen is like,

393
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:25,109
for example, if you had a cloud based desktop, like a Citrix type environment,

394
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,909
you know, a lot of companies already do that because not only, I mean,

395
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:28,840
it's not a security thing,

396
00:16:28,849 --> 00:16:31,400
it's just simply like we're not going to set up every single

397
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:34,260
desktop to run these apps because we'll just centrally manage it.

398
00:16:34,849 --> 00:16:35,729
And so

399
00:16:36,099 --> 00:16:39,859
the reality is, you know, you and I have both been on planes now where and,

400
00:16:39,869 --> 00:16:42,460
and these are not like even first class nice, you know,

401
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:47,340
Dubai or what is it? Emirates Air. What's the nice one in the Middle East now?

402
00:16:47,989 --> 00:16:48,020
Uh

403
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:48,530
Emirates

404
00:16:48,669 --> 00:16:52,710
Airways, is it or whatever? You know, we're talking like, like Delta and Jet

405
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,369
like, you know, United

406
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:56,869
and the internet on those things is good enough that, you know,

407
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,049
you and I were talking, I was, I was actually, you know, working with github

408
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:01,559
and,

409
00:17:01,859 --> 00:17:02,760
you know, uh

410
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:07,729
downloading and uploading data and, like, checking my email and, you know,

411
00:17:07,739 --> 00:17:10,540
talking in real time to people, you know,

412
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:12,199
it works pretty well. I agree.

413
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:12,780
Yeah.

414
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:13,880
You know, so,

415
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:17,430
I mean, I don't know that a cloud based desktop maybe would have enough bandwidth.

416
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,868
I don't know. I mean, I'm guessing those things are pretty good with,

417
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,880
uh, compression and what not. But,

418
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:22,858
you know, that's the, be a

419
00:17:23,979 --> 00:17:24,020
LA.

420
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,780
Yeah, that latency is the problem.

421
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:26,530
And so,

422
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,699
but what it boils down to though is an it department if all I had to deal with was like,

423
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:31,719
here's your tablet log into it.

424
00:17:31,729 --> 00:17:32,500
Ok. We're done.

425
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:37,150
Right. As an it guy that, you know, I've had to support desktops in the past.

426
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,119
I, you know, my first, one of my first jobs was supporting Windows NT 3.51

427
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,560
and Windows 95 in a government office.

428
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:47,199
I got really good at reinstalling Windows 95 because there was,

429
00:17:47,209 --> 00:17:48,160
that's how you fixed it.

430
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,489
You know, what's really funny is I remember when I was in college,

431
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,780
I think it was 95 or 98 was on the systems.

432
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,079
I forget which one it was.

433
00:17:55,579 --> 00:18:00,130
But we had this system set up and I forget it was some product that, that they bought.

434
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:03,119
But basically every time you booted the machine,

435
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:06,199
it just re imaged the machine off the file server.

436
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,199
And so I, I forget what it was called.

437
00:18:08,209 --> 00:18:10,800
Well, there was like a central file server with the machine images.

438
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,800
-- It actually was like ghosting it and redoing
-- it.

439
00:18:13,109 --> 00:18:14,069
It wasn't ghost. It was

440
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,180
some like off brand but same basic idea

441
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,910
and, and yeah, essentially,

442
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,910
like every night we'd shut down all the computers because we knew in

443
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,030
the morning when we turn them back on they would just reimage themselves.

444
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,920
Like we didn't even care and let's face it back then too.

445
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,760
Like, there was no such thing really as security.

446
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:32,109
Like, if you wanted to become an admin it wasn't very hard to do.

447
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:36,339
Well, I remember, you know. Yeah, just all that stuff and, yeah.

448
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:36,670
And I mean,

449
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,280
back then it's funny because actually people started getting into the habit

450
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:42,319
of treating their fleets of machines as cattle and not pets.

451
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:42,500
That's

452
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:42,880
true.

453
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,719
Security was so bad and then security got a little better and we went back to pets.

454
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,000
Yeah. Exactly.

455
00:18:48,459 --> 00:18:48,939
Um, yeah.

456
00:18:48,949 --> 00:18:53,380
No, I very much try not to teach or to teach to treat my machines like pets because,

457
00:18:53,579 --> 00:18:56,780
you know, at some point I am going to fold my laptop in half or sit on it or,

458
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:00,369
or my kids are gonna, you know, get juice into it or whatever.

459
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:00,680
Right.

460
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:03,630
And I don't wanna have to spend, like, 10 hours recreating my laptop.

461
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,849
-- It's true,
-- actually, you know, what I'm,

462
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:07,260
I'm doing that now is so you'll love this story.

463
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:08,390
My neighbor,

464
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:13,349
well, not my neighbor. It's my, the neighbor of my parents. Ok, calls me up yesterday

465
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:18,109
and first he calls and I was on the phone and I see this guy called and he's an,

466
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:19,750
an older gentleman will say.

467
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,459
And I look, and I'm like, all right, either something terrible has happened

468
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,989
or his computer is broken. Right. Right.

469
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,630
Right. And I'm like, I bet his computer is broken

470
00:19:28,949 --> 00:19:30,020
and I call him back

471
00:19:30,449 --> 00:19:32,030
and computer is broken

472
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,430
and then I'm, I'm talking to him. I'm like, so what's going on?

473
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,920
He said, I'm trying to get this stupid printer working

474
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,250
and, and he's like, I go, I went to their website

475
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:45,099
and now they're, uh, they're connected to my computer fixing it. And I said, what,

476
00:19:45,199 --> 00:19:48,209
what, what I'm like, what, what did you do?

477
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,150
And then you see

478
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:53,060
the story, it gets better, it gets better. So, anyway, was it legit

479
00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:54,140
or we'll get to that?

480
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,069
So, anyway, I'm like, what did you do?

481
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:01,969
He's like, I just, II, I typed in Canon printer in, in the, in the web browser.

482
00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:02,540
And I'm like,

483
00:20:02,949 --> 00:20:06,199
and where did you go? He's like, I went to Cannon printers.com.

484
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,930
And so I opened this website and it's like some,

485
00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:13,520
basically, it, it's just a front for some spam operation thing where they, they,

486
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,410
they get you to pay him a couple of 100 bucks.

487
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,609
They could they, like, connect into your computer with one of those remote

488
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,459
access points

489
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,369
and then

490
00:20:22,469 --> 00:20:25,569
they, like, mess it up and anyway, I'm talking to him and I'm like, what, what,

491
00:20:25,579 --> 00:20:26,290
what's going on?

492
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,609
He's like, yeah, they're in it right now and I said, what are they doing?

493
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:30,410
And he's like, oh, I don't know, they're gonna,

494
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,609
they're gonna install some antivirus for me.

495
00:20:32,619 --> 00:20:34,540
And they, and he, he's like, going through, I'm, like, just

496
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,660
unplug your internet.

497
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:40,290
All right, unplug your internet right now and just bring all of your stuff to my house

498
00:20:40,449 --> 00:20:43,209
and in a couple of days I'll bring it back to you. Ok.

499
00:20:43,219 --> 00:20:46,209
Because I'm like, I'm not even gonna try to talk to on the phone to pick,

500
00:20:46,219 --> 00:20:48,280
I don't wanna go to his house because his computer is kind of

501
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:51,290
old and it's gonna take like two weeks to clean the freaking thing.

502
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,479
So, anyway, I have it now in the other room. Uh,

503
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,800
running Windows update still, which has been happening for like,

504
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:59,869
almost a day because there's so much crap.

505
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,170
And it's like,

506
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:02,810
oh, my goodness, it's,

507
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:03,819
it's mad

508
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:04,609
man.

509
00:21:05,949 --> 00:21:09,260
II, I like two weeks ago, got my mom, uh,

510
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:12,010
she wanted to get a new printer because her existing printer is like dying.

511
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,349
So, yeah. Ok.

512
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:18,380
II, I found a, a reasonably priced color laser jet, you know, a little Samsung Joby.

513
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,180
And I, I also like Samsung because

514
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:23,770
they generally have not completely terrible drivers in software for their stuff,

515
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,459
like, say HP where you get a 600 megabyte blob

516
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,469
when all you want to do is like, print a picture. So anyways,

517
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:33,239
I'm like, whatever, I'm not gonna use the CD, I'm just gonna go to the website, right?

518
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,140
Because, well,

519
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:37,280
uh, you know, it'll be a bit faster and I'll get it up to date.

520
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:40,280
So I go to the website, you know, plug in the printer number, blah, blah, blah.

521
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,599
Ok, great. Download the thing,

522
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:43,369
start the install

523
00:21:44,209 --> 00:21:47,430
and, uh, it's like, do you want to install the drivers? Yes, obviously.

524
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:50,609
Do you want to install the, uh, like add on admin package? I'm like, sure.

525
00:21:50,619 --> 00:21:51,010
And it like,

526
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,770
installs the admin package and then it's like installing drivers and it just

527
00:21:53,989 --> 00:21:56,859
times out. Basically it sits there for like 5, 10 minutes and I kill it.

528
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,390
I do that like 23 times.

529
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:02,229
Yeah, the drivers from the Samsung website won't install, just flat out,

530
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:02,790
won't install.

531
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,680
So I use the CD,

532
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:06,719
the printer came with and the drivers install and just work perfectly.

533
00:22:06,729 --> 00:22:07,390
But it's like,

534
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:10,410
you know, how is a normal person supposed to deal with this crap?

535
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,170
There's like no hope, man. I, I know what you mean.

536
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,930
Well, in fact, funny enough, I have a Samsung color laser jet printer and it's,

537
00:22:15,939 --> 00:22:16,770
it's amazing.

538
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,449
But,

539
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,920
yeah, getting like getting their drivers to work was a pain.

540
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:20,930
So, you know what I did is I,

541
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:22,949
I hooked it up to my file server in the

542
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:26,050
basement and it just has like a postscript interface now

543
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,369
and I just installed generic postscript drivers and

544
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,530
all the machines and they print just fine.

545
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:34,329
Yeah. II, I would not want to walk somebody through that

546
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:35,579
-- and
-- that's just it. Right.

547
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:41,229
I wouldn't dream of expecting anyone but me to set something up like this. It's,

548
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:41,449
uh,

549
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,219
everything sucks. Anyway, speaking of everything sucks.

550
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,630
-- Uh, let's move on to our next story we want to talk about which
-- is 18

551
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,939
-- holes in them.
-- How exciting is that?

552
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:53,750
-- Well, it's, I'm not at all surprised because,
-- you know,

553
00:22:54,219 --> 00:22:54,709
the story.

554
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:56,339
So basically a little

555
00:22:56,479 --> 00:23:00,560
bit of back story ATM S fundamentally are a small

556
00:23:00,569 --> 00:23:04,219
computer running in the past OS two and now usually windows

557
00:23:04,739 --> 00:23:08,910
hooked up to a bunch of, you know, like a money counter, a money dispenser,

558
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,790
you know, the, the thing that, you know,

559
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,640
takes a picture of your checks when you show a check into it or whatever, you know,

560
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,800
just basically a

561
00:23:14,939 --> 00:23:17,030
bunch of USB peripherals really

562
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,829
or, you know, serial line peripherals even.

563
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:23,010
Um, so nothing, you know, it's basically just,

564
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,530
it's like a cash register point of sale system basically

565
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,530
really. It's nothing, it's not like some

566
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:31,650
super hardened, you know, system even software wise or whatever.

567
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,969
And so the deal is, um,

568
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:39,199
uh, like most computers, you know, if you can, like, talk to the computer directly,

569
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,510
you can ask it to do things like give me all your twenties.

570
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:45,709
-- But hey, these things are like in a physically secured case,
-- right?

571
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:47,150
You think so?

572
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:48,079
Because they're like

573
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:48,400
a

574
00:23:48,589 --> 00:23:49,780
lot of them are

575
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:53,609
like when I go to the bank, the ATM there is,

576
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:55,329
it's pretty hardcore man.

577
00:23:55,459 --> 00:23:57,969
However, if you go to the gas station

578
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:00,770
that ATM is slightly less hardcore and you can

579
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,099
see like the phone line draped over the lights,

580
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,410
you know, over to the other side.

581
00:24:04,469 --> 00:24:05,290
The other problem is

582
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:08,369
like USB, for example, has no concept of security.

583
00:24:08,859 --> 00:24:12,030
-- Right. Right.
-- The USB protocol has no concept of security.

584
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,050
So

585
00:24:13,209 --> 00:24:14,839
it wasn't even USB, was it? It was,

586
00:24:15,489 --> 00:24:16,349
-- I think,
-- yeah, exactly.

587
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:19,349
It was, it was because, you know, all that old money, like dispensers and stuff.

588
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,800
Yeah, they're cereal because why not?

589
00:24:20,979 --> 00:24:25,369
And so basically the deal is you drill a hole in the ATM, stick a wire in

590
00:24:25,719 --> 00:24:26,900
and, you know,

591
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:27,670
we connect

592
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:28,359
it up to the s

593
00:24:29,449 --> 00:24:29,530
and

594
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:30,900
sending commands.

595
00:24:30,939 --> 00:24:32,459
There's a port where they're,

596
00:24:32,469 --> 00:24:35,939
they're drilling the hole and they're plugging in a serial cable essentially

597
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:36,910
is what's happened

598
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,500
because I was reading one where they actually were just, like,

599
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:42,949
basically shoving their own wires into the serial thing.

600
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:44,280
That could be, that could be,

601
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:47,709
we'll assume there's some sort of port because plugging wire would

602
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:48,380
have

603
00:24:48,579 --> 00:24:48,589
a

604
00:24:48,699 --> 00:24:49,140
right.

605
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,719
-- Sure.
-- There's, you know,

606
00:24:51,459 --> 00:24:54,780
they're hooking up one computer up to another computer or serial

607
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,839
and then telling it to give them all the money.

608
00:24:56,849 --> 00:24:58,599
Right. I mean, that's basically what's happening.

609
00:24:59,219 --> 00:24:59,589
Yeah.

610
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,079
Yeah. And so, I mean, like, I think you pointed out that,

611
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:08,099
you know, uh, these things were really not designed with security in mind so much as,

612
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:11,050
like, well, it's sitting in a safe, you know, it's sitting in a physically safe,

613
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,500
secure process with people who can sort of keep an eye on it.

614
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:17,109
So, you know, hopefully if somebody goes up to it with like a power drill and some,

615
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:18,859
you know, box of tools, they're gonna be like,

616
00:25:19,229 --> 00:25:23,140
-- you don't look like Bob the repairman.
-- Well, I can see a couple of angles here.

617
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,260
So first of all,

618
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:28,739
someone designing this gear is probably not taking into account

619
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:32,000
somebody attacking it in that manner, right?

620
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:35,069
They're probably thinking direct theft of the machine.

621
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:38,130
So they make it heavy and they lock it down, you know, they, they chain it to things,

622
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:38,650
whatever

623
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:43,890
and you've got instances of people kind of hacking in remotely.

624
00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:44,959
But I think

625
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,369
the idea is there's a lock on the door

626
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,410
and people don't have access to the actual hardware.

627
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:54,469
And it's also quite likely that when it was designed a million years ago,

628
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:56,810
these devices were made of metal,

629
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,449
whereas now they're all plastic. In fact, you know what this reminds me of is,

630
00:26:00,849 --> 00:26:04,949
do you remember what people used to call the old pay phones back in the day?

631
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,880
The fortress phones. I

632
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:10,869
may have seen a few of them disassembled in various hacker cons and yeah,

633
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,819
those things were

634
00:26:11,959 --> 00:26:13,560
the amount of metal in those things were,

635
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,949
it was huge. Seriously.

636
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:18,160
Like you weren't getting in unless you physically remove the phone

637
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:20,589
and you had a long time to work on it.

638
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:22,349
Right. And, and that's the intent.

639
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,530
The intent wasn't to make it Impenetrable. It's to make it.

640
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:29,150
So it's not worth the, like, 20 bucks and quarters inside the thing.

641
00:26:29,709 --> 00:26:32,569
See, and here's so I just pulled up the Wikipedia page for ATM security.

642
00:26:32,579 --> 00:26:33,369
Here's the thing.

643
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,589
So they talk about security measures of ATM S.

644
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:38,630
They talk about online pin validation, offline pin validation, you know,

645
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,569
pin validation for blah, blah, blah,

646
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:41,510
um

647
00:26:41,699 --> 00:26:43,670
the hardware security module and the encryption.

648
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,750
But the thing is that all ignores the fact that for example,

649
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,510
if the cash dispenser talks, you know, is talked to over a serial line

650
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,400
and you can inject serial commands

651
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:56,109
unless that, you know, uh cash module is smart enough to like,

652
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,199
use an encrypted protocol which let's face

653
00:26:58,369 --> 00:26:58,500
-- it.
-- It's

654
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:58,949
not,

655
00:26:59,479 --> 00:27:00,699
it's absolutely not.

656
00:27:00,709 --> 00:27:03,550
You know, you can just basically tell the cash dispenser politely to like,

657
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,880
give me all your money,

658
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:07,030
all your, all your money. I belong to.

659
00:27:07,734 --> 00:27:11,484
I know what happened in one case where, um and there's been many articles, you know,

660
00:27:11,494 --> 00:27:14,694
where like some kids or somebody basically goes up to an ATM and uses the default,

661
00:27:14,954 --> 00:27:18,375
you know, service code of like, you know, 22894 or whatever the heck it is.

662
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:21,114
And, you know, and it puts the machine into, like, maintenance mode and they can,

663
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:22,125
like, monkey around with it.

664
00:27:22,545 --> 00:27:25,255
And what one enterprising person figured out was they,

665
00:27:25,265 --> 00:27:28,954
they would have it swap the two money, uh, bins

666
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:31,005
and it was like fives and twenties and they

667
00:27:31,015 --> 00:27:33,135
would swap it and then withdraw money and get,

668
00:27:33,145 --> 00:27:34,694
like, four times as much.

669
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:36,050
You

670
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,030
sure. Right.

671
00:27:39,109 --> 00:27:42,300
Um, because I know there's ATM S locally they'll dispense, you know, tens,

672
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:45,540
twenties and fifties and yeah, you swap the tens and fifties in the machine,

673
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,829
like mentally and like

674
00:27:47,239 --> 00:27:49,050
that's a, that's a pretty decent payout.

675
00:27:49,489 --> 00:27:51,430
Nice. Well, except, of course they know

676
00:27:51,589 --> 00:27:52,410
you took it out.

677
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,209
So

678
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,969
even, even if they can't prove you did it, you're

679
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:56,170
gonna

680
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:57,160
ask for their money

681
00:27:57,569 --> 00:27:58,170
when you're doing that,

682
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:02,260
somebody

683
00:28:02,439 --> 00:28:04,729
smart enough to do that is typically smart enough to also just

684
00:28:04,989 --> 00:28:05,949
somebody and like,

685
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:07,689
you know, they,

686
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:11,400
they recently raided a house, uh, in Edmonton here,

687
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:14,400
um, and arrested a bunch of people and they found

688
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:18,750
thousands of identities in the house and paperwork, stolen mail

689
00:28:18,859 --> 00:28:21,000
the whole nine yards. Like these people were just,

690
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:21,719
you know,

691
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:25,359
you know, I mean, for what it's worth though, in my brain,

692
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:29,439
this seems incredibly excessive is first hacking the ATM

693
00:28:29,739 --> 00:28:32,140
and then using stolen identities. It's just,

694
00:28:33,459 --> 00:28:36,959
if you have access to the identities, you're just gonna, you know, yank

695
00:28:37,369 --> 00:28:42,160
tons of money using the 45 stolen identities. You have, you're not gonna hack an ATM.

696
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:46,140
Well, alternatively, there are ATM S with maintenance modes that do involve like

697
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:47,709
there are

698
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:51,430
a maintenance mode that lets you withdraw all the cash is a,

699
00:28:51,719 --> 00:28:53,239
that's a broken ATM.

700
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,969
Well, you need to like, have it, be able to, you know,

701
00:28:55,979 --> 00:28:58,339
make sure the cash dispensing mechanism works

702
00:28:58,459 --> 00:29:00,180
without hooking it up to an account because, you know,

703
00:29:00,189 --> 00:29:02,114
obviously they're not gonna want to have to like, have the

704
00:29:02,244 --> 00:29:06,025
guy have a bank account with $1000 in it so he can dispense cash at an ATM.

705
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,864
And then at the end of the day, reconcile it. Right.

706
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:09,714
They're just gonna be like the manufacturers just gonna,

707
00:29:10,005 --> 00:29:11,395
you know, here's the magic

708
00:29:11,555 --> 00:29:12,625
code to make it work.

709
00:29:13,155 --> 00:29:13,175
I

710
00:29:13,474 --> 00:29:17,214
-- know how software gets built.
-- You're right, you're right. I know. I know. All right.

711
00:29:17,224 --> 00:29:19,675
So anyway, ATM S being stolen.

712
00:29:20,204 --> 00:29:20,234
Uh,

713
00:29:20,655 --> 00:29:20,785
yeah.

714
00:29:20,795 --> 00:29:22,604
Well, and what's happened locally, I mean, is people,

715
00:29:22,614 --> 00:29:24,084
especially in earlier area is just use a front,

716
00:29:24,094 --> 00:29:27,025
-- a stolen front end loader typically or a stolen pickup truck,
-- right?

717
00:29:27,035 --> 00:29:30,155
Put a chain around it and just take off with the ATM. And then,

718
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:31,540
you know,

719
00:29:31,989 --> 00:29:32,719
well, I mean,

720
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:36,520
that's probably more work than what these guys are doing with their computer,

721
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:40,119
but it also you, these are smart cookies obviously if they're doing it.

722
00:29:40,329 --> 00:29:40,760
So,

723
00:29:40,949 --> 00:29:41,089
yeah,

724
00:29:41,099 --> 00:29:43,469
driving a front end loader into an empty gas station

725
00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:45,599
and taking off with the ATM is not rocket science,

726
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:51,109
-- but you do need a front loader, which is not the easiest thing to come by.
-- Uh,

727
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,130
-- I'm sure
-- even,

728
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:57,489
even stealing a front loader cart isn't going to be a trivial task.

729
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:00,550
No. Well, you break into where the keys are stored on the construction site

730
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,109
-- and,
-- and,

731
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:05,290
ok, so here's one of the problems with a plausible attack is

732
00:30:05,619 --> 00:30:08,489
how many ans do you need to describe it?

733
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,880
And we're at about three at this point for your attack.

734
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:14,449
Whereas these guys, you just need a drill in a computer and you're good to go.

735
00:30:14,569 --> 00:30:14,750
But

736
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,630
you also need a level of expertise,

737
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,319
which is

738
00:30:19,334 --> 00:30:19,645
going to,

739
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:22,895
that is true. That is true. But even then, I mean, how

740
00:30:23,074 --> 00:30:24,364
much, how much money are in these?

741
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:27,854
ATM si mean, I think a couple of $1000 at the most, right.

742
00:30:27,864 --> 00:30:30,064
You're, these are people that I would think

743
00:30:30,275 --> 00:30:32,474
they could apply their skills in a non

744
00:30:32,574 --> 00:30:36,005
nefarious way and probably make way more money.

745
00:30:36,074 --> 00:30:39,984
I doubt that because how are they going to apply these skills to make money,

746
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:41,349
you pen

747
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:41,790
test

748
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:45,020
or become a great security researcher?

749
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:45,400
Yeah.

750
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:49,479
But the problem is these people are typically not living a lifestyle that involves,

751
00:30:49,489 --> 00:30:51,800
you know, regular hours and actually,

752
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,479
you know, being reliable.

753
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:54,430
Right.

754
00:30:54,439 --> 00:30:55,790
That's one of the things I've discovered with

755
00:30:55,819 --> 00:30:57,949
because that's something that keeps coming up is,

756
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:00,030
oh, you know, this guy is a great hacker.

757
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,660
He should be hired by the security companies.

758
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:03,650
And I'm like, well, maybe because you know,

759
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:06,219
I've met a lot of really great security researchers who are, like,

760
00:31:06,229 --> 00:31:07,630
awesome at security research,

761
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:10,390
but they really can't hold down a day job.

762
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:11,880
Yeah, that could be

763
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:13,880
-- part of it is just they get bored
-- or

764
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,729
they want to do what they want to do,

765
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:16,530
you know?

766
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:19,069
All right. Anyway, anyway. All right. So,

767
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:21,339
stealing from ATMs,

768
00:31:21,699 --> 00:31:24,449
there are atms that can hold up to 200 grand.

769
00:31:24,619 --> 00:31:26,319
That's solid man.

770
00:31:26,709 --> 00:31:27,170
That's,

771
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:32,339
uh, I'm not advocating robbing ATM S but like 200 grand.

772
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,329
Oh, no, no, no, sorry. That was a series of robberies that made off with 200 grand.

773
00:31:36,989 --> 00:31:39,329
Most machines contain less than 10 grand.

774
00:31:39,339 --> 00:31:41,609
That seems reasonable to me because it seems

775
00:31:41,619 --> 00:31:44,219
really dangerous to really load these suckers up

776
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:45,619
like a

777
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:49,579
major, like an ATM in a bank at a major, you know,

778
00:31:50,099 --> 00:31:51,449
that's totally different. And

779
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:55,130
-- that's not what this is. I suspect this is going to be like
-- gas gas stations.

780
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,439
Yep. Yep. Exactly.

781
00:31:57,709 --> 00:32:00,430
-- Well, and
-- there was that ATM fraud ring in, what was it?

782
00:32:00,729 --> 00:32:02,319
I want to say, Malaysia or whatever that, you know,

783
00:32:02,329 --> 00:32:05,589
withdrew like 20 some million dollars in a half hour period.

784
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:06,800
A few weeks ago,

785
00:32:07,489 --> 00:32:10,790
man. We got trace that down. But, yeah, I mean, like, like, so these are,

786
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,349
I mean, that, that is a sophisticated attack.

787
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:14,969
I mean, just getting that many people on the, you know,

788
00:32:14,979 --> 00:32:17,010
to get their watches synchronized alone is a,

789
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:20,439
well, you've tried scheduling meetings with 20 people.

790
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:22,000
Yeah.

791
00:32:22,349 --> 00:32:23,239
Well, yeah, it's,

792
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,349
it's impossible.

793
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:29,300
-- I wonder does the underworld use like Google calendar? I wonder, like, I
-- bet they do.

794
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:34,180
I, I think these guys use typical business tools way more than people think

795
00:32:34,439 --> 00:32:34,790
it's,

796
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,099
well, let's face it too. They're running a business.

797
00:32:37,109 --> 00:32:39,780
It might not be a legitimate business, but they're running a business.

798
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,300
This is true.

799
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,989
-- All right, let's, let's keep going, man. We all
-- right. You wanna talk?

800
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,609
Uh Well, this is something I really liked. Uh

801
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,300
the Japanese rail safety thing.

802
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:54,219
-- That is awesome, man. I really like that story.
-- So OK, I can't remember the name of it.

803
00:32:54,229 --> 00:32:56,209
Hang on a second. Let me pull up the uh

804
00:32:56,619 --> 00:33:00,099
-- uh does it have a name? I'm sure it does.
-- Yeah, there's like a Japanese name for it.

805
00:33:00,109 --> 00:33:02,099
So basically the idea is, is that,

806
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:06,729
you know, when you have people doing somewhat routine tasks, they tend to, you know,

807
00:33:06,739 --> 00:33:09,060
get bored or skip them or do them improperly, right?

808
00:33:09,069 --> 00:33:10,420
Cause you know, humans are human

809
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:11,810
really.

810
00:33:12,069 --> 00:33:16,219
And the problem is though is when it's like part of a safety system like like trains,

811
00:33:16,229 --> 00:33:19,739
you know, you, you skip a step or two, somebody else skips a step or two.

812
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,300
And then the third guy who was supposed to just absolutely make sure

813
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:25,140
nobody's like on the tracks when the train pulls into the station,

814
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,660
you know, decides to go to the bathroom instead of doing his job.

815
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:30,290
And you know, some poor guy gets smooshed by a train or whatever

816
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:31,469
or

817
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:33,920
derailing whatever. I found the name. It's called uh

818
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,530
Shish

819
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:34,930
Shisha

820
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,670
Kenko S A

821
00:33:36,925 --> 00:33:41,555
Isa Kanko. So for any Japanese people listening, I

822
00:33:42,494 --> 00:33:43,145
for

823
00:33:43,395 --> 00:33:45,094
horribly mispronouncing

824
00:33:46,425 --> 00:33:46,665
it,

825
00:33:46,994 --> 00:33:48,364
it's pointing and calling.

826
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:51,385
So for example, when the guy has to check the speed of the train rather than, you know,

827
00:33:51,395 --> 00:33:53,885
like he has a check to say like check the speed of the train,

828
00:33:53,895 --> 00:33:55,655
make sure it's like whatever the speed should be.

829
00:33:55,685 --> 00:33:58,775
He actually not only calls out what the speed should be like,

830
00:33:58,785 --> 00:34:01,464
say 80 kilometers an hour, but he points at the gauge,

831
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,000
right? And they showed a guy, uh

832
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:09,100
I think a station master anyways, a guy who on the side of the, of the um the platform,

833
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,780
you know, checking

834
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:13,580
the tracks to make sure they're clear before the train comes into the station.

835
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:14,320
And he like,

836
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:18,060
looks up and down the tracks and like swings his hand and follows his finger,

837
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,219
right.

838
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:21,659
Which, and I've, you know, it's so it

839
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:28,070
-- apparently reduced their human error rate by 85%.
-- I totally believe that, you know,

840
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:31,159
and what really gets me though is so

841
00:34:31,629 --> 00:34:35,629
uh somebody from the uh from the New York mt A went and saw this and was like,

842
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,320
this is awesome.

843
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:40,438
Brought it, tried to bring it back to New York and it's like

844
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,649
the American workers didn't really want to do it because they felt it was like,

845
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:44,770
silly or something.

846
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:48,290
And, and it's funny because the Japanese response is, this is not silly.

847
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,719
This is like safety. So, of course you would, would, you would do it.

848
00:34:50,728 --> 00:34:55,918
And as an infosec guy, I'm like, if it reduces error rates by 85% and is like simple,

849
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:56,340
like,

850
00:34:56,668 --> 00:34:57,600
oh yeah, we're doing it.

851
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,300
I, well, yeah, you say that except

852
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:02,560
infosec is like a total disaster.

853
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:03,389
-- We
-- don't have.

854
00:35:03,939 --> 00:35:08,459
And part of the problem though is we don't have reproducibility and we don't have,

855
00:35:08,469 --> 00:35:09,060
I mean, let's face it.

856
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:11,469
What this really is is pointing and saying

857
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,939
you now have essentially triple redundancy error checking.

858
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:14,709
That's what it is,

859
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:15,229
right?

860
00:35:15,469 --> 00:35:19,870
And like in our case for security, we have uh like zero error checking in most cases.

861
00:35:19,879 --> 00:35:23,590
So, so II I get this right.

862
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,709
I can see a couple of huge advantages to this is first of all,

863
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:29,899
you have the muscle memory aspect of doing something where

864
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:33,669
if you, if you do a certain thing like as a human

865
00:35:33,919 --> 00:35:36,699
over and over again, you get kind of the muscle memory.

866
00:35:36,709 --> 00:35:40,179
So you if you do one thing, you expect to do another thing after that.

867
00:35:40,189 --> 00:35:42,899
And so obviously, if it's time to check the, the speed

868
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,139
and you point

869
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:45,540
you get that

870
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:45,899
it,

871
00:35:45,909 --> 00:35:47,909
it's just something that you keep doing

872
00:35:47,919 --> 00:35:49,989
automatically without even thinking about after a

873
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,739
while and then obviously speaking it as

874
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,699
well just helps to reinforce what you're doing

875
00:35:53,929 --> 00:35:58,189
because like you said, humans suck at doing things that are boring and routine.

876
00:35:58,439 --> 00:35:59,159
-- It,
-- it's kind of

877
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,199
like when I go to lock the, when I go to make sure the doors are locked at night,

878
00:36:02,209 --> 00:36:03,830
I actually go up to the door and

879
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,469
even if it is locked,

880
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:09,229
I do exactly the same thing because,

881
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:09,750
yeah.

882
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,110
Yeah, I've,

883
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,350
I've had many instances where I thought it was locked or I forgot whatever.

884
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,270
Right. And, yeah, absolutely. I totally get this man.

885
00:36:16,989 --> 00:36:17,449
It's,

886
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,580
I, you know what else?

887
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:23,219
I'm, I'm really sensitive to about this is I think about people,

888
00:36:23,229 --> 00:36:26,739
I used to know whose job was reading I DS logs,

889
00:36:27,379 --> 00:36:30,669
right? And that's something like literally after five minutes you're worthless.

890
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,169
-- It's
-- more like a punishment than

891
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:32,320
a

892
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:35,449
-- job.
-- It was a job, it was a real job. It was,

893
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:35,820
it was

894
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:36,750
people

895
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,659
and, and right, like this is totally one of those things like

896
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:42,169
not that I'm advocating.

897
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:45,070
You should let people look at your logs point at them and then read them or something.

898
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,439
But you know, it's by,

899
00:36:46,449 --> 00:36:48,909
by not just doing the same repetitive task over and

900
00:36:48,919 --> 00:36:51,800
over again and adding in a little bit of change.

901
00:36:52,139 --> 00:36:57,399
You, you don't fall into that trap of just blur, right? This, this is awesome, man.

902
00:36:57,409 --> 00:36:58,580
I love this and,

903
00:36:58,689 --> 00:37:03,040
and part of me has been thinking now, like, how can infosec do something like this

904
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:06,840
in theory? We are sort of, you know, code reviews, right?

905
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:10,000
You can't check your code in until it undergoes a code review by a second person.

906
00:37:10,139 --> 00:37:11,989
But like how many of those are really actually

907
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,090
reading the code versus like skimming it and clicking?

908
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,219
Ok, because they just

909
00:37:15,389 --> 00:37:17,010
are hungry and want to go eat lunch.

910
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:21,729
-- I'm sure you get plenty of that. It's maybe, maybe I should point at the
-- code by

911
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:25,780
definition, all these companies that do code reviews and still have CV ES like,

912
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:27,159
obviously it's not 100%.

913
00:37:27,169 --> 00:37:27,330
And

914
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:27,790
my,

915
00:37:28,399 --> 00:37:28,580
my

916
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:32,110
question would be well and do does, here's my one thought,

917
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,030
does anybody actually keep actual proper statistics?

918
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,189
Like, for example, do they have a code review process that also involves, you know,

919
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:40,050
I found an actual flaw in the code review.

920
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,610
So I'm gonna file a bug and then we'll close it

921
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,889
as fixed and we'll actually track it as a security issue

922
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:44,580
and the answer

923
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:44,929
is

924
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:45,360
no,

925
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,340
-- nobody
-- does
-- too

926
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:46,850
much.

927
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,350
You know, we might be able to do this because with

928
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,199
you can download

929
00:37:51,919 --> 00:37:53,669
various information

930
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,110
and we could do some analysis of that,

931
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:59,070
but you'd have to have somebody basically audit, not just the code,

932
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,409
but audit all the commits

933
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,919
the level of expertise and effort involved in that.

934
00:38:03,379 --> 00:38:06,550
-- You know, I'm going to think about this. I bet we could do this stupid
-- question.

935
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,189
Could something like co

936
00:38:07,479 --> 00:38:13,159
-- scanner do this?
-- I know I'm more thinking we could we to download the data,

937
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:17,639
we would need a way to identify a CV E to a specific patch

938
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,800
which kids a little, it's not impossible.

939
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:20,929
But I'm talking about the things where the

940
00:38:20,939 --> 00:38:23,070
code commit actually caught a security flaw.

941
00:38:23,489 --> 00:38:23,580
I

942
00:38:23,729 --> 00:38:24,110
see what you're saying.

943
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,909
And then they were like, oh your, your, your code commit is bad, go fix it

944
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:32,050
-- and they come back with a fixed one. How often does that happen?
-- I bet. Not very often.

945
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:37,510
Well, well, let's face it too. How many, how many security reviewers are security?

946
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,050
I'm sorry, how many code reviewers are security people?

947
00:38:40,189 --> 00:38:41,510
I bet the number is very low.

948
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:46,280
Well, in theory, I mean, it should be about code correctness because in theory,

949
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,189
if the code is correct and of course,

950
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:51,919
this also assumes that like the logic and the intent of the code is correct, right?

951
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:54,979
Because I've seen code that's correct, but it implemented like the wrong thing

952
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:55,689
and

953
00:38:55,879 --> 00:38:56,659
you know, all the time

954
00:38:56,909 --> 00:39:00,030
or like, you know, like the downgrade specification in in you know, very soon

955
00:39:00,155 --> 00:39:03,314
description protocols where it's like we've now discovered like, yeah, we're,

956
00:39:03,324 --> 00:39:07,235
we're removing that in TLS 1.3 because like downloading is a bad idea.

957
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:08,655
It's a terrible idea.

958
00:39:08,665 --> 00:39:09,425
-- I know
-- but you know,

959
00:39:09,435 --> 00:39:12,975
from a backwards compatibility and like making all this junk work together.

960
00:39:12,985 --> 00:39:14,254
Yeah. No, it made sense

961
00:39:14,544 --> 00:39:17,074
-- back in the day.
-- Backwards compatibility is terrible.

962
00:39:17,645 --> 00:39:17,935
Yeah,

963
00:39:18,385 --> 00:39:18,875
so,

964
00:39:20,209 --> 00:39:23,979
well, I mean, speaking of TL so I just ran into something today that's kind of cute,

965
00:39:23,989 --> 00:39:24,409
but

966
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,070
I think basically useless.

967
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:29,229
Um So the idea is you have certificate,

968
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:31,840
authorities who issue certificates and some of them

969
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:34,739
have a bad habit of issuing certificates to

970
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:38,850
some people who are, maybe not who they say they are.

971
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,939
-- All of
-- them not saying any names like

972
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:41,709
Symantec, like

973
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:42,620
all of them.

974
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,020
It's not just them, they just

975
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:49,245
repeatedly. This is like, I love it when someone gets caught cheating in sports.

976
00:39:49,254 --> 00:39:52,955
It's like, no, they all do it. It's like this guy just got caught, you know.

977
00:39:53,814 --> 00:39:56,044
Um, so anyways, there's this, uh, uh,

978
00:39:56,074 --> 00:39:58,955
this thing called DNS certificate Authority Authorization.

979
00:39:58,965 --> 00:40:01,324
And the idea is you have a record called CAA

980
00:40:01,655 --> 00:40:03,445
the certificate, authority authorization.

981
00:40:03,804 --> 00:40:08,165
And it essentially contains information on a list of,

982
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:08,739
and

983
00:40:08,889 --> 00:40:09,530
-- this
-- is

984
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:10,889
your

985
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:11,199
DN,

986
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,030
your DNS.

987
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:12,820
Yeah, for like,

988
00:40:13,129 --> 00:40:13,679
do or whatever.

989
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:16,100
And so the idea being that you list,

990
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,909
which CAS are allowed to assign certificates for you.

991
00:40:18,919 --> 00:40:20,520
So, like, lets and crypt.org or

992
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:21,729
I guess,

993
00:40:21,929 --> 00:40:23,120
verisign.com or whatever,

994
00:40:23,429 --> 00:40:29,010
um, what they're sort of, uh, allowed to, like, can they, uh, issue for, like,

995
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:32,510
just the specific name or can they, like, issue wild card certificates?

996
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,939
Right. Because, you know, one challenge is if, you know,

997
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:37,840
you get a wild card certificate, then you can do whatever you want.

998
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:39,830
And some people don't want any wild card

999
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,310
certificates being associated with their domain at all,

1000
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,379
even legitimately

1001
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:43,870
because it

1002
00:40:43,979 --> 00:40:44,040
just,

1003
00:40:44,389 --> 00:40:44,860
it, problems.

1004
00:40:45,399 --> 00:40:47,989
Here's what makes this hilarious.

1005
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,510
I bet if you went to any medium to large sized organization

1006
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:53,510
and said,

1007
00:40:53,629 --> 00:40:55,469
how many certificates

1008
00:40:55,689 --> 00:40:56,629
do you have?

1009
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:00,189
They would be off by a magnitude

1010
00:41:00,409 --> 00:41:02,790
because they have no idea.

1011
00:41:04,399 --> 00:41:05,659
Yeah. Well, I mean, with the waste cert,

1012
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,729
well, so for even

1013
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,739
so for domain validated certificates, yeah.

1014
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:13,080
Anybody who controls that domain can get a certificate.

1015
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:13,689
Right.

1016
00:41:13,909 --> 00:41:16,219
Because you, you just do an email check or you do a, a

1017
00:41:16,449 --> 00:41:20,070
DNS based check or whatever and boom, you know, you, you got a certificate,

1018
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:23,090
um even something like extended validation.

1019
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,860
I mean, you're just submitting business records and stuff and I mean,

1020
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:31,370
I, yeah, a large company isn't gonna have like a single point who can only do that?

1021
00:41:31,379 --> 00:41:33,179
Like anybody can get a hold of those, you know,

1022
00:41:33,189 --> 00:41:35,260
what is it done in Bradstreet or whatever,

1023
00:41:35,449 --> 00:41:37,500
you know, agency they're getting the records from.

1024
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,679
But what makes it even more hilarious and terrible

1025
00:41:40,709 --> 00:41:44,439
is that for this to actually work every single certificate

1026
00:41:44,449 --> 00:41:47,790
authority would have to check for this record every

1027
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,860
single time they issue a certificate to a domain?

1028
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:50,959
That's true, I suppose

1029
00:41:51,189 --> 00:41:51,510
because

1030
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,729
we have it

1031
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,020
well, and then, then,

1032
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:57,659
then there's the question of does the record not

1033
00:41:57,669 --> 00:41:59,419
exist or are we being man in the middle?

1034
00:42:01,479 --> 00:42:02,070
Right. So,

1035
00:42:05,169 --> 00:42:05,860
so for now,

1036
00:42:06,139 --> 00:42:10,169
so that means you need DNS Sec to get a signed nex domain saying, oh no,

1037
00:42:10,179 --> 00:42:12,229
there is legitimately no record of this.

1038
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:13,649
Cool. Right. Let's go.

1039
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:14,709
Um

1040
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:18,409
And then the best part too is uh, so currently of the, apparently Alexa

1041
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:22,129
top 1 million websites. 300 of them have this record.

1042
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,040
A CAA record.

1043
00:42:24,389 --> 00:42:24,810
Yeah.

1044
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:25,739
Really?

1045
00:42:26,189 --> 00:42:26,459
Yeah.

1046
00:42:26,469 --> 00:42:29,100
Well, but, I mean, you know, because there's a couple of crazy people in there, like,

1047
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:31,939
I mean, look at the, look at the HSTS white list.

1048
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:34,239
Right. And there's people like me in there from, like, years ago. Right.

1049
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:35,620
There's always a bunch of crazies.

1050
00:42:36,229 --> 00:42:36,780
Um,

1051
00:42:37,949 --> 00:42:39,800
and so, um,

1052
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:42,830
you know, the problem is though, is that,

1053
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:44,330
uh,

1054
00:42:44,459 --> 00:42:48,409
some C A support this and there's a list here. But it's like, uh, it's like a dozen

1055
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:49,969
and here's the best part.

1056
00:42:49,979 --> 00:42:53,030
It's like, we don't even know globally how many certificate authorities there are.

1057
00:42:54,179 --> 00:42:55,340
Well, no, because for example,

1058
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:58,300
I use cheap SSL s.com when I have to buy wild card certificates

1059
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:02,719
because they're well cheap and they sell SSL certificates cheap SSL S,

1060
00:43:02,729 --> 00:43:03,120
you know,

1061
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,820
and they're terrible and they use like Godaddy

1062
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:07,469
and Komodo and a bunch of other certificates.

1063
00:43:07,479 --> 00:43:10,610
So they, they don't have their own certificate to the best of my knowledge.

1064
00:43:10,729 --> 00:43:12,760
They piggyback on all these other providers

1065
00:43:13,919 --> 00:43:16,870
and, you know, so is cheap. SSL S AC A Well,

1066
00:43:17,419 --> 00:43:21,320
yes. Yes. And are they using CAS that check C A records?

1067
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:22,659
Well, I think some of them do and

1068
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:24,370
do all of them. I don't know.

1069
00:43:24,649 --> 00:43:26,350
So, like if you look at all the root cas,

1070
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,379
all the root CAS would have to be doing this and there's like, what, 200 of them

1071
00:43:30,659 --> 00:43:31,409
in your browser.

1072
00:43:31,929 --> 00:43:32,570
Uh

1073
00:43:32,699 --> 00:43:34,699
-- Yeah, there's a lot
-- more than 100 and,

1074
00:43:34,709 --> 00:43:34,989
and, oh,

1075
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:39,250
man, the ca, I guess here's the thing. I always come back to

1076
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:42,870
the C A model is a disaster

1077
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,590
but the world is functioning

1078
00:43:45,739 --> 00:43:46,340
so

1079
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:50,270
well. I think it's terrible because I kind of understand how it works.

1080
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,929
Like, fundamentally at the end of the day

1081
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,060
it's basically doing what it's supposed to do.

1082
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:55,739
Right.

1083
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:56,300
And

1084
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:56,780
it,

1085
00:43:57,919 --> 00:43:57,939
you

1086
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:58,860
-- know what it's supposed to
-- do

1087
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:02,739
whatever the world works. Kurt, you can go to Amazon and buy stuff.

1088
00:44:02,969 --> 00:44:03,139
I'm

1089
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:03,280
not

1090
00:44:03,489 --> 00:44:06,090
NTCA. I think the whole thing is a train wreck of,

1091
00:44:06,229 --> 00:44:08,610
you know, amazing proportions. But fundamentally, it's,

1092
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:09,580
it's,

1093
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:11,899
I, I'm just not really clear on what I mean,

1094
00:44:11,909 --> 00:44:15,590
I think we need to have this stuff encrypted and we need to have this to some level of,

1095
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,250
you know, validation.

1096
00:44:17,189 --> 00:44:17,939
You know what this is?

1097
00:44:17,949 --> 00:44:21,699
Did you ever see the episode of The Simpsons where Mr Burns had like every disease,

1098
00:44:21,709 --> 00:44:23,050
which is why he wasn't dead.

1099
00:44:24,179 --> 00:44:25,350
Right. That's what this is.

1100
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:28,520
Everything that could be wrong is wrong,

1101
00:44:28,689 --> 00:44:32,679
but it works because everything is so broken all at the same time.

1102
00:44:32,739 --> 00:44:35,139
And like, that's all I keep thinking of is CAS is.

1103
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:36,129
But

1104
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:40,969
if any security person, like sat down and wrote down how the C A system works today,

1105
00:44:40,979 --> 00:44:43,209
we'd be like, there's no way this could work.

1106
00:44:43,219 --> 00:44:43,729
There's no

1107
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:44,010
way

1108
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:45,330
I wrote,

1109
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:48,280
I wrote an article about this back in like 2001, you know,

1110
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:51,360
the death of SSL and SSH and I got death threats

1111
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,340
uh for it. Um It was when D sniff came out right back in the day. Remember D Sniff.

1112
00:44:57,629 --> 00:44:58,570
Uh Anyways,

1113
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:00,360
one of the Netscape engineers emailed me.

1114
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:03,689
He was like, yeah, no, like if we had half a clue that this thing would have, you know,

1115
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:07,439
been used the way it was, we would not have designed it this way because we literally,

1116
00:45:07,449 --> 00:45:09,889
our mandate was to make it safe to use credit cards online.

1117
00:45:09,979 --> 00:45:10,570
That was it,

1118
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:11,760
right.

1119
00:45:11,949 --> 00:45:16,330
And then now TLS and SSL is like, well, if you have to encrypt on the wire,

1120
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,360
that's how you do it,

1121
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,479
you know.

1122
00:45:18,959 --> 00:45:23,439
And so there's like fundamental design choices that were made that are just not

1123
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,179
so good anymore.

1124
00:45:25,429 --> 00:45:29,899
2530 years later, like who knew 30 year old design choices, you know,

1125
00:45:29,909 --> 00:45:31,620
sometimes bite you in the butt.

1126
00:45:32,419 --> 00:45:32,659
Yeah.

1127
00:45:32,959 --> 00:45:33,419
Yeah. Yeah,

1128
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:34,780
-- it's,
-- you know, and

1129
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:35,899
so, I mean, it's,

1130
00:45:35,909 --> 00:45:38,409
it's definitely better than just having everything clear text and like,

1131
00:45:38,419 --> 00:45:40,060
especially now with Wi Fi networks

1132
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:41,729
like good Lord, you know,

1133
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,409
well, that kind of brings up to an issue.

1134
00:45:44,419 --> 00:45:45,399
We didn't put on the show notes,

1135
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:48,889
but the whole apparently so um as well for those

1136
00:45:48,899 --> 00:45:51,239
of you who live in caves with slow internet,

1137
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,889
um your ISP if you're in the US is now able to sell your information,

1138
00:45:55,659 --> 00:45:57,479
you like browsing history and stuff.

1139
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:58,909
And so this has led

1140
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:02,040
to a plethora of fake VPN stuff.

1141
00:46:03,449 --> 00:46:03,850
The bad guys

1142
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:04,360
on

1143
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:06,530
-- there.
-- It's not,

1144
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:10,419
I think because in fact, there was a report came out,

1145
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:11,790
man, when was this?

1146
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,250
This was a couple of months ago talking about all the

1147
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:17,659
Android VPN apps and a significant number of them were fake.

1148
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,100
-- You know, it's,
-- I

1149
00:46:19,239 --> 00:46:21,070
mean, I was talking about VPN providers but

1150
00:46:21,469 --> 00:46:24,530
no, no, I know same deal though. I mean, it's basically the same idea. Right.

1151
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,850
Where these, well, it's meant to be like,

1152
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:31,020
download this VPN app and we'll secure all your traffic using our secure VPN server.

1153
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:31,250
Right?

1154
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:31,760
And of course,

1155
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:34,239
it doesn't do anything and they charge you like five bucks or whatever and,

1156
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,959
and it's not like most people have no way to verify this stuff.

1157
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:40,709
-- So, how would they,
-- well, yeah, you'd have to be using like Wi Fi and sniffing it,

1158
00:46:40,889 --> 00:46:41,439
which

1159
00:46:42,169 --> 00:46:42,629
it's,

1160
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:43,540
you know,

1161
00:46:44,629 --> 00:46:49,669
well, but here's ok. So here's the thing, right? We tie this back to the ATM story is,

1162
00:46:49,919 --> 00:46:52,080
criminals are very opportunistic.

1163
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,409
And if we look at it from a very business point of view,

1164
00:46:55,689 --> 00:46:57,090
there is a problem

1165
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,010
that needs a solution

1166
00:46:59,290 --> 00:46:59,669
be it.

1167
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:03,510
People are scared their ISP is going to sell their data,

1168
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,610
which I'm sure they were doing anyway, just calling it something else, whatever

1169
00:47:06,899 --> 00:47:07,820
-- they were doing,
-- it aggregated

1170
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:08,550
in.

1171
00:47:08,689 --> 00:47:10,750
-- Yeah, I know. I mean,
-- how do you think we get traffic data

1172
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:11,639
from

1173
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:11,810
cell

1174
00:47:11,969 --> 00:47:12,060
phone?

1175
00:47:12,439 --> 00:47:14,510
I know. I know. But anyway. Anyway,

1176
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:15,360
so

1177
00:47:15,939 --> 00:47:18,439
people are, are worried, they, they hear about VPN S,

1178
00:47:18,449 --> 00:47:21,709
they read about it in the newspaper or whatever the neighbor kid told them.

1179
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:25,750
Now, they, they, they probably just type in, like VPN service into Google

1180
00:47:26,179 --> 00:47:28,520
and they're gonna click the first link. It's like the,

1181
00:47:28,649 --> 00:47:29,280
my,

1182
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:31,360
my parents' neighbor who typed in, you know,

1183
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:33,840
cannon printers.com that I'll go there.

1184
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:34,550
That looks neat.

1185
00:47:34,979 --> 00:47:35,429
And like,

1186
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:35,750
what's the

1187
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,209
poor guy supposed to search for? And cannon

1188
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:37,889
printers.com

1189
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:39,399
looks legit. I mean, how are you supposed to do?

1190
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,979
But to him it looks legit.

1191
00:47:43,489 --> 00:47:46,159
All right, maybe whatever, whatever the point being,

1192
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:48,909
-- these people, I've
-- actually got worse news for you.

1193
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,300
So I have a block running but I typed in VPN link in Google.

1194
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:55,459
First result is the Wikipedia entry followed by a link to open VPN,

1195
00:47:55,469 --> 00:47:57,810
followed by how to connect to a VPN Windows, followed by a

1196
00:47:58,219 --> 00:48:00,750
VPN at us. Cd.edu.

1197
00:48:00,929 --> 00:48:02,080
Like how to

1198
00:48:02,449 --> 00:48:06,080
follow by private internet access, anonymous VPN service from the leaders.

1199
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:09,000
So it's just like somebody normal types this in and

1200
00:48:09,699 --> 00:48:11,399
they're gonna have to go to the ads because

1201
00:48:11,409 --> 00:48:13,969
the actual links that Google is finding me are,

1202
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,080
you know, they click on open vpn.net and they're gonna get

1203
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:20,100
um, something that makes no sense to them. Really?

1204
00:48:21,489 --> 00:48:25,270
I know, I mean, oh, open VPN, like, I love it to death, but it's

1205
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,000
a normal person. Probably can't even

1206
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,090
understand what it's supposed to be.

1207
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:30,750
The,

1208
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,899
a lot of the providers now have an installer wrapped

1209
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:35,979
around it and they use like certificate based authentication.

1210
00:48:35,989 --> 00:48:38,830
So they wrap the installer. You get your cert boom, it just works.

1211
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:39,979
Yep.

1212
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:40,810
Yep. You know,

1213
00:48:41,149 --> 00:48:43,939
so there is some hope but the problem is how do you know you're using a legit?

1214
00:48:43,949 --> 00:48:45,860
Like, and, and for you and I, why,

1215
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:48,199
why do we say open vpn.net is legitimate

1216
00:48:48,209 --> 00:48:52,209
and like super open vpn.ru is not legitimate?

1217
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:54,260
You know what I mean? Like, seriously, right? Like

1218
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:59,120
the only reason I'm saying open VPN is legit is because it's got that like open

1219
00:48:59,419 --> 00:49:02,850
open VPN logo, which is pretty and I've seen it before.

1220
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:05,469
We know the people who work on this stuff. I mean,

1221
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:05,909
that's how

1222
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:06,620
we know it's

1223
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:09,709
open VPN. This is open VPN, the service,

1224
00:49:10,229 --> 00:49:10,370
there's

1225
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:10,800
open,

1226
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,070
what is this

1227
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:13,419
open VPN technologies? Inc

1228
00:49:14,419 --> 00:49:14,810
VPN

1229
00:49:14,979 --> 00:49:15,010
dot

1230
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:19,209
So there's the, there's the open source software like which is open vpn.org.

1231
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:21,969
There's open vpn.net, which is

1232
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:25,129
one of the few times I've seen a person using the.net legit.

1233
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:25,669
See

1234
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:26,959
what this is

1235
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:27,879
interesting.

1236
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:32,360
I, I have never noticed this before. I would assume this is dodgy for what it's worth.

1237
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:36,159
-- I would not trust this in a million years.
-- Well, I don't know who these people are.

1238
00:49:36,169 --> 00:49:38,199
They, they seem to be affiliated with Open VPN.

1239
00:49:38,699 --> 00:49:39,639
They stole the logo.

1240
00:49:39,959 --> 00:49:40,149
I,

1241
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:40,570
I

1242
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:41,639
have no

1243
00:49:41,939 --> 00:49:44,719
idea. I would assume they stole the logo. I would not trust this.

1244
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:48,969
-- I think
-- they're legit, but I seem to remember looking into them a while back.

1245
00:49:48,979 --> 00:49:49,989
But anyways, that's the point.

1246
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,409
We're security researchers who, like,

1247
00:49:51,419 --> 00:49:53,939
actually have talked to the people who work on open VPN.

1248
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,840
I don't even know.

1249
00:49:54,949 --> 00:49:55,449
I

1250
00:49:55,699 --> 00:49:56,699
would not trust this.

1251
00:49:57,949 --> 00:49:59,590
Well, who would you trust then? Right.

1252
00:49:59,919 --> 00:50:02,479
I trust I predator who are the Pirate Bay guys that

1253
00:50:02,489 --> 00:50:05,169
run the VPN because I'm confident if anyone's gonna give the f

1254
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:07,620
to the authorities, like it's those guys

1255
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:08,959
that's fair

1256
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:11,050
and, and in all seriousness, I would

1257
00:50:11,189 --> 00:50:12,219
be very, I,

1258
00:50:12,229 --> 00:50:15,949
I'm very hesitant to trust VPN providers because I know the vast majority of them.

1259
00:50:15,959 --> 00:50:16,780
Let's face it. If the n

1260
00:50:16,975 --> 00:50:18,975
he shows up at their door, they're gonna be like, do whatever you want,

1261
00:50:18,985 --> 00:50:19,774
just don't arrest me.

1262
00:50:19,784 --> 00:50:21,995
Right? Like that's the reality of it. And,

1263
00:50:22,425 --> 00:50:23,344
and granted,

1264
00:50:23,614 --> 00:50:26,635
in my case that that isn't really a threat I'm concerned about,

1265
00:50:26,645 --> 00:50:28,395
but you get the idea is,

1266
00:50:29,104 --> 00:50:31,905
well, I've always wondered, you know, are these VPN providers, for example,

1267
00:50:31,915 --> 00:50:35,875
just opportunistically sniffing on encrypted web traffic looking for

1268
00:50:36,294 --> 00:50:38,554
-- sensitive stuff.
-- I'm sure some are, I'm sure.

1269
00:50:38,564 --> 00:50:41,544
Well, I'm sure some of them mine your data and they sell it

1270
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:42,510
right.

1271
00:50:42,699 --> 00:50:45,169
Like I have no doubt that is happening in,

1272
00:50:45,179 --> 00:50:47,850
in some of those instances and there is no way

1273
00:50:47,979 --> 00:50:48,689
you will know.

1274
00:50:49,229 --> 00:50:52,290
Yeah, I think fundamentally what has to happen is we have to,

1275
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,540
as much as I had to say is we have to get, you know,

1276
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:56,159
everybody has to get certificates and we have to

1277
00:50:56,169 --> 00:50:58,810
encrypt all the traffic as much as possible because

1278
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:04,709
let's face it like the, the pretty much all the network traffic now is over is the web,

1279
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:06,000
there's a

1280
00:51:06,169 --> 00:51:08,300
-- bunch of other
-- protocols, but basically it's the web.

1281
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:09,669
That's how people interact with

1282
00:51:09,919 --> 00:51:11,939
-- stuff.
-- It's beyond court, man.

1283
00:51:11,949 --> 00:51:12,379
I mean,

1284
00:51:12,389 --> 00:51:14,739
I think Google has the right view here of that

1285
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:17,870
zero trust networking where you cannot trust the network.

1286
00:51:17,879 --> 00:51:21,629
Even if you own the piece of wire running between the gears,

1287
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:26,469
you can't trust it, just don't do it, encrypt it all. It's the only way to go, man.

1288
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:27,449
I, I agree

1289
00:51:27,699 --> 00:51:29,159
100%. And

1290
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:31,719
granted that's easy to say because it's not

1291
00:51:31,729 --> 00:51:33,510
something that's going to just magically happen.

1292
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:37,300
-- At
-- least it's possible now, like, you know, all the CP US have AES, you know, crypto

1293
00:51:37,439 --> 00:51:40,489
capabilities where, you know, back in the day, remember like Aes,

1294
00:51:40,939 --> 00:51:43,000
you were lucky to get a couple of megabits.

1295
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,810
Do you remember all the crypto

1296
00:51:44,959 --> 00:51:46,330
accelerators that used to be able to get?

1297
00:51:47,189 --> 00:51:48,320
They were terrible.

1298
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:51,080
They were super expensive and they all suck too like they,

1299
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:54,199
they were hard to use and they were, they were super fragile and, and they,

1300
00:51:54,209 --> 00:51:55,120
they never worked, right.

1301
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:55,949
But

1302
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:56,199
yeah,

1303
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:57,250
to your

1304
00:51:57,389 --> 00:51:58,100
stuff, I mean,

1305
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:01,909
you know, f five used to be able to charge whatever the heck they wanted,

1306
00:52:02,179 --> 00:52:03,739
right? Because what else were you going to do?

1307
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,639
Like, literally you have no choice unless you were some crazy guy who like,

1308
00:52:06,649 --> 00:52:07,250
set up a bunch of

1309
00:52:07,379 --> 00:52:08,199
PC,

1310
00:52:09,399 --> 00:52:10,050
you know, like

1311
00:52:10,649 --> 00:52:10,719
that

1312
00:52:11,189 --> 00:52:12,590
like that around here.

1313
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:13,260
Yeah, I

1314
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:13,610
know,

1315
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:14,750
man. I know.

1316
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:17,870
Although I must admit that these, this stuff is super cool.

1317
00:52:17,879 --> 00:52:19,949
I remember playing with some of this gear once and,

1318
00:52:19,959 --> 00:52:22,379
and doing like various tests where you do, you know,

1319
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,629
like as many connections as fast as you could

1320
00:52:24,739 --> 00:52:25,250
to,

1321
00:52:25,389 --> 00:52:28,209
to, you know, an SS A, it was SSL back then and,

1322
00:52:28,219 --> 00:52:32,189
and SSL enabled web server and like you turn it off and you'd get, you know, maybe,

1323
00:52:32,219 --> 00:52:35,979
maybe a couple of 1000 if you were lucky and you turn that sucker on and it was like the,

1324
00:52:35,989 --> 00:52:38,810
the machine sending the request, couldn't send them fast enough.

1325
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:39,929
It was amazing.

1326
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:45,520
Yeah. No, it's, uh, the times are changing. I mean, it's, that's

1327
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:46,919
what really gets me now is, you know,

1328
00:52:46,929 --> 00:52:49,159
we're at the point where like a standard one U

1329
00:52:49,169 --> 00:52:52,719
rack mount can easily saturate 10 or 40 gigabytes.

1330
00:52:52,729 --> 00:52:53,419
No problem.

1331
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:54,000
Yeah. Yeah.

1332
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:58,479
Well, you know, I guess part of it too, this comes back to the whole space race concept

1333
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:01,580
from way back when is just because you're technically

1334
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:04,360
able to do something doesn't mean it's economically viable.

1335
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:05,280
And I think

1336
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:06,350
encrypting

1337
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:08,199
encrypting all of your traffic

1338
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:14,179
was not a, a, you could do it say 10 or 15, even 20 years ago,

1339
00:53:14,189 --> 00:53:16,159
but it wasn't really economically viable.

1340
00:53:16,169 --> 00:53:17,520
Whereas today, like,

1341
00:53:17,689 --> 00:53:20,439
we're pretty close, man, we're really close.

1342
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:21,489
Honestly,

1343
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,520
we're at the point where it's just the

1344
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:25,110
whole certificate management thing is such a hairball.

1345
00:53:25,169 --> 00:53:25,989
Yeah. But

1346
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:27,040
there's,

1347
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:28,020
I'm

1348
00:53:28,429 --> 00:53:30,629
confident it's going to get fixed because I

1349
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:34,060
-- think there's huge market opportunity for that
-- now.

1350
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:36,620
Well, no, the point is we're past the hardware issue.

1351
00:53:37,169 --> 00:53:39,510
That's right. And you can't like the hardware issue is the hardware issue.

1352
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,139
Like, if your, if your system can only encrypt data at like 10 megabits per second,

1353
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:45,419
that's it. You're stuck with that.

1354
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:48,429
But, you know, as long, like now that we have AES and all the CP US,

1355
00:53:48,439 --> 00:53:51,310
we can encrypt as much data and decrypt it as much as we want.

1356
00:53:51,379 --> 00:53:54,020
You just have to handle all the keys and that, you know,

1357
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:57,469
there's management and pain in that and yeah, but we're getting better, you know,

1358
00:53:57,479 --> 00:53:59,010
-- it's,
-- it's getting there, it's getting there.

1359
00:53:59,919 --> 00:54:04,340
All right, man, I think we should call this one and we should assign some homework.

1360
00:54:05,219 --> 00:54:05,479
Yes.

1361
00:54:05,489 --> 00:54:08,919
So as any of you paying attention, no,

1362
00:54:08,929 --> 00:54:13,219
this is episode 41 of the open source security podcast.

1363
00:54:13,649 --> 00:54:18,439
-- The next episode is going to be number 42. And why is the number 42 special
-- Kurt?

1364
00:54:18,949 --> 00:54:21,310
Because it's the answer to life, the universe and everything.

1365
00:54:21,429 --> 00:54:22,199
-- That's right.
-- And,

1366
00:54:22,419 --> 00:54:23,429
and also all of our info.

1367
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:25,159
That's right.

1368
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,760
So initially we thought, oh, let,

1369
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:30,399
let's review the security of the Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy

1370
00:54:30,409 --> 00:54:32,580
book and then books are hard to read and they're big.

1371
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,459
So we thought that. That's a lot of work.

1372
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:38,419
So, yes, that's right. Reading's hard. Everybody, kids stay in school.

1373
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:42,979
So anyway, what we thought would be really fun to do is we're going to go through

1374
00:54:43,139 --> 00:54:46,560
the hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy movie from 2005

1375
00:54:46,709 --> 00:54:49,800
and kind of review the security themes and concepts from

1376
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:52,489
that and just have some fun in episode 42.

1377
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,100
And so

1378
00:54:53,669 --> 00:54:56,649
you won't have to watch it if you've never seen it before.

1379
00:54:56,659 --> 00:54:58,770
We will totally spoil it for you though. I'm not gonna lie,

1380
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:01,199
-- but it was
-- surprisingly not terrible.

1381
00:55:01,209 --> 00:55:03,020
I will say like, because, and I've seen, you know,

1382
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:05,209
the BBC series and I've seen the other stuff.

1383
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:09,219
I thought it was, it maintained the spirit and culture of it reasonably well.

1384
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:12,500
I don't know, I didn't think I thought it was ok, but

1385
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:13,870
I'll argue about that next week.

1386
00:55:13,979 --> 00:55:18,939
Uh So anyway, if you'd like, uh give it a watch, so you're, it's fresh in your mind.

1387
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:21,280
So as we go through all the silliness of it,

1388
00:55:21,439 --> 00:55:23,469
you know, exactly what we're talking about. So,

1389
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,010
yeah, I'm, I'm super excited. I can't wait. So.

1390
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:28,979
All right, let's, let's take it home folks. Thank you for listening.
