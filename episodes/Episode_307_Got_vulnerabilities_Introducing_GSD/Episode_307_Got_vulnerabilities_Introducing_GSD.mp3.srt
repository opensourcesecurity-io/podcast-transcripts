Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,319 --> 00:00:10,090
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:10,909
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:13,029
Now we're back to Thought Crime again.

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:18,170
-- Well, I mean, uh, we're not allowed to go outside anymore. So,
-- yeah,

5
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,139
kind of.

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,780
-- It's complicated anyway, actually,
-- it's not complicated.

7
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,340
There's actually two really simple solutions, but, well,

8
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,659
we all know what happened with those.

9
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:29,790
Anyways,

10
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:35,419
-- moving along on to happier topics.
-- Are there happier topics, uh,

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,330
puppies?

12
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:40,150
I, oh, man. So, ok. Ok. I'm gonna plug puppies for a minute because

13
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:44,139
I, I do have a dog who's big and stupid and, and awesome and, and we love him,

14
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,400
but there is a Twitter account called We rate Dogs.

15
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:52,349
And it is the best thing ever. I love, we rate dogs.

16
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:54,299
A, what about, I don't know, the Twitter account,

17
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,630
the raccoons that will cure your sadness.

18
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,759
-- I've never heard of this one. It
-- is, it's, it's, yeah, it is what it said it is.

19
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,419
And there's my favorite one so far is an older gentleman

20
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,209
sitting outside in the cold with a giant tub of hot dogs

21
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,620
and there's like 20 or 30 raccoons around him and they're

22
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:13,339
all enormously fat raccoons and he's just feeding them hot dogs.

23
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:14,400
I mean, that

24
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,169
-- sounds pretty awesome to me
-- except

25
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,489
-- for the rabies. But you know,
-- send me, send me,

26
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,290
send me that link. I'll put it in the show notes. I've never seen this before.

27
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:24,519
It's nice. This is what qualifies for a podcast now.

28
00:01:25,589 --> 00:01:26,730
Yeah, pretty much.

29
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:28,209
We gotta do something, man.

30
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:33,589
All right. So we want to talk about GSD today, the Global Security Database. Yeah.

31
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:36,819
Which also in hindsight was a terrible hashtag to choose because German

32
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,080
Shepherd dogs beat out us 100% of the time on Twitter.

33
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,650
-- I don't know.
-- OK. Look. All right.

34
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,519
I'm putting my foot down right now.

35
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:47,260
You keep making a big deal about something that is

36
00:01:47,269 --> 00:01:49,309
or isn't going to be a hashtag on social media.

37
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,650
And I think if you're planning anything about your project based upon Twitter,

38
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,470
hashtags

39
00:01:54,809 --> 00:01:58,330
the, you're setting yourself up for just abject failure.

40
00:01:58,839 --> 00:01:59,510
I would agree.

41
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,620
But also because Twitter is for old people,

42
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:05,309
I think all the new people are on what the tiktok and the Instagramming or

43
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,190
-- I
-- don't
-- mostly tiktok, I think.

44
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:13,779
No, I, I, no, no, I think from the concept of the, the infosec world, Twitter is

45
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:17,009
unfortunately the most important place you can be.

46
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,089
It shouldn't be, but it is, which I think Lord for J proved that.

47
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,250
Well, and this leads into the show, which is, well, what's the alternative?

48
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:26,289
We don't have one

49
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:29,089
and Well, that's where the global security database comes in.

50
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:31,320
-- The
-- alternative is thoughts and prayers today.

51
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:35,270
But we're gonna fix that. We're gonna make thoughts and prayers. Number three.

52
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:35,759
But I'm an

53
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:36,490
atheist

54
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,550
thoughts and prayers will be number three when we're done. That's the plan.

55
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,210
All right. So, anyway, all right.

56
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,509
-- Uh, send me that link because I'm still waiting for
-- it.

57
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:44,990
-- But
-- I

58
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:45,179
can't

59
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:45,649
find it.

60
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:46,460
-- What?
-- Oh,

61
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,479
my goodness.

62
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:48,050
Look,

63
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:53,460
your homework for the rest of the week is to find me that link.

64
00:02:53,809 --> 00:02:54,839
I need it.

65
00:02:55,779 --> 00:02:55,919
I'm

66
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:56,300
trying to

67
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:56,500
find

68
00:02:56,839 --> 00:02:59,470
my mental health. Depends on it at this point.

69
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:00,809
Anyway,

70
00:03:01,029 --> 00:03:02,949
Global Security Database.

71
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:06,589
I'm going to start telling the story while Kurt looks for this link

72
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:08,279
and then sends it to me

73
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,679
and we'll get, we'll, we'll get back to that later.

74
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:15,270
So, all right. So anyone who's been listening to the show for any period of time

75
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,190
knows that Kurt and I

76
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,250
were involved in this project long ago called Distributed Weakness and Filing.

77
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:24,100
We even did a whole episode on this when it was resurrected again.

78
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:27,589
I don't know, like a year or two ago, what happened is

79
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,710
Kirk created DWF long, long ago

80
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,669
DWF was

81
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,899
killed and it was meant to be,

82
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,750
-- uh,
-- killed. Is it, it just sort of died?

83
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,279
-- Yeah,
-- it's, it's complicated.

84
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:40,789
Well, the first one just sort of died.

85
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,990
The second one was killed.

86
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,779
The second one was not killed. The second one proved a point.

87
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:48,309
We'll get to that we'll get to that. All right. So first one happens, right.

88
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,300
Meant to be kind of community powered CV E for open source stops.

89
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,779
It's resurrected for a variety of reasons which we

90
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:56,929
actually have a whole podcast about we go into

91
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,199
and

92
00:03:58,429 --> 00:04:00,779
I'll, I'll put a link to the old DWF podcast.

93
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:04,059
It's, I don't know, a year to go a year, two years, whatever, it doesn't matter.

94
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:04,740
Right.

95
00:04:05,029 --> 00:04:05,740
So, basically,

96
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,860
what happens is the second reboot of DWF was

97
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:12,580
meant to be throwing down the gauntlet of attempting to

98
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,309
salvage what could be salvaged from CV E.

99
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:16,750
And we'll say

100
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:19,850
when the CV E board tried to get me fired from my job,

101
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:23,149
it became obvious that there was no way

102
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,390
to salvage what was there.

103
00:04:25,549 --> 00:04:30,579
And this is when we moved on. And it's actually a good thing I think because we have

104
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,350
an immense amount of freedom now.

105
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:36,429
Well, and one thing for the timeline is I, I actually had resigned from the board

106
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:39,750
prior to us kind of really pushing the DWF two point. Oh,

107
00:04:40,089 --> 00:04:41,260
-- yeah.
-- And that's, that's in the

108
00:04:41,269 --> 00:04:44,750
podcast, which in hindsight, I'm s I'm so glad I did

109
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:46,190
because

110
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:51,410
the right, otherwise you would have had to sign that, that mean letter,

111
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,260
that threatening letter signed

112
00:04:52,929 --> 00:04:53,179
by

113
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,459
my previous company. It was signed by the CV E board,

114
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,859
like talk to me on Twitter. I'll explain it anyway.

115
00:05:01,109 --> 00:05:01,940
So then

116
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:05,329
the Cloud Security Alliance basically says we're interested in

117
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:07,700
this project and we knew we needed a name.

118
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:09,049
So we picked something called UV, I,

119
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,859
which was universal vulnerability identifier.

120
00:05:12,549 --> 00:05:12,940
Ok.

121
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:13,519
That's,

122
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:13,790
that's

123
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:13,989
a,

124
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,140
I hated that name so much.

125
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:19,769
So he picked that knowing it was bad and it had to be changed.

126
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:22,119
There wasn't a lot of anything that happened for a while.

127
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:22,959
There's a lot of putting,

128
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:27,700
it's surprisingly difficult to stand up like these working groups and get all the,

129
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:30,420
the right pieces in place and get the right people involved.

130
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,079
Well, it's critical mass.

131
00:05:32,369 --> 00:05:35,750
Yeah, it's, I don't even think it's no critical mass comes next.

132
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,339
Like that's what we're working on now.

133
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,619
Just getting the right pieces in place, getting mailing list, set up, getting

134
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,959
the, the, what is it circle group, whatever that thing is CS A uses

135
00:05:47,059 --> 00:05:49,380
getting the right structure in place,

136
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,160
getting people from the CS A as part of the working group.

137
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,010
There's what the charter had to be written. There's, it's,

138
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,269
it's one of those things that like

139
00:05:57,609 --> 00:05:59,739
when I want to create a new open

140
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,440
source project, I just created github

141
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,459
Revo and I'm like, oh, here it is open

142
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,290
source project

143
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,250
and this is nothing like that. And

144
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,929
it,

145
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,510
I forget sometimes how much work some of this stuff is. So anyway,

146
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,910
we spent almost a year just putting up getting everything in place,

147
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,910
doing the right thing,

148
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:19,769
figuring a whole bunch of stuff out.

149
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,190
And now

150
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:26,869
it is what the, the 19th of, of January 2022 yesterday,

151
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:30,679
we had like the inaugural kickoff public meeting for the

152
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,119
global Security Database with the CS A and I,

153
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,059
I must say

154
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:39,140
I am tickled pink by the fact that 44 people were on that meeting for an hour.

155
00:06:39,309 --> 00:06:43,220
I, I literally expected like seven people plus

156
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:43,570
us.

157
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:43,959
Well,

158
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,179
and what was even better is some of them

159
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,730
actually cared and had good questions and concerns a

160
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,070
lot

161
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:48,329
of them

162
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,220
stuff.

163
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,140
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah,

164
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:54,920
I was II I, I'm tickled pink, 44 people that's

165
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,149
exceeded all of my expectations. I, I feel like

166
00:06:58,549 --> 00:07:01,829
we are in a place where everyone is starting

167
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:05,489
to recognize the importance of everything we need to do

168
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:06,600
and

169
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:09,670
we don't even have to explain the why, which is awesome.

170
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:14,309
-- So, but we will, I'll let you do that part because I just talked a lot. What is the
-- why?

171
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,989
It's really simple. We need a mapping of,

172
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,230
well, not just a mapping. We need a source of vulnerability data

173
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,470
for software and services and hardware and,

174
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,410
-- well, basically everything
-- just vulnerabilities

175
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:30,220
because for two reasons and this is the part for people,

176
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,820
forget they only usually think about the first reason which is, oh,

177
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:34,350
I need to know what I'm running and what's

178
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,869
what the vulnerabilities in the stuff I am running is

179
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,420
so that I can like go patch them and stuff

180
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:42,829
and that don't get me wrong. That that is important.

181
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,690
But the number two thing is so that developers can learn

182
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,929
and maybe

183
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,839
stop making the same mistakes or even better

184
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,679
build tools that don't make the mistake.

185
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,320
So a great example of this is, you know,

186
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:55,750
you had that presentation where you went through the

187
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:56,739
top 10

188
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:00,100
and you're like, it's actually three things and it was, what was it remind me?

189
00:08:00,109 --> 00:08:01,200
It was use a framework.

190
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,029
It was like use a framework, use authentication from

191
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:10,299
like someone else that's good. A K A use a framework and use

192
00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:10,989
crypto.

193
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,019
It was

194
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:15,760
no, I think that fell under. Don't roll your own off.

195
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:19,690
-- It was basically
-- the majority of it boiled down to pick a good framework and use

196
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,000
that.

197
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:23,029
-- Yeah, that's basically it, which
-- is like, that's exactly it.

198
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,880
Like the same thing with,

199
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:28,380
well, like the web servers. No, you pick one, don't write your own,

200
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:29,679
you know.

201
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,130
And so like,

202
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,549
because we're seeing this in the crypto world

203
00:08:32,558 --> 00:08:34,619
where people are making all these horrific mistakes.

204
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,359
And it's kind of like,

205
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:38,650
oh, you mean this thing that has been a documented, like

206
00:08:38,808 --> 00:08:40,679
software issue for 50 years?

207
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,130
Like, and what I love is even better yet,

208
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,380
like the Ethereum dow hack way back in the day.

209
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,869
There was like a specific article of concern about that re entr

210
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,599
the attack like two years in advance

211
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,469
and re entr

212
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:57,640
the attacks are, again, that's been something that's been known for decades,

213
00:08:57,739 --> 00:08:58,440
industry

214
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,799
like, you know, but because it's not well documented and it's not well understood.

215
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,289
People don't think about this, like,

216
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:07,520
how many developers still don't understand SQL injection

217
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:11,640
-- in, in a web world? And the answer is like, there, there's
-- a bunch.

218
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,440
Exactly.

219
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,479
Why should they,

220
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:16,109
you know, that's my argument. They shouldn't have to

221
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,869
-- care.
-- Actually, I would argue. Exactly. They, it's like

222
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,739
they should just be using frameworks that are so safe

223
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,299
that they don't even have to think about it.

224
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:25,270
-- I
-- mean, let me, here's a great example

225
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,619
at what temperature do your brake pads stop functioning in your car.

226
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,419
You don't know, you don't care. It doesn't matter.

227
00:09:33,969 --> 00:09:37,710
-- Well, it does if it hits minus 50 you slam on the brakes.
-- Well,

228
00:09:37,969 --> 00:09:41,599
I was just thinking heat, I didn't even consider the fact that the cold affects them,

229
00:09:41,609 --> 00:09:42,590
-- but
-- you're probably right.

230
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,460
My brakes were actually squealing a bit the other day because

231
00:09:44,469 --> 00:09:46,530
I washed my car and so the disc rotors got wet,

232
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:47,190
froze.

233
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,880
So there's like a thin, it turns out when there's a thin layer of ice on your rotors,

234
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,109
-- it's probably fine. I'm sure it's fine.
-- It cooked off.

235
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:54,650
It would be

236
00:09:54,869 --> 00:09:55,000
fine.

237
00:09:55,789 --> 00:09:57,679
Unlike that Tesla was shipped without a brake pad

238
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,679
anyways. But so,

239
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:02,119
so the problem is because we don't have this kind of inventory.

240
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,469
We don't like,

241
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:07,559
there are often times where I'm like, oh, this is a big problem and they're like, no,

242
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,000
it's not.

243
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,419
And I'm like, yes it is. I'm like, cool, show me the data I'm like, uh

244
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,070
it's

245
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,260
a big

246
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,580
problem. So we're, we're kind of pontificating in a silly direction.

247
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:18,500
But I think fundamentally what this all comes down to is

248
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:21,650
in the world of vulnerability identifiers.

249
00:10:21,809 --> 00:10:24,039
There's, the data is pretty bad.

250
00:10:24,049 --> 00:10:28,729
-- A lot of it is very pros, it's, it often has a lot of
-- errors. It's self

251
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,119
-- selected it.
-- Yeah, it's very self

252
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:31,919
selective.

253
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,650
Like an easy example is if I find a vulnerability in, let's say,

254
00:10:35,659 --> 00:10:37,450
Windows and Microsoft says we,

255
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,010
we claim that's not a vulnerability that's pretty much the end.

256
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:43,710
-- And that's not right.
-- Well, and it's 10 times worse with the bug bounty programs now.

257
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:44,750
Buying silence.

258
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,880
Oh yeah, totally. That's a different, that's a different problem.

259
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,549
And we, we won't worry about that at the moment.

260
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:53,849
But fundamentally what it comes down to is this data is hard to update.

261
00:10:53,859 --> 00:10:56,549
It's hard to acquire, it's hard to parse and

262
00:10:57,119 --> 00:11:00,280
it, it honestly, it shouldn't be this, this hard to fix it.

263
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:04,239
And so this is basically what the GSD is, is going to do.

264
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,140
Yeah, it's actually worse. It's not hard to update.

265
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,799
It's impossible to update because basically

266
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:09,659
there are private sources of data where

267
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,619
I don't think you can get those realistically updated.

268
00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:14,640
And then there's only one public.

269
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,330
So like there's only one real public source of data which is CV E,

270
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,340
there are obviously certs and other things, but

271
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,659
their data sets are so fragmented

272
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:26,659
and, and it's, it's pros like this isn't, this isn't well formed machine data.

273
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,900
This is just like crap Humans wrote,

274
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:31,460
which is literally the worst possible kind of data.

275
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,419
OK. So I'm done with the why?

276
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:38,580
What are we doing about it now? And this is the story of GSD.

277
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,059
What GSD is doing is, is kind of simple in a way. It's, it's 2022

278
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:46,539
and we have some well-established technologies and processes for having

279
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,130
large projects

280
00:11:48,789 --> 00:11:53,109
that have large data sets that get updated and that is get

281
00:11:53,239 --> 00:11:55,409
and well github because it's free to post,

282
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,010
you know.

283
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,570
Um And then

284
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:57,809
JSON

285
00:11:57,929 --> 00:11:58,330
data,

286
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,919
well, I would, I would even go

287
00:12:00,969 --> 00:12:03,690
well. And then the process is very simple in that

288
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,179
it's in git.

289
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:08,320
So like no matter how bad, we kind of make a mess of things,

290
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,820
we can always roll it back or fix it

291
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:10,619
well.

292
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,289
And, and look,

293
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:18,049
I think more importantly is what we want to do is create a community driven project

294
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:18,809
that

295
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,270
exists under the Cloud Security Alliance umbrella.

296
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,950
So this isn't like 11 government, there's not a company,

297
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,900
this is a, a very

298
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:28,619
public and open space.

299
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:33,640
And the intent is to use all of the process and knowledge and techniques

300
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:38,409
that open source has taught the world over the last what like 30 plus years

301
00:12:38,869 --> 00:12:40,890
and apply this to vulnerability data.

302
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,669
Because fundamentally at the moment,

303
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,229
all of the vulnerability data is walled garden

304
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:47,190
and that is not helping anyone.

305
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,929
It makes me sad that in the like security scanner space,

306
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,159
your ability to parse this data

307
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,400
and then make decisions of it is seen as a competitive advantage.

308
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,630
That's bananas, that should not be a competitive advantage. This is public data.

309
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,419
And that's actually a really good point that I often

310
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:08,690
don't think of because just consuming this data is a nightmare

311
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,919
like one quarter,

312
00:13:11,349 --> 00:13:15,440
like there's just all the data sets conflict and

313
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,729
the data within the data sets conflicts.

314
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:22,289
There's not a lot of standards around how the data is provided.

315
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:24,000
There's errors in the data, you know.

316
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:24,849
And

317
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:28,809
luckily we are seeing some changes like you know, with like uh in the ruby world,

318
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,140
we have like what is it yarn?

319
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:31,080
Auditor yard

320
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,299
bundle, whatever and it automatically kind of scans.

321
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:38,330
No Ruby is gem yarn is N PM.

322
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:41,539
Yeah, Ruby gems and it automatically scans and will tell you like, hey,

323
00:13:41,549 --> 00:13:43,200
you just build something with a bunch of security vols.

324
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:45,869
Do you want to do something about it or just forcibly ignore it? Cool.

325
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,409
But like now, you know, and knowing is half the battle, right?

326
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:49,520
Um

327
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:52,359
But you're right, like even just consuming the data is hard

328
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,619
and

329
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,200
yeah, traditionally,

330
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,599
there's been no way to update the data or

331
00:13:56,609 --> 00:14:00,359
append or amend or improve or correct the data.

332
00:14:00,369 --> 00:14:02,859
If, if you do spot up an obvious error,

333
00:14:02,989 --> 00:14:04,460
you know something as simple as like I,

334
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:07,099
I literally managed to the colors dot Js thing.

335
00:14:07,109 --> 00:14:07,919
I managed to

336
00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:09,280
spell it wrong.

337
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,849
I used color dot Js instead of with the S which, well, that's not the name.

338
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:16,609
Like if you plug that into N PM, you, that's not what it is.

339
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:17,799
And so

340
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:21,130
a module named color because N PM has like

341
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,849
every English word has been taken at this point.

342
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,820
-- Yeah.
-- Well, there's like 3 million NP MS.

343
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:29,049
So what is color? It's something else

344
00:14:29,219 --> 00:14:30,409
this actually

345
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,919
used to happen to me all the time when I would deal with vulnerability

346
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:39,609
reports where customers would run it against a product I was responsible for.

347
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:44,320
And for example, there would be a Java package and a node package with the same name.

348
00:14:44,789 --> 00:14:46,770
And so there'd be a vulnerability in one of them,

349
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,690
but the scanners couldn't tell the difference and so

350
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,489
they would just treat them as the same.

351
00:14:50,854 --> 00:14:51,315
Yeah.

352
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:55,525
I, it's funny when I saw that the OS V data format had the ecosystem and I'm like,

353
00:14:55,534 --> 00:14:56,775
oh yeah, that's, yeah.

354
00:14:56,815 --> 00:15:00,554
Well, yeah, like a wordpress package with the same name as an M PM package are two

355
00:15:00,715 --> 00:15:01,844
totally different things.

356
00:15:02,354 --> 00:15:02,794
-- Right.
-- Right.

357
00:15:02,804 --> 00:15:06,515
-- And, and we were running on
-- and the fact that we're still figuring that out is like,

358
00:15:06,525 --> 00:15:09,155
I'm just hitting my, you know, my head on the desk.

359
00:15:09,164 --> 00:15:11,755
It's like, good God, this should not be this hard to fix.

360
00:15:11,914 --> 00:15:14,265
Well. Ok. No, no, no. Look,

361
00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:20,520
the problem is, I think we have kicked this can down the road for more than a decade.

362
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:24,090
Because what we had while everyone can acknowledge

363
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:26,809
at this point is lacking in many ways,

364
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:31,520
it was good enough and no one wanted to do the work to fix it because let's face it.

365
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:35,640
This is some crap work and it's hard to do and it's not exciting.

366
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:39,039
This isn't the kind of stuff that's going to get you on the front page of a magazine.

367
00:15:39,489 --> 00:15:42,320
This is, but it's, it's foundational and important.

368
00:15:43,229 --> 00:15:44,849
Yep. Like collecting weather data.

369
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:46,210
Yeah. Right. Exactly.

370
00:15:46,219 --> 00:15:50,010
And, and look there, I know weather nerds that love this stuff and like,

371
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,130
God bless you all.

372
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,210
I'm not one of them.

373
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:52,419
Well,

374
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:53,969
what I mean is you actually have to collect all the data

375
00:15:53,979 --> 00:15:55,619
for a very long time for it to be of any use.

376
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,369
-- Right? But
-- there's people who love this.

377
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:01,890
I mean, I, I have a neighbor with a weather station on the roof of his garage and it,

378
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,729
like, don't ask

379
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,849
that man about weather, you know,

380
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,510
but, and, and God bless them.

381
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,270
Like, at the same time, I would say we are vulnerability nerds. We love this data.

382
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,770
We love processing it. I mean,

383
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,250
I have a project in my spare time where I parse public CV E data

384
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:18,849
and look for patterns and, and lessons in it.

385
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:20,330
Who does that?

386
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:23,119
You know, weirdos. That's who.

387
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,210
But that's ok.

388
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,309
Now we want to give the vulnerability nerds

389
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,669
a place to go and there was nowhere to go before this.

390
00:16:31,219 --> 00:16:34,650
No and well, and the few places there were to go had a really,

391
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:37,179
really sharp learning curve and steep on ramp.

392
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,340
Like there was no gentle way to get involved.

393
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:43,039
And that's something else the GST I want to fix is I wanna have like,

394
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:45,000
easy on ramps to get involved in this.

395
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:45,359
Like,

396
00:16:45,369 --> 00:16:49,559
if you literally just want to correct a one word typo or like a one character typo.

397
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,570
Yeah. Here we'll make it as easy.

398
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,919
Like you don't even have to fix it, just submit an issue.

399
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,159
-- Yeah,
-- exactly.

400
00:16:55,169 --> 00:16:58,580
-- This should be that easy.
-- And, and so this is, it's funny because

401
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,890
I remember back in the day

402
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,829
when I think it was Steve Ballmer made a comment about, oh, and open source.

403
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:07,250
Like anyone can just show up and contribute code

404
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:08,770
and like

405
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:12,848
he saw it as a negative, but everyone open source was like, yeah,

406
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,410
anyone can show up and contribute code.

407
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,939
And it was funny because you and I think the vulnerability world is very similar.

408
00:17:18,989 --> 00:17:21,479
It's like, oh, how will we know the date is correct?

409
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,030
It's like, how do we know the data

410
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:27,239
now is correct? We know it's full of mistakes. We know it's hard to understand.

411
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,660
We know it's hard to parse. Don't pretend like this data is magic.

412
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,760
The data we have today is crap.

413
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:36,650
And honestly, I'm skeptical we can do worse.

414
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:36,959
Well,

415
00:17:36,969 --> 00:17:39,680
one thing I'm wondering is virtually every security researcher

416
00:17:39,689 --> 00:17:41,449
I've talked to has at least one story of,

417
00:17:41,459 --> 00:17:43,650
I tried to push this vulnerability, you know,

418
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,630
nicely to this company and they denied it

419
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,199
and, you know what I give up

420
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:48,530
and I suspect,

421
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:51,310
I kind of wonder, does everybody have that story?

422
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:54,550
I suspect the answer is yes. It's absolutely yes.

423
00:17:54,569 --> 00:17:57,359
You know, and it's kind of like that left handed bagpipe repairman thing.

424
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:59,030
It turns out the village is full of them.

425
00:17:59,469 --> 00:18:01,890
You know, we just never had a message board to talk about on.

426
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,050
I don't, I don't know what that means.

427
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,489
So, like you think you're rare,

428
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,130
you think you're the only one that's had this experience

429
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,670
with this vendor and it turns out that no,

430
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,599
-- that's, this is
-- no.

431
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,329
Wait, how does it have to do with left handed bagpipes though?

432
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:12,949
I don't, I don't understand that reference.

433
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:13,209
Well,

434
00:18:13,219 --> 00:18:15,550
like there's right-handed bag pipes and left-handed bag pipes

435
00:18:15,589 --> 00:18:17,650
are there left handed bag pipes are more rare,

436
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:18,329
are they?

437
00:18:18,579 --> 00:18:19,260
I don't know,

438
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,420
I don't know. It's a, it's at this hour is 22 minutes reference.

439
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,989
I don't know what that is either. It's a Canadian comedy show.

440
00:18:26,329 --> 00:18:27,099
It's really good.

441
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,469
But yeah, so that's the thing.

442
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,739
It's like, like this log for J thing, you know, initially,

443
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,859
like it was kind of played up as being really terrible.

444
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,530
Uh turns out it was actually kind of worse,

445
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:42,180
you know, but it was, it was on Twitter of all things. And thank goodness that hashtag

446
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,780
-- like that hashtag did the coordinate and heavy lifting,
-- which is bananas.

447
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,650
I mean, you figure between the hashtag and

448
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:49,609
gassy, the dog

449
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,739
that was basically the log for J coordinate.

450
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,089
I mean, just what

451
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,329
I still don't even know.

452
00:18:57,579 --> 00:19:00,410
I just keep thinking how much worse it could have been.

453
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,459
You know, it's, it's, well,

454
00:19:01,469 --> 00:19:03,459
it's kind of like log for Jay is like one of those events

455
00:19:03,469 --> 00:19:06,449
like freezing rain where it kind of just affects everybody a little bit.

456
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,979
It's just sort of a universal thing, you know, it's not like a car crash.

457
00:19:09,989 --> 00:19:13,239
It's just like everybody has slippery slide walks now, go deal with it. Good luck.

458
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,069
It affected a lot of people a

459
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:17,349
-- lot.
-- Well, but you know what I'm saying? Right.

460
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:19,750
Like, it wasn't some singular incident. It was,

461
00:19:20,349 --> 00:19:22,599
it was like, it was like a hurricane versus a tornado.

462
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:26,189
Yeah. Yeah. Right. Because tornadoes have a narrow path of destruction.

463
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:28,329
Whereas hurricanes are enormous.

464
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,119
It's like the state of Florida.

465
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,530
Right. Right. That is fair. I agree with that.

466
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:33,969
And,

467
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:36,380
and this is also the more normal thing because,

468
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,420
well,

469
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,650
it turns out

470
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:41,290
we deployed these web apps that, uh, well, it

471
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,209
pulls in some stuff. Who cares?

472
00:19:43,329 --> 00:19:46,500
Well, the problem is that some stuff is now like 1000 dependencies deep.

473
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,479
Yeah, that's one of the things that, so I, I have another side project.

474
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:52,834
I'm gonna, I'm going to give some talks on this at some point, but I took the top, like,

475
00:19:52,844 --> 00:19:55,104
130 containers in Docker hub.

476
00:19:55,685 --> 00:19:59,564
And I, I yanked out all of the dependencies. I basically ran.

477
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,974
There's these two scanners called sift and Gripe that

478
00:20:01,984 --> 00:20:04,484
anchor creates sift is an S bomb generator.

479
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,145
Gripe is a vulnerability scanner.

480
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:10,170
I pulled down the containers. I scanned them with sifting gripe.

481
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:13,270
I put the data into elastic search and then I started looking at it.

482
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:16,930
Guess how many dependencies the, the worst?

483
00:20:16,939 --> 00:20:19,189
I, I guess, I don't know if I'd call it the largest container.

484
00:20:19,199 --> 00:20:23,390
-- I don't w worst
-- defender. I'm gonna go with order of magnitude higher. 10,000,

485
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,640
-- 3000, you're pretty close. So
-- within 1000 and 10,000,

486
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:29,079
like

487
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:29,699
that's,

488
00:20:30,089 --> 00:20:34,520
-- that's three zeros,
-- that's a lot of packages in one container.

489
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,660
-- Do I
-- dare ask which language? All of

490
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,199
them?

491
00:20:38,969 --> 00:20:39,069
I,

492
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,579
I don't remember the name of it off the top of my

493
00:20:41,589 --> 00:20:43,459
head and I'm not going to look it up right now,

494
00:20:43,469 --> 00:20:47,410
but I mean, most of them are in the neighborhood of 200 ish give or take.

495
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:48,510
But you,

496
00:20:48,729 --> 00:20:49,160
I mean,

497
00:20:49,469 --> 00:20:51,160
that's a lot of stuff though.

498
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:54,219
-- I
-- mean, it depends on how often it gets updated and how we see this update.

499
00:20:54,229 --> 00:20:55,130
Like, and again,

500
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,229
that's part of the problem is some of

501
00:20:56,239 --> 00:20:58,760
the stuff updates pretty easy without breaking stuff.

502
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,459
Well, it also depends on what you're using.

503
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:03,800
Like, for example, the alpine container has almost nothing in it.

504
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:08,375
Whereas a Debbie and a redhead container is kind of big and there's a lot of stuff. So

505
00:21:08,576 --> 00:21:12,706
it, it's this weird dance we're doing right now with all this container,

506
00:21:12,715 --> 00:21:13,296
everything.

507
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:14,926
But anyway, it doesn't matter. OK.

508
00:21:14,936 --> 00:21:18,135
So in the time we have left, I want to talk about kind of

509
00:21:18,286 --> 00:21:19,036
how,

510
00:21:19,046 --> 00:21:23,076
how a listener who's interested can get involved in working

511
00:21:23,086 --> 00:21:26,956
with GSD because I think part like we want help

512
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:31,235
anyone, even if all you have are ideas or you,

513
00:21:31,322 --> 00:21:33,751
you want to ask some questions or like literally

514
00:21:33,982 --> 00:21:38,411
anything you can contribute is a positive. So how are we doing this?

515
00:21:38,421 --> 00:21:40,092
And all these links will go on the show note.

516
00:21:40,102 --> 00:21:41,661
So don't worry about trying to write anything down.

517
00:21:41,812 --> 00:21:45,102
So if you really want to get involved, you know, join the mailing list,

518
00:21:45,112 --> 00:21:46,802
join the circle group, you know,

519
00:21:46,812 --> 00:21:50,621
follow or what is it star us or follow fork or whatever on

520
00:21:50,921 --> 00:21:51,232
github

521
00:21:51,462 --> 00:21:54,771
if you, if you want to be involved, but like not get involved involved,

522
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:56,541
like just throw issues at us in

523
00:21:56,741 --> 00:21:57,092
github.

524
00:21:57,959 --> 00:22:00,339
You know, like if, if you spot a flaw in the data,

525
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,250
just file an issue against that file

526
00:22:02,869 --> 00:22:04,239
and run away, that's fine.

527
00:22:05,209 --> 00:22:07,099
You know, like literally just say like there's,

528
00:22:07,109 --> 00:22:09,219
there's a typo there or that thing is wrong or

529
00:22:09,349 --> 00:22:09,770
you know, Zabi

530
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:10,640
is spelled Zabi,

531
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:11,180
not

532
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:11,869
Zabi,

533
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,339
literally, you know, it just something as small as that, you know,

534
00:22:16,349 --> 00:22:18,099
but these errors do matter because that,

535
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:20,290
that CP data no longer works because there is no Zabi

536
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,829
that's right. That's right.

537
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,050
And so now I, I wanna part of this, I wanna kind of explain what we're doing.

538
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,819
So, what Kurt's talking about is

539
00:22:29,109 --> 00:22:32,699
there was a AC pe added by the NVD project.

540
00:22:32,709 --> 00:22:37,829
NVD adds C pe data to all of the CD ES which is complicated and weird,

541
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:39,589
but basically they, they misspelled something

542
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,780
now getting them to update it is difficult.

543
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:44,329
Not that I'm saying we shouldn't try and we want to get it done.

544
00:22:44,339 --> 00:22:46,729
-- But
-- how do you actually get the NVD to update stuff? You have to

545
00:22:46,739 --> 00:22:47,359
email them

546
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:48,949
and hope,

547
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:50,219
thoughts and prayers.

548
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:54,170
And so basically what we've done is we've taken,

549
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,939
we have a mirror of all this data in GSDGSD is

550
00:22:56,949 --> 00:23:00,660
specifically designed to be able to be compatible with CV E.

551
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:04,489
So you can just literally change CV E to GSD in an ID

552
00:23:04,979 --> 00:23:06,050
and you can find it.

553
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:12,290
And so now we can add a note basically to the, the, the data

554
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:15,030
from NVD that says

555
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:19,530
actually this is the right C pe name, not what's in the NVD data.

556
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:22,089
And that takes seconds to do which is great

557
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,770
and more to the point, it's transparent and open.

558
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:28,290
Like if you file an issue with us, you, you can know that we're ignoring you versus

559
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:30,609
like knowing if your email got there or not.

560
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,829
Right. Right. And, and who is working on it? Who did the update?

561
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:36,130
Where did it come from?

562
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:37,920
There is a lot going on

563
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:39,500
did somebody else already file this

564
00:23:39,989 --> 00:23:40,329
too.

565
00:23:40,849 --> 00:23:42,270
That's something that always drove me nuts is all

566
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,680
these places where I want to report an issue.

567
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:45,430
But it's like somebody must have reported this.

568
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,219
Right.

569
00:23:47,449 --> 00:23:51,069
Well, maybe, I don't know. You know, should I, should I bother? Will they fix it?

570
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,459
I don't know. You know,

571
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,650
and then by the time I sort of try to figure out how to contact them, it's like,

572
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,380
you know what, I, I could go have a sandwich

573
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,900
and sandwiches usually when

574
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,380
I will agree with that.

575
00:24:01,589 --> 00:24:02,369
But no, seriously, right.

576
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:07,229
This should be this like think about how much work it is to file a bug in open source.

577
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:07,760
And

578
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:11,069
it should be about actually less work than that because we don't need to

579
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:13,699
know what run time you are or what version of the software you're running.

580
00:24:13,849 --> 00:24:14,630
It's just like

581
00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:17,250
you spotted a problem, let us know

582
00:24:17,729 --> 00:24:18,430
bing done,

583
00:24:18,689 --> 00:24:19,079
right?

584
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,910
Or even better

585
00:24:21,069 --> 00:24:25,989
-- submit a pull request with the change you want to see,
-- be the change you want to see,

586
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,310
right?

587
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:27,630
And now I, I will say

588
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:31,479
how we're going about doing a lot of this is still in flux because

589
00:24:31,489 --> 00:24:35,349
we want to have community discussions around what the data format should look like,

590
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:38,849
how we want to structure the data, how we provide updates to things.

591
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:41,189
And so there's kind of a lot going on

592
00:24:41,609 --> 00:24:45,199
and I mean, this is again where we, we want people to help us answer these questions,

593
00:24:45,209 --> 00:24:49,000
you know, come and participate in the discussion and, and ask questions and,

594
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,689
and give your opinions because

595
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:53,079
there's no right or wrong way for any of this stuff.

596
00:24:53,089 --> 00:24:55,260
I mean, this is, this is how open source works.

597
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:59,609
Open source works because of participation. Not because you have,

598
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:00,180
you know,

599
00:25:00,189 --> 00:25:02,050
two hour meetings every week and then no

600
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,640
one makes decisions and everyone just complains about.

601
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:08,359
No, no, like just do the work meetings are not where work happens.

602
00:25:08,489 --> 00:25:11,349
And that's the beauty too is you can very easily just fork the repo

603
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:15,219
and do your own experimentation. And then, you know, come back to us with

604
00:25:15,449 --> 00:25:19,869
like, show us because like, I, I've invented, you know, a vulnerability

605
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:21,260
json format

606
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:23,709
and it's terrible because I invented it and

607
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:27,579
wasn't able to get much input from anybody. So I did what I needed and well,

608
00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:30,619
it turns out what I needed was wrong for myself, let alone other people,

609
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,680
you know, that start though.

610
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:35,560
Exactly. And so that's the beauty is, you know, it's,

611
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,780
we also see,

612
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:38,849
and this is the other trick is there

613
00:25:38,859 --> 00:25:41,459
have been open source vulnerability databases in the past

614
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,400
and they all fall into the monetization trap of,

615
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:48,510
-- well, trying to monetize
-- here's the difference.

616
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,599
And I want to uh we probably should have talked about this in the very beginning.

617
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,050
But fundamentally,

618
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:57,050
this is why the Cloud Security Alliance is involved because if a,

619
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,469
if a company is behind this data

620
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:03,250
what you end up with is like, you can be altruistic at the beginning,

621
00:26:03,489 --> 00:26:04,729
but generally speaking,

622
00:26:04,739 --> 00:26:07,030
you're gonna see a lack of involvement because let's face it.

623
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,390
If I'm a competitor or I'm,

624
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,050
you know, involved in some other way,

625
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,560
I'm gonna be hesitant to be working with you a

626
00:26:13,569 --> 00:26:16,209
lot because you're gonna benefit from my hard work.

627
00:26:16,239 --> 00:26:16,880
Right?

628
00:26:17,189 --> 00:26:19,699
And so when you have something like the Cloud Security Alliance,

629
00:26:19,709 --> 00:26:20,810
the Cloud Security Alliance

630
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:24,390
knows there's never going to be money made off this. They know that

631
00:26:24,939 --> 00:26:26,969
the intent isn't to make money.

632
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:29,750
And I think that's the difference between foundations

633
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,890
and companies and to date every single vulnerability

634
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:37,170
data set that has existed that I'm aware of has been part of a company.

635
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,770
And I think that is why they have all failed

636
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,709
and let's face it. The only reason CV E works

637
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:45,260
is because the Federal Government of the United

638
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,650
States is literally throwing money onto the fire

639
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,530
like that's it.

640
00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:52,369
Yeah. No, it's interesting to see and it's,

641
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:56,729
I also want to build this so that intentionally it's not that oh,

642
00:26:56,739 --> 00:26:58,709
companies can use this if they want.

643
00:26:58,719 --> 00:27:00,949
No, no, I want companies to strip mine this

644
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:05,010
and I want companies to use this and also maybe never give back because,

645
00:27:05,219 --> 00:27:06,880
well, it's gonna happen whether I like it or not

646
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,010
-- and if we're even remotely successful
-- and, and look, here's the thing, this is,

647
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:16,209
this is just like open source, let's say 5% of the users give back and that's it.

648
00:27:16,689 --> 00:27:17,670
But that's ok.

649
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,109
That's also where you can run into some scale where if you,

650
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:24,609
if you have four users and one gives back, yeah, that kind of sucks.

651
00:27:24,619 --> 00:27:27,199
But if you have 10 million users

652
00:27:27,469 --> 00:27:29,599
and 5% give back, like

653
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,670
that's a pretty big number of people, you know,

654
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:35,609
and I think that's the key and that's the thing, you need to understand that a lot of,

655
00:27:36,209 --> 00:27:39,290
a lot of the vulnerability databases to date have not.

656
00:27:39,589 --> 00:27:42,270
-- And they haven't made it easy to give back.
-- Well, that too. Exactly.

657
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:44,930
I double dog dare anybody to go and try and

658
00:27:44,939 --> 00:27:47,910
update a vulnerability in any other vulnerability data set.

659
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:50,709
Uh That's not true. Some of the, like Ruby and,

660
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:52,290
and Python data sets

661
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:54,089
are very public and usable.

662
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,390
Ok. Well, I, I don't. Yeah. Ok. Yeah.

663
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:56,550
II,

664
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,640
I was talking more about the sort of general data

665
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:01,469
-- sets like the commercial vendors
-- or here's the thing to remember

666
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:04,079
is the only reason like Ruby and Python are doing their

667
00:28:04,089 --> 00:28:07,229
own thing is because they gave up on everything else.

668
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,589
-- Well, there's no other option.
-- No, there isn't.

669
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:12,739
And so they were just like, screw it. I'll do it myself.

670
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:15,670
And that sucks too because now how much infrastructure

671
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,650
are they trying to take care of and maintain

672
00:28:17,849 --> 00:28:20,020
-- to support this endeavor?
-- Right.

673
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:23,569
Well, and the duplication of effort too, that's what really drives me nuts. Is

674
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:27,859
all these companies with all these data sets that all sort of overlap and not really.

675
00:28:27,869 --> 00:28:30,800
But man, I'd really rather just have one good data set.

676
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:31,910
I agree.

677
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,010
Yeah. So come join us. It's easy.

678
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,250
It's going to be easy. There's a lot of work to do.

679
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:42,119
I'm not going to pretend we have all the answers or all the hard work has been done.

680
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,180
There is an enormous amount of work and

681
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,510
obviously,

682
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,250
one of the advantages of getting in early is

683
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,969
you can have a dramatic effect on whatever's happening.

684
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,530
One of the disadvantages is

685
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,300
you have to do a lot of the work.

686
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:55,479
It's still

687
00:28:55,589 --> 00:28:55,609
uh

688
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:59,729
-- it's, yeah, we're still in the pioneer phase.
-- So I, I mean, I don't know, I guess

689
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,040
this is,

690
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:04,699
we just spent what, half an hour advertising for our project,

691
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:07,020
which I guess is part of the fun of having a podcast.

692
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,670
But yeah, I mean, I mean, in all seriousness,

693
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,250
like we're completely serious if you're listening, tell your friends this is,

694
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:15,040
you know, we've, we've never, we don't ask much of the people who listen,

695
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:18,729
we don't ask for your likes or your subscribes, we're just happy to have you.

696
00:29:18,739 --> 00:29:21,250
But like in all seriousness in this particular instance,

697
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:25,089
if you know anyone who you think could be, could benefit from

698
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:29,140
the global Security database or anything going on in this space, like by all means,

699
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:32,609
please, please, please point them in the direction of GSD

700
00:29:32,869 --> 00:29:36,729
because I think this is one of those projects that we desperately need

701
00:29:36,949 --> 00:29:38,410
and it cannot fail.

702
00:29:38,699 --> 00:29:39,430
Well, I,

703
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:40,640
yeah,

704
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:43,469
yeah, because I mean, we, we've tried everything else and it's been, well,

705
00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:44,209
-- here we
-- are.

706
00:29:44,239 --> 00:29:46,569
I don't know if anyone's tried anything else. It's,

707
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:47,469
I

708
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:47,810
think

709
00:29:48,689 --> 00:29:50,000
i, it's complicated.

710
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:53,910
But anyway, so anyway, there we have it. I'm gonna call this one.

again,

715
