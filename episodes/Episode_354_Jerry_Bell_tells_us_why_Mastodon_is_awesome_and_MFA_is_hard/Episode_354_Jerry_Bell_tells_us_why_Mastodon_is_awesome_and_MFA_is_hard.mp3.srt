Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself Kurtz Siefried

1
00:00:08,989 --> 00:00:11,779
and my partner in fleeing Twitter from Mastodon, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:11,899 --> 00:00:16,610
Holy cow. Do we have a fun conversation today? So there's a thread

3
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:22,010
on infosec dot exchange that's all about kind of the M fa and, and

4
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:25,649
account setups and stuff. And it's just fascinating

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,569
that on the security instance,

6
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,750
-- there's only like 16% of people using
-- M fa, I mean, in fairness, my account,

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,580
I didn't even bother to enable M FA

8
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,439
because I have a strong password manager generated password

9
00:00:36,779 --> 00:00:39,799
and I don't use that account like I have it like I was going to use it,

10
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,400
but then I ended up at Master Dawn dot social.

11
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:43,110
So I did the transfer thing of a jigger.

12
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:45,659
And so it's like, yeah, is that really a problem? I don't think so.

13
00:00:45,669 --> 00:00:47,750
But yeah, it was kind of shocking. I think it was 16

14
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:49,139
percent or something

15
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:55,880
-- use M fa
-- which 16%. And I'm disappointed that you didn't, uh you know, invite me here.

16
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,490
I had to find out about this,

17
00:00:58,029 --> 00:00:59,369
your direct messages

18
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:02,389
J Bell. Welcome to the show.

19
00:01:03,459 --> 00:01:03,779
All right,

20
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,260
for anyone who doesn't know we've got Jerry here and he runs

21
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:10,019
Infosec dot Exchange and we are ecstatic to have you here,

22
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:10,319
Jerry.

23
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,019
-- Thank you. Absolutely
-- happy to be here. Thank you for having me.

24
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,720
-- So
-- why don't you set this one up for us?

25
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,709
Because you're actually the horse's mouth in this instance,

26
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,040
instead of us just repeating whatever we've read on various threads on Mastodon.

27
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:23,410
So

28
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:23,680
um

29
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:26,769
specific to two fa you know, there's been,

30
00:01:26,779 --> 00:01:30,410
I think a lot of consternation slash disappointment

31
00:01:30,419 --> 00:01:33,239
at the level of adoption of two fa

32
00:01:33,389 --> 00:01:38,169
on, on our, on our uh infosec that exchange masted on instance, it's, um you know,

33
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,360
it started off at about 16% or so.

34
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:44,650
But the, you know, the reality is like we went, the instance is, you know,

35
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,690
five years old.

36
00:01:45,699 --> 00:01:48,459
And so there's, there's quite a few old events in the

37
00:01:48,839 --> 00:01:49,419
notes. And so if you

38
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:50,209
count that

39
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,559
and you only look at the people who have recently registered,

40
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:56,599
it's closer to the 25 to 30% range.

41
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,800
And even after, by the way, like badgering people to do it. And I know that there were

42
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,150
people who, who did go turn it on, it didn't really move the needle much.

43
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:10,210
I'm shocked like, OK, so here is, I think the, the,

44
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,360
the fundamental discussion that I was interested in having on this is

45
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,100
if you listen to security people,

46
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,970
we're all telling everyone to turn on multi factor authentication constantly,

47
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:23,250
right?

48
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:27,190
Like I, I feel like it's an underlying message in every discussion.

49
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:30,250
-- I
-- think
-- it's replaced that you have to install antivirus message from, like,

50
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:31,169
20 years ago.

51
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:33,589
Yeah, I'll take that.

52
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,779
But, like, so there's this underlying theme of, oh, you have to do this,

53
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:39,539
but we're not doing it.

54
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,740
I mean, even 30% feels

55
00:02:41,869 --> 00:02:45,020
-- painfully low to me.
-- Absolutely.

56
00:02:45,029 --> 00:02:49,330
Now, there's, you know, is, it is, it's come out, there's quite a few reasons.

57
00:02:49,339 --> 00:02:50,580
There's some people who,

58
00:02:50,589 --> 00:02:55,139
who don't think it's important to do in the context of a Mastodon account.

59
00:02:55,149 --> 00:02:55,830
There's

60
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,110
people who didn't know that the setting even existed.

61
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:02,000
There are lots of people who registered through a

62
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:04,839
mobile app and the mobile app doesn't expose that.

63
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:06,330
There's um,

64
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,850
-- I,
-- I find the mobile apps are problematic in so many ways.

65
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,490
Like my feed is six items in my mobile app and

66
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,720
then I log in on the website and it's like bl,

67
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:14,830
you know,

68
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:15,320
yeah,

69
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,199
I don't know what the deal there is.

70
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,910
I know that there's a lot of people and II, I have a feeling it's,

71
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:24,360
you know, that Twitter kind of trained, trained us a certain

72
00:03:24,529 --> 00:03:25,970
behavior. I've been

73
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:30,470
on, obviously been using Mastodon for, for quite some time

74
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:32,289
and I've tried

75
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:35,250
over the years, I've tried lots and lots of different

76
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:39,070
mobile apps and to be honest, I keep just coming back to the webinar

77
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,539
because it's so much

78
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,240
more reliable. It, uh more feature rich, I guess.

79
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:46,580
Well, and like, I noticed in some mobile apps,

80
00:03:46,589 --> 00:03:48,875
they use different words for like they call it D MS

81
00:03:48,884 --> 00:03:50,955
or they call it like they just use different verbiage.

82
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:51,865
And I was looking, I'm like,

83
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:53,095
is this, this is a master

84
00:03:53,285 --> 00:03:54,994
app, right? Like, like this is not a

85
00:03:55,244 --> 00:03:56,065
I it was,

86
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:59,404
yeah, I, I feel bad for normal people trying to use these things.

87
00:03:59,414 --> 00:04:03,684
Anybody can go and create a, create an app and post it to the,

88
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:08,585
you know, to, to the app store, the Google Play Store. Like there's not a,

89
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,380
like there's no,

90
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:12,169
you know, authoritative

91
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,720
source for, for Mastodon or fevers

92
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:16,209
apps. So

93
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,250
that doesn't actually surprise me that much.

94
00:04:20,308 --> 00:04:21,248
Who knew?

95
00:04:21,308 --> 00:04:25,889
Ok, so here is one of my questions, I guess then for, for the two of you to,

96
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:28,049
to think about, I feel like

97
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:31,739
I'm not totally surprised that security people haven't enabled a lot

98
00:04:31,748 --> 00:04:34,128
of two factor uh for many of the reasons we've described.

99
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,799
But I think the root of the problem is

100
00:04:36,808 --> 00:04:40,498
that multi factor authentication is hard to use.

101
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:42,859
I think it's still too hard to use for normal people.

102
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:43,569
And

103
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:46,329
that feels like the crux of the issue to me.

104
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:47,470
I want to add to that.

105
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,200
I think it's worse than that because using two fa within a company where you

106
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:52,549
have like a concierge level of service to

107
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:54,170
recover your account if something goes wrong.

108
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,799
And even there we get pushed back on people using two fa

109
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:01,079
and like for myself using two fa, like, I have a bunch of tokens.

110
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:03,670
I still have to ferry one to the bank safe deposit box.

111
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,579
So, if my house burns down it's, you know, I have it.

112
00:05:06,109 --> 00:05:10,350
Yeah, normal people aren't willing to do this, like, for their own account.

113
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:12,890
I just, I only do it because, you know, I preach it.

114
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:14,380
So I'm supposed to be doing it, I guess.

115
00:05:14,989 --> 00:05:15,450
And,

116
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:16,160
yeah, I,

117
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,279
I can't help but think that it's just if

118
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,940
you use a good password and a password manager,

119
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,350
that's like 99% of your protection right there.

120
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:23,040
Right. I,

121
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,269
I'm making up that number but it seems about right.

122
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:28,519
It really depends on what you're,

123
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:31,350
what you're trying to guard against. But in general,

124
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,760
yes.

125
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,480
Uh, I, I will tell you a big problem.

126
00:05:35,489 --> 00:05:39,209
People have, say internet properties in general have, is

127
00:05:39,309 --> 00:05:41,160
people using the same password

128
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:42,510
across sites.

129
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:44,660
They have to like, if they don't use a password manager,

130
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,549
what else are they going to do?

131
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,500
I will say, by the way, you know, you, you brought up an interesting point there,

132
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,420
there are

133
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,049
5000

134
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,429
people who have M fa enabled on, on our instance.

135
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,190
So it's, you know, a fair amount bar, none.

136
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,579
The most common request for help I get is

137
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,149
I locked myself out

138
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,829
a new phone, my phone broke,

139
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,070
you know, I have seen so many

140
00:06:09,179 --> 00:06:12,089
different stories of what happened to people's phones

141
00:06:12,549 --> 00:06:14,190
and, uh, it's, it's pretty funny

142
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:20,670
And um you know, so, so I would probably estimate I've, I've had to unlock

143
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:21,890
maybe 100

144
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:23,309
notes in the past month.

145
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,890
Now, how does that compare?

146
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:26,130
So,

147
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,279
obviously Mastodon has had an enormous influx of users

148
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,809
in the last like two months or so,

149
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,779
have most of those come recently or have they been spread out

150
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,209
-- evenly over the last five years or
-- in the first five years?

151
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,890
Maybe it happened twice?

152
00:06:41,309 --> 00:06:45,200
Holy cow since it's all happened since October 27th.

153
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,670
Oh, my goodness. I mean, so this doesn't totally surprise me, I guess, but it also,

154
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,239
I think raises one of the enormous challenges.

155
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:00,929
So I don't want to, I want you to explain this in a way that doesn't make a mess for you.

156
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,269
But

157
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,489
when you,

158
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:06,709
how much verification are you doing? If someone says, oh, I lost my phone, like

159
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,000
what that,

160
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,260
because obviously you're kind of the guy who does

161
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:12,339
all the work here to verify and reset things.

162
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,179
So, so typically I, I

163
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,890
rely on their ability to,

164
00:07:17,109 --> 00:07:19,029
um, to have access to their email account.

165
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,489
-- That makes sense. That's fair.
-- There's, there's, there's been a couple of

166
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:26,649
exceptional cases outside of that, like where,

167
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,640
um in particular somebody's registered an account on behalf, you know,

168
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:31,739
in somebody else's name.

169
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,730
And so we've, we've, I've had to go through some

170
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:34,170
inu

171
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,010
verification of who they are. But beyond that, it's,

172
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,609
you know, I've, I've relied on people's ability to access their email.

173
00:07:41,619 --> 00:07:42,519
Well, that's, I mean,

174
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:45,350
that's every recovery system I've ever seen comes back to either their

175
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:48,190
email address or their phone number because what else can we do?

176
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,440
Like, there's no other way to push a message to them

177
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:51,170
and,

178
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,019
and there's nothing else that's unique,

179
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:53,459
right?

180
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,980
Their option would be just to tell, tell them, look,

181
00:07:55,989 --> 00:07:57,730
you're out of luck and you got to go create

182
00:07:57,739 --> 00:08:00,609
-- a new account which does
-- happen from time to time.

183
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,850
And this is so let's explain this because I don't think everyone understands what,

184
00:08:06,859 --> 00:08:08,010
what we just talked about.

185
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,609
So when you

186
00:08:09,809 --> 00:08:14,130
have an account on any service and you set up multi factor authentication,

187
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,619
you obviously have a user name, you have a password, which should be in a password

188
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,880
manager and then you have your multi factor, you could have a aub key,

189
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,899
you could have an authenticator app on your phone, whatever.

190
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,299
Right. There's that, that thing you have and

191
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:29,670
if you lose your phone or you lose your UI

192
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:30,980
key or whatever,

193
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,989
you have no way to get into your account

194
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:35,729
without contacting

195
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,250
somebody who can basically reset the multi factor authentication in the case of,

196
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,700
of or disable it.

197
00:08:41,739 --> 00:08:44,570
Right. Right. Well, exactly, in the case of Infosec dot Exchange,

198
00:08:44,979 --> 00:08:47,159
they have to contact Jerry and say Jerry,

199
00:08:47,169 --> 00:08:51,940
please take pity on me and do this and this sounds simple, but it's not

200
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:56,280
because I mean, so let me ask how many people are in infosec that exchange now,

201
00:08:56,289 --> 00:08:57,400
36,000.

202
00:08:57,609 --> 00:08:59,640
Ok. And you've got 100 requests,

203
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,309
you grew to

204
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,489
360,000.

205
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:03,859
Well,

206
00:09:03,869 --> 00:09:06,750
apart from probably not having anything else to

207
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,010
do in your life except manage the instance.

208
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,289
But now you'd be talking 1000 requests, right?

209
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:14,739
Like this, this generally scales linearly,

210
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,359
right?

211
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,919
That is not

212
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,530
a tenable situation.

213
00:09:18,549 --> 00:09:21,849
-- Well, unless you automate it, we would
-- either have to automate it.

214
00:09:22,099 --> 00:09:23,640
You know, there, there is a um

215
00:09:24,049 --> 00:09:26,090
you know, that there is an api that I,

216
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:28,390
I could envision some way to automate it,

217
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:30,919
but that's, that's not super ideal.

218
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,630
Most likely I would have to enlist,

219
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,880
-- you know, volunteers to help and then
-- vet them

220
00:09:36,929 --> 00:09:37,530
because,

221
00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:38,789
well, we've learned from

222
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:39,039
in,

223
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,080
you know.

224
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:40,919
Right.

225
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,409
I know, I know. Right.

226
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:44,630
It's like, I'm, I'm definitely not, you know,

227
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,219
a Chinese national here offering to help you reset M fa S Jerry.

228
00:09:48,229 --> 00:09:49,539
Like, you know,

229
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,739
it is a challenge that will continue to grow, right?

230
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,500
And, and by the way, that's one of the reasons I, I um

231
00:09:56,724 --> 00:10:00,854
I, I made a post that was pretty provocative and controversial in the,

232
00:10:00,864 --> 00:10:02,034
in the security community.

233
00:10:02,044 --> 00:10:02,284
I, I

234
00:10:02,405 --> 00:10:07,424
told people turn two fa on and put the two fa into a password manager.

235
00:10:08,015 --> 00:10:12,534
And, and so which is what I do and, and, and it's not the pure,

236
00:10:12,674 --> 00:10:15,705
you know, it's not the purest way of doing it because,

237
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:18,674
you know, like I don't have it on a, I mean, I do have a ya

238
00:10:18,854 --> 00:10:19,304
key

239
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,099
but I use that for like accessing the underlying infrastructure.

240
00:10:23,109 --> 00:10:27,440
But in terms of accessing, you know, like logging into websites and what not.

241
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:31,909
I have the, the two fa that the top pe the time based one time password

242
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,140
codes are in,

243
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:39,710
you know, in the profiles for my, my I DS and, and it's convenient because if I lose my,

244
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:44,900
if I lose my phone, I've got everything set up in my life, my laptop, my phone whatnot.

245
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,950
I've got everything set up in my life

246
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,349
that the device is ephemeral. I can lose my phone.

247
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,280
If you get a new phone,

248
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:56,080
I have to sign into a couple of things and I have all of my files.

249
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,630
I have all my passwords back.

250
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,280
I have to remember a couple of complicated passwords that

251
00:11:01,289 --> 00:11:03,380
would let me get back into my Onedrive account,

252
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,239
my one password account and that's it.

253
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,609
So, so that's why that's what I'm trying to encourage people

254
00:11:08,739 --> 00:11:12,539
to do because otherwise, you know, if you have an

255
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,950
a, you know, you have a,

256
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,200
an authenticator app on your phone

257
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,739
and it doesn't have the ability to sync to something else,

258
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,359
you have that problem like you will

259
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:27,039
eventually get a new phone and you will almost certainly forget to migrate them.

260
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:30,549
We had one of our devs get locked out of his Cloud Flower account and fun fact,

261
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,950
Cloud floor has that vision of your account is your account so

262
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,510
even I with control of the email domain was like they're like,

263
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,369
yeah, you can't do it like he has to fix it.

264
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:38,549
And

265
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:39,469
uh

266
00:11:39,969 --> 00:11:41,090
yeah, it was a nightmare.

267
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,500
So I think what you said,

268
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:46,270
Jerry is good advice for normal people and

269
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,390
I'm sure security people are losing their minds.

270
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:49,039
But the,

271
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:53,549
the thing I have in the back of my head at the moment is I was a last pass customer

272
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:59,909
and my safe, it was probably stolen by an attacker. And so that's the one thing

273
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,609
that

274
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,559
scares me to death

275
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,070
about putting two factor off

276
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:08,099
-- into my password manager.
-- What's, what's more likely to happen?

277
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:10,320
Oh, II, I agree completely. I mean,

278
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,599
and for people I know for normal people,

279
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:18,320
100% put it in the password manager because you're going to lose your phone,

280
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:19,179
you're going to lose your UI

281
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:20,929
key. I mean, my daughter has a UI

282
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:22,599
key. I gave her on her birthday.

283
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:24,390
She has no idea where it is.

284
00:12:25,719 --> 00:12:26,909
That's not a present.

285
00:12:27,729 --> 00:12:30,710
Shut up. That's like giving them a shovel and like pointing at the garden.

286
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:34,270
But I, I can't help but wonder if one of the things that might really help here is, is,

287
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,719
you know, the apple pass key stuff that's just coming out because

288
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,429
like, yeah, II I too, like, I've

289
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:43,140
looked like we actually have policy at the CS A where, where possible,

290
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:46,190
please save your two of a into one password

291
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:49,130
because that way when you get clobbered by a bus or something, you know,

292
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,590
the organization can access the stuff,

293
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,640
you know, it's our stuff, not really your stuff. And on a personal level.

294
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:58,510
Well, I'm stuck using Google authenticator because I'm, anyways, I feel like the,

295
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,859
the sort of long term solution here is what Apple is doing,

296
00:13:00,869 --> 00:13:04,919
which is to give people the ability to do certain things and let them pick,

297
00:13:04,929 --> 00:13:06,210
kind of like what level of security you want.

298
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:06,440
Like

299
00:13:06,729 --> 00:13:09,590
we can have the encryption keys too so we can recover your account or

300
00:13:09,849 --> 00:13:11,710
if you really want to, you can, you know,

301
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:14,789
we don't have your encryption keys in your icloud stuff is really,

302
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,109
really encrypted and like

303
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,719
it's on you to make sure you have a recovery system set up for that

304
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:21,989
and then they offer some options there to make it a bit easier.

305
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,390
Like you can link it to this other account or I

306
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,960
feel like that's kind of the way to go long term.

307
00:13:26,969 --> 00:13:27,469
And I mean, I think

308
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:28,770
Malo does a good job of

309
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,859
like it, you're forced to set up a TA

310
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:33,770
P first and then you can add hard rookies and

311
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,890
one thing it doesn't do, which I, I think it should is I've seen obviously

312
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:39,809
places that you register top people with,

313
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,169
it's like now enter a code to make sure you know that you actually set it up correctly.

314
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:44,450
I will say,

315
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:47,690
you know, Mastodon is uh it's it's free software

316
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,489
and, and I, I have, I have made, um, you know, quite a,

317
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,570
quite a number of um improvement requests including

318
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,599
in the area of two factor authentication.

319
00:13:57,609 --> 00:13:58,460
And I mean,

320
00:13:58,669 --> 00:14:00,340
I totally agree with you.

321
00:14:00,469 --> 00:14:01,500
Everything you just said,

322
00:14:01,729 --> 00:14:03,820
ok, I want to clarify something that Kurt

323
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,809
just mentioned in passing that I think is really cool.

324
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:09,020
So, in the Mastodon Universe,

325
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,869
when do you set up two factor authentication?

326
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,690
It supports uh what is it web

327
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,169
a then

328
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:17,580
Fido keys kind of whatever that I, I forget what they're calling it these days,

329
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:18,239
but

330
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:21,979
that's like a UB key for example, or a Google Titan key or one of those things.

331
00:14:21,989 --> 00:14:26,559
But before you can do that, you have to set up like a atotp.

332
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:31,690
-- Uh I forget what totp stands for but
-- time something, the password. I mm

333
00:14:32,109 --> 00:14:33,580
I don't know, I don't know, it doesn't matter

334
00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:35,909
but like, like Google authenticator off

335
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:37,090
or something on your phone.

336
00:14:37,099 --> 00:14:41,650
So you, you have to have a second kind of factor if you're using

337
00:14:41,909 --> 00:14:42,130
the

338
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:42,729
Fido keys,

339
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:46,299
which I think is cool because those things are small and they're easy to lose.

340
00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:49,570
Correct top P stands for time based one time password.

341
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:50,619
Just

342
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:52,049
there we go

343
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,299
vou two F which is what um

344
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:58,239
what Mastodon supports. And increasingly so

345
00:14:58,609 --> 00:15:00,479
it's actually pretty cool because I,

346
00:15:00,489 --> 00:15:04,380
I have a Lenovo laptop with which has the fingerprint

347
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,239
reader.

348
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,549
And what do you go up? And when you go set up a device, not only do I have my, my

349
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:10,729
uh

350
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:12,840
yi set up as a authenticator,

351
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:15,080
but also it will use the

352
00:15:15,229 --> 00:15:18,919
because it has the T PM chip in it. It will actually use

353
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:23,750
the fingerprint reader as, as a, as an authentication device.

354
00:15:24,309 --> 00:15:25,669
So when I go to log in to mass,

355
00:15:25,869 --> 00:15:29,909
then all I have to do is touch the fingerprint reader and that's, that's handy.

356
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,469
I do think by the way,

357
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:36,700
in the future, we, we have to, we have to find a way away from passwords.

358
00:15:37,109 --> 00:15:38,190
We're seeing

359
00:15:38,429 --> 00:15:39,679
some innovation,

360
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,789
you know, from the likes of Microsoft and Apple.

361
00:15:43,369 --> 00:15:45,929
And I don't know what standard will,

362
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:50,159
you know, I don't know where we're going to land in the next five or 10 years, but

363
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,750
I think where we're at right now

364
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,020
is just not a tenable place.

365
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,900
What I'm reminded of is, I think we're like,

366
00:15:55,909 --> 00:15:58,489
passwords are kind of like the horse and the solution is not more horses,

367
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,919
like the solution to passwords is not password managers.

368
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:01,530
That's not,

369
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,469
that's not, you know, like we're going to end up like knee deep in horse poop.

370
00:16:05,479 --> 00:16:07,710
We are knee deep in horse poop.

371
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:08,739
-- Yeah,
-- exactly.

372
00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:12,549
And because I mean, what really gets me about passwords is, for example, you know,

373
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:14,349
I have one of my sons has autism.

374
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:16,900
Yeah. Passwords really do not work for that guy,

375
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:21,590
you know, but being that he has an Apple iphone and with a password, you know,

376
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:22,609
fingerprint scanner.

377
00:16:22,619 --> 00:16:25,250
Yeah. Super awesome. Works just easy.

378
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,609
I mean, the one piece of good news is like Windows. Windows. Hello.

379
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,210
Now, not only supports you logging into your computer with your face,

380
00:16:30,219 --> 00:16:31,250
but it supports web off then.

381
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,719
So actually I as an option, like when I'm setting up web off, then I'm presenting,

382
00:16:34,729 --> 00:16:35,890
you know, do you want to use a security key?

383
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,690
Do you want to use your phone? Do you want to use your face?

384
00:16:38,049 --> 00:16:41,250
Like it's, it's getting there slowly and it's,

385
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,559
it's certainly easier to set up like your face and your thumb

386
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,799
as opposed to like having multiple UB keys. Right?

387
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:51,140
And so I, I'm hopeful for the future. But yeah, like,

388
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,900
like you said, we're, I think we're still a ways away.

389
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,460
All right, I'm going to be the eternal pessimist here

390
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,869
and I, I think I put something I master it on about this a couple of weeks ago,

391
00:16:59,969 --> 00:17:00,429
but

392
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,260
I have a suspicion the password of this office

393
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,780
is going to go well with the paperless office.

394
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:08,868
Well, Legacy software, right?

395
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,790
Like I have a, a person who I know who works for the government

396
00:17:11,979 --> 00:17:14,040
and they're still using AD OS based insurance program

397
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,270
that's been mangled fire into doing some other,

398
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,810
you know, kind of payment system aspect for the government.

399
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:21,510
And it doesn't even actually support passwords, technically speaking,

400
00:17:21,598 --> 00:17:23,589
like they stuck it behind a web firewall thing.

401
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,760
Yeah, I think, I think your point though is

402
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,069
as we move forward,

403
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,060
that the technology we're creating is just going to be

404
00:17:30,069 --> 00:17:33,430
generating pass passwords at more passwords at a faster rate,

405
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:36,349
just like the paperless office has generated,

406
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,819
you know,

407
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:42,130
in, in fancy ways of creating paper at an alarming pace.

408
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:44,469
You know, one of the challenges that I think we just,

409
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:47,910
we have is passwords are the least common denominator.

410
00:17:48,219 --> 00:17:51,869
And it, you know, it's every, every freaking app out there

411
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:52,619
has

412
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:54,790
a, has support for a password.

413
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,295
I mean, pretty much and,

414
00:17:56,305 --> 00:17:59,814
and it's going to take us a really long time to get away from that.

415
00:17:59,824 --> 00:18:01,415
And so we're going to be living with,

416
00:18:01,444 --> 00:18:05,125
with password managers probably through my lifetime.

417
00:18:05,135 --> 00:18:05,574
I bet.

418
00:18:06,094 --> 00:18:06,685
Well, I mean, I guess

419
00:18:06,824 --> 00:18:09,375
the good news is, it's, you know, it's built into your web browser,

420
00:18:09,385 --> 00:18:10,724
it's built into your phone system.

421
00:18:10,734 --> 00:18:12,734
It's Android ecosystem has it like.

422
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:17,229
So, II, I guess that's an improvement where it's built in by default.

423
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,510
Well, ok,

424
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:23,800
there's, I think a second piece to this is the three of us are not young gentlemen.

425
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:29,109
We'll say we, we've seen some stuff and back 20 plus years ago,

426
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:32,030
remember when everyone would roll their own authentication

427
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,969
where you just wrote your web app and you're like, oh,

428
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:37,130
I'll just put a password field here and we'll put it in the database and

429
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:38,380
maybe

430
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:40,469
you hashed it maybe,

431
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,270
probably not,

432
00:18:41,729 --> 00:18:44,900
you know, and now all the web frameworks have,

433
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:48,989
we'll say strong password handling where it has the ability to do various resets.

434
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,709
It, it hashes the crap out of it using whatever n

435
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,560
latest algorithm is

436
00:18:53,829 --> 00:18:54,300
like

437
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,390
it got easy

438
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,170
and I have a suspicion,

439
00:18:57,489 --> 00:18:59,510
whatever comes next

440
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:04,189
is going, once it makes it into the web frameworks, then we will see traction.

441
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:06,069
But I think until it's default,

442
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,469
it's just not going to happen.

443
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,550
-- I think
-- you're right.

444
00:19:08,699 --> 00:19:12,000
That's what's going to make the, the difference is make, making it, you know,

445
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,119
built into those frameworks like Lara

446
00:19:14,229 --> 00:19:14,329
O

447
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:16,660
and you know what not. That's, that's what's

448
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,229
going to drive, drive things forward.

449
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,349
I'm shocked to learn that the default setting is the one people use.

450
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:25,390
All right. All right.

451
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,339
So, so we're kind of running ourselves out of time a little bit here with you,

452
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:31,109
Jerry and I figure since we have you and you're running,

453
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:35,430
we'll say the most popular security focused Mastodon instance on the planet.

454
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,859
And I'm comfortable saying that I don't think anyone can fact check me out of it.

455
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,650
But I'm, I'm just curious, you've been doing this for five years.

456
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,180
The last two months have been madness.

457
00:19:43,189 --> 00:19:47,689
Like, tell me, tell me your thoughts on, on everything you see going on, the people,

458
00:19:47,699 --> 00:19:52,020
you're seeing the, the ecosystem, the way the software is changing.

459
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:56,170
-- I'm, I'm just, I've got you here. So I got to ask,
-- it's been a wild ride.

460
00:19:56,709 --> 00:19:59,079
You know, I, I set it up a long time ago.

461
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,520
I don't even remember why I set it up at the time.

462
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:06,040
It's just, I, I like to tinker and, um, you know, so it, it,

463
00:20:06,199 --> 00:20:12,410
it had like 100 or 200 users for the first five years. And, um, you know, and

464
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:17,849
when, when Twitter started to fall apart, um, actually, which was in the spring,

465
00:20:17,869 --> 00:20:19,689
not, not in the fall.

466
00:20:19,699 --> 00:20:24,140
The first wave was in the spring and I was actually running the server on a VPs and, um,

467
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:27,160
it just fell over like there was a, there was a,

468
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:33,189
a little mini exodus from Twitter when Elon Musk announced that he was going,

469
00:20:33,449 --> 00:20:37,130
he was going to purchase Twitter. And in this, in the server fell over.

470
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,770
And if you look at some of the up time, the long term uptime graphs of the server,

471
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,849
you'll see that it was down for like a week

472
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:43,689
and,

473
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:47,530
and, and at the time I was spending like a couple 100 bucks a month or sorry,

474
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,430
a couple 100 bucks a year on this vps.

475
00:20:49,439 --> 00:20:50,939
And so I decided to like,

476
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:55,890
you know, I'm going to buy an actual or rent an actual server and I did and, and I,

477
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,150
I figured it would be,

478
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,390
I'll probably never have to upgrade this thing again.

479
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:06,069
And then, uh, and then, you know, the, the date

480
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:10,150
October 27th when, when Alan closed the deal, there was a, just a,

481
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:15,630
I was actually at the beach working and I kept seeing like pop ups on Twitter as I was.

482
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:15,760
Um,

483
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,170
you know, I, I wasn't advertising like I was just,

484
00:21:19,449 --> 00:21:20,449
I was working,

485
00:21:20,689 --> 00:21:25,900
kept seeing pop ups on my phone from Twitter and, and then, uh I took a look and,

486
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,689
you know, it was like 1000 or 2000 new accounts.

487
00:21:28,739 --> 00:21:29,660
Anyway, we,

488
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:32,660
we grew from 100 and 80 users to about 36,000

489
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:36,050
over the course of about six or seven weeks.

490
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:41,290
Pretty exciting time at a macro level. It has been absolutely astounding

491
00:21:41,589 --> 00:21:47,489
to watch kind of this vibrant ecosystem of smart security people, like pick up

492
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,609
and move

493
00:21:48,819 --> 00:21:50,020
to a different platform

494
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:54,550
and not just on, on my, you know, on, on infosec exchange,

495
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,540
there's a bunch of other really cool,

496
00:21:56,979 --> 00:21:58,579
um you know, security

497
00:21:58,699 --> 00:22:01,859
instances, there's Defcon dot social and hacker

498
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:05,920
and hackers dot town and, and, you know, lots of really cool

499
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:11,640
uh places with, with great people, but just to watch that mass migration almost like

500
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:13,199
in total

501
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,410
pick up what, what they were doing

502
00:22:15,589 --> 00:22:16,479
and then move

503
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:17,239
and

504
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,119
all the while

505
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,280
having

506
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,680
like a pretty strong bunch of naysayers just

507
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,079
all of the flaws. Oh my gosh, it doesn't have an end to end encryption.

508
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,319
Well, you know what? Neither does Twitter. And,

509
00:22:31,979 --> 00:22:34,760
um and you know, you don't have quote tweets.

510
00:22:34,969 --> 00:22:38,069
Yep, that's a, that's a problem and the search sucks and,

511
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,119
and whatnot. But despite all of that,

512
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,550
the community that has set up is just really cool and, and I Um

513
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,040
I don't know.

514
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,910
I, I, my, my hypothesis is

515
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,170
that Twitter

516
00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:54,849
had some algorithmic

517
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,810
stuff going on that, that kind of put things

518
00:22:58,439 --> 00:22:59,300
that were

519
00:22:59,829 --> 00:23:03,770
not necessarily what you liked to see in front of your face because it drove

520
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:09,479
and as compared to, you know, that that doesn't exist

521
00:23:09,829 --> 00:23:09,959
in

522
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,479
Masan, it's just totally,

523
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,469
you're chronological

524
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:18,430
or, you know, based on the, the, the hashtags that you follow and whatnot and, and the

525
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:19,939
people

526
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,750
are amazing.

527
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:24,420
Like they're so supportive,

528
00:23:24,689 --> 00:23:25,819
they're kind

529
00:23:26,199 --> 00:23:26,770
um

530
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,579
it's just been an amazing thing to be part of.

531
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:31,599
Well,

532
00:23:31,609 --> 00:23:33,329
I can't help but wonder because it's funny to

533
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:35,010
me seeing this mass migration and I'm like,

534
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:39,540
oh, I've seen this before now, granted it took like a year or two instead of six weeks,

535
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,170
you know, for some of these platforms, like

536
00:23:41,349 --> 00:23:42,209
when uh slash

537
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:44,579
dot died, you know, that was years, right?

538
00:23:44,709 --> 00:23:47,859
Or dig or Irc you know, and

539
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,209
people migrated

540
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:53,119
off those platforms. But yeah, years, not six weeks.

541
00:23:53,589 --> 00:23:54,839
And so I can't help but wonder because like a

542
00:23:54,849 --> 00:23:57,079
lot of the people such as yourself running these instances,

543
00:23:57,089 --> 00:23:59,130
I mean, you've been through this before, like,

544
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,790
you know what eternal September is we've lived in.

545
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:03,530
And the second thing I'm really,

546
00:24:03,869 --> 00:24:05,750
what's fascinating to me is a couple of the big

547
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:08,989
hold on, hold on. Kurt. I need to interrupt you because

548
00:24:09,729 --> 00:24:12,869
a lot of people don't know what eternal September is because they're,

549
00:24:13,189 --> 00:24:16,359
they're not old enough to have been in Eternal September.

550
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,719
-- Uh
-- So basically Eternal September was the internet.

551
00:24:18,729 --> 00:24:21,609
Uh where every September a fresh crop of, you know,

552
00:24:21,619 --> 00:24:24,640
18 year olds would go to university and get internet for the first time.

553
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:24,859
And

554
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,439
you know,

555
00:24:25,709 --> 00:24:29,959
this is amazing, right? And then uh Eternal September. AOL joined the internet.

556
00:24:30,729 --> 00:24:31,849
Well, use net specific,

557
00:24:32,255 --> 00:24:36,604
right? Because AOL was on the internet and then they opened use net up and

558
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:37,444
we'll say

559
00:24:37,564 --> 00:24:40,525
the quality of use net became more questionable.

560
00:24:40,535 --> 00:24:44,645
And the other thing I've seen is a couple of major proponents that like said Mastodon

561
00:24:44,655 --> 00:24:47,005
cannot work for XY and Z reasons actually

562
00:24:47,015 --> 00:24:50,645
recant and like write relatively long sort of

563
00:24:50,964 --> 00:24:53,364
replies to themselves saying like I was wrong and

564
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:55,405
here's why I was wrong and I feel like Mastodon

565
00:24:55,415 --> 00:24:58,255
is very fundamentally different than Twitter and not just

566
00:24:58,265 --> 00:25:00,385
because it's not corporate and Federated and all that,

567
00:25:00,395 --> 00:25:00,935
but I think it's,

568
00:25:01,439 --> 00:25:04,199
there's just some aspect to it and I don't know what it is exactly,

569
00:25:04,209 --> 00:25:06,020
but it's just very different.

570
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:07,689
So it, it,

571
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,040
it comes from a different place

572
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:15,130
and, and so it was, it's been really interesting watching, especially in the early,

573
00:25:15,219 --> 00:25:17,859
the first few weeks after, you know, is,

574
00:25:17,869 --> 00:25:21,479
is the security community was starting to make its,

575
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,680
its migration

576
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,239
to, to watch people saying, oh, it's not going to work and,

577
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:29,469
but like having been doing it for five years,

578
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:32,640
like, you know, it, it works like it,

579
00:25:33,069 --> 00:25:36,930
you know, you can say that but we're over here, like, doing it and, and so that's,

580
00:25:36,939 --> 00:25:38,650
that, it's, it's kind of an odd thing.

581
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:43,400
Malware Tech, by the way was one of the ones that was a pretty big detractor of it.

582
00:25:43,869 --> 00:25:47,729
And he since wrote a, you know, pretty, pretty long piece about, you know, why he,

583
00:25:47,739 --> 00:25:49,619
he thought that was wrong and that's, you know,

584
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:50,819
that's cool.

585
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,520
Um,

586
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:56,030
look, it isn't Twitter. Right. It isn't Twitter. It has Twitter like

587
00:25:56,489 --> 00:26:00,770
capabilities, it has the ability to post messages and that people can see.

588
00:26:01,069 --> 00:26:04,729
But it was, again, it comes from a different place. It was designed

589
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,130
with some of the, you know,

590
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,890
to address what people perceived as some of the downsides of,

591
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,640
of kind of mainstream social media,

592
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:15,510
which is like the ability for people to harass each other and, and whatnot.

593
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,459
So, so some of the things that are,

594
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:21,819
are not there like quote tweets in and robust search

595
00:26:21,829 --> 00:26:25,050
and some of the other things were intentional design points

596
00:26:25,739 --> 00:26:26,119
that,

597
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:32,630
you know, we're, we're, we're there to help mitigate or govern some of the, you know,

598
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,050
the the the problematic aspects of other social media, you know,

599
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:39,060
having said that like it also is in those things are

600
00:26:39,069 --> 00:26:42,109
a bit of an inhibitor for from a usability standpoint.

601
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:42,500
So

602
00:26:42,619 --> 00:26:44,859
like they, it wasn't accidental that twit

603
00:26:44,989 --> 00:26:47,369
had those things, they were pretty damn handy.

604
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:51,729
Now, I'm going to say the no quote tweets bothered me for a while,

605
00:26:51,739 --> 00:26:54,709
but I actually really like it because now I can't just like,

606
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:57,130
quote tweet someone and throw shade on them or whatever.

607
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,969
I have to actually reply and engage like a human.

608
00:26:59,979 --> 00:27:03,119
And I definitely think more about what I'm doing

609
00:27:03,349 --> 00:27:03,969
than

610
00:27:04,219 --> 00:27:05,949
maybe some of the hot takes

611
00:27:06,069 --> 00:27:07,170
we got in the past.

612
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,250
That's exactly it. Right. That is it.

613
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:12,270
That's the, that's the reason.

614
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:13,530
Yeah.

615
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:16,510
Yeah. Absolutely. All right, Jerry, one last thing I want to ask about.

616
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:20,359
So you're now running a pretty beefy instance. And I'm curious,

617
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,719
tell me about

618
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,939
how the community is helping kind of fund all this

619
00:27:24,949 --> 00:27:27,199
because that this is the coolest part I think.

620
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:27,410
Yeah.

621
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:33,560
So, um I uh I just received my first bill from post,

622
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,709
what I call the post deflationary period.

623
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:39,760
And it was, uh it was 28 $900 for, for a month.

624
00:27:40,729 --> 00:27:41,380
So,

625
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:45,630
yeah, it was, um now the thing to understand was

626
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:46,479
I,

627
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:51,930
you know, at the time, you know, I had about 100 and $10 a month server and I, you know,

628
00:27:51,939 --> 00:27:53,030
I thought that that

629
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:56,479
will last me for quite some time or maybe forever

630
00:27:57,189 --> 00:28:02,250
and, and it lasted till about 8000 users, which was not bad,

631
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,329
but I was, we were adding 2000 users a day

632
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:07,829
and

633
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:12,739
I was in this like constant firefighting mode of holy crap.

634
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:16,400
We're running out of file descriptors. Holy crap. We're out of memory. Holy crap.

635
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:19,920
We're out of this space. Holy and, and So I said this is enough.

636
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:24,150
And I went and I, you know, I rented some significant,

637
00:28:24,859 --> 00:28:26,869
I had no idea when it was going to stop.

638
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,910
And, and so the community

639
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,270
has been amazing. I set up, it's called Libra Pay.

640
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,160
It gives you the ability to, to like make a,

641
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,890
a recurring commitment.

642
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:43,250
And um and so so between that and paypal, I'm able to cover, to cover the server costs.

643
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,609
I just moved from a self hosted media storage

644
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,040
to um

645
00:28:49,219 --> 00:28:54,910
to a CD N and, and back plays S3. Uh So, so now I don't have to worry about

646
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:58,209
many o taking a dump in the middle of the night,

647
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,119
which it often did by the way.

648
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:03,280
And, but, you know, that's expensive.

649
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:08,010
Like I, I'm literally sitting at my desk and watching like, OK,

650
00:29:08,209 --> 00:29:13,089
you know, 1.1 terabytes, 1.2 terabytes, 1.3 terabytes, 1.4 ter

651
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:18,260
like going out through the CD N and, and uh you know, I, I uh you prepay.

652
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:20,599
And so I'm like watching the, the money

653
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,119
that

654
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:21,369
I

655
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,420
that I put in

656
00:29:22,579 --> 00:29:23,479
like decrement.

657
00:29:23,859 --> 00:29:28,400
And so it's been, it's look, I, I didn't do this to make money.

658
00:29:28,729 --> 00:29:29,880
I have a pretty

659
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:32,670
good job. I'm a really good job.

660
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:37,849
I did, I do this because II I believe in the community, but it's been really cool

661
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,979
to see the community come together and um

662
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:44,699
and support it financially so that I've been so

663
00:29:45,109 --> 00:29:48,209
-- honored to be part of that.
-- Absolutely. It's,

664
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,270
I love it.

665
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,760
It feels like all of the right things,

666
00:29:51,819 --> 00:29:57,020
all the things I read from you and all the other Mastodon server hosts and it's just,

667
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,369
it, it brings a smile

668
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,609
to my face every time I read about it.

669
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:05,050
And I will say like I was very beaten down for a long time

670
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,920
about just like the state of the internet and social media and everything.

671
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,699
And I think everything I've seen happening right now with,

672
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:14,910
with Mastodon and the fetters and everything like fills me with hope that like,

673
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,339
I don't think it's a lost cause anymore, which makes

674
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,589
it makes me so happy.

675
00:30:18,869 --> 00:30:20,500
-- It's
-- uh you know, it's like,

676
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:24,060
uh it's like going from a dystopian world to like Star Trek.

677
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:25,050
You know, it's like,

678
00:30:25,729 --> 00:30:28,709
well, I think what gets me is that this looks to be sustainable.

679
00:30:28,719 --> 00:30:31,729
I mean, like three grand a month, that's a big server bill.

680
00:30:31,739 --> 00:30:34,969
But when I think about like 20 years ago, what it cost to run a website,

681
00:30:35,239 --> 00:30:38,099
we would have been so happy to only pay three grand a month, right?

682
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:42,829
And three grand a month to support 36,000 users. Granted, not all of them are active.

683
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:43,270
That's

684
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,790
I feel like that's actually sustainable, especially if people are,

685
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,859
-- you know, donating a bit of money.
-- Like, yeah, yeah.

686
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:51,739
All right. I'm gonna call this one, Jerry.

687
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,140

693
