Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,630
Kurt Siefried and my partner and

2
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:13,819
I'm actually not really sure what this is today. Uh Josh

3
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,629
-- Reser,
-- it could be thought crime. Thought crime's pretty nonspecifi.

4
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,100
-- II, I dare say we both.
-- Well, I don't want to imply that a crime took place here.

5
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,180
-- Well,
-- we're both engaging in thought crime on a regular basis. I'm sure.

6
00:00:26,389 --> 00:00:26,940
So,

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,620
-- what was that?
-- It's a beer

8
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:33,770
that seems appropriate.

9
00:00:33,779 --> 00:00:37,419
I don't know how your first week of 2022 is gone, but I'm having a beer.

10
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,279
It's been a treat. I, uh,

11
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:44,250
that's good. That means editing. You later will be a, a joyful experience for me.

12
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:47,130
-- Well,
-- this is why I'm having the beer now and I didn't have it an hour ago

13
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:51,419
anyway.

14
00:00:51,779 --> 00:00:55,479
It's actually when, for what it's worth when this episode comes out,

15
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,040
it will be the second full week of 2022.

16
00:00:58,049 --> 00:00:58,599
So

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,279
the future us hopefully are having a much better week than we are at the moment.

18
00:01:03,419 --> 00:01:04,569
I don't want to be all doom and gloom,

19
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,339
but with the way the charts look in school actually going back in tomorrow.

20
00:01:08,629 --> 00:01:09,029
Yeah. That

21
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:09,319
too.

22
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,639
I hate to say this on to a happier topic.

23
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:15,160
A me

24
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,319
so first the disclaimer,

25
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,080
we're not going to go into the the gory details of this because

26
00:01:20,089 --> 00:01:23,550
there's a whole bunch of gory details that actually are not all that germane

27
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,930
to what happened and the outfall or the consequences of it.

28
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,519
And I think the outfall and the consequences are the most interesting in many ways.

29
00:01:31,919 --> 00:01:32,699
Yep. Yep.

30
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,629
Alright. Just spit it out. What happened.

31
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:40,480
A developer called Merrick is responsible for color dot Js and uh faker dot Js,

32
00:01:40,489 --> 00:01:43,860
which are two very, very popular javascript packages.

33
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,230
Uh color dot Js does colors on the console,

34
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,550
which personally I don't get because I like my consoles.

35
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:51,290
-- Monochromatic colors
-- are awesome man.

36
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,470
-- Come on, I get that,
-- but I'm old and I like monochromatic whatever.

37
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,110
I love my color and faker dot Js is arguably quite useful. It generates fake data

38
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:02,000
for like testing stuff, so addresses names,

39
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:02,949
pets, whatever.

40
00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:03,830
Right. Right.

41
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,669
Let's go with the simplified version of this.

42
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,110
He got fed up with fortune 500 companies and whatnot, you know,

43
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:09,788
strongly benefiting from this.

44
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,300
And so apparently at some point he tried to do sort

45
00:02:13,309 --> 00:02:15,889
of software as a service version of faker dot Js,

46
00:02:15,899 --> 00:02:18,009
you know, so essentially have it as a service.

47
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,669
Cool,

48
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:23,169
except then a large company literally just like Lock stock and barrel ripped

49
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:26,360
and stole it and did it as a service as a software.

50
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:29,820
Obviously more successful because a company versus an individual,

51
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,369
typically the company wins, you know, they have more marketing, more

52
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,600
sales, blah, blah, blah.

53
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,160
Right.

54
00:02:35,369 --> 00:02:38,009
I'm sorry. That's just how it is. So basically,

55
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,690
let's go with you through a tantrum

56
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:41,199
and he

57
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:45,940
released new versions of faker Js and color dot Js version 6.6 0.6.

58
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:46,070
0,

59
00:02:47,309 --> 00:02:47,990
and

60
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,210
I don't know if he did anything malicious in fake or Js, but in color dot Js,

61
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,110
he actually added an infinite loop like

62
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:56,130
and it's really obvious it's called infinite,

63
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:57,529
it says infinite loop

64
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,130
and it just loops infinitely.

65
00:03:00,339 --> 00:03:02,679
And he basically broke the code and then the faker

66
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,839
dot Js and color dot Js Repos on github,

67
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:08,029
he basically wiped them. Now, the color dot Js Repo has been

68
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:13,350
restored. The faker dot Js Repo as of this time is still like wiped

69
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,160
and github

70
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:16,520
has apparently locked him out of his account and N

71
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,449
PM has apparently locked him out of his account and both

72
00:03:19,945 --> 00:03:24,565
N PM has restored color dot Js and faker dot Js so that they kind of work now

73
00:03:25,294 --> 00:03:27,494
because they both have faker dot Js had,

74
00:03:27,505 --> 00:03:30,865
I think it was about 2500 and change dependent packages and

75
00:03:30,934 --> 00:03:35,464
color dot Js had around it was 3100 something dependent packages,

76
00:03:35,684 --> 00:03:36,035
right?

77
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:39,475
And I'll be curious to see if that number drops in the next week or two. I doubt it.

78
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,419
Uh

79
00:03:41,029 --> 00:03:43,940
probably not like a handful but nothing meaningful.

80
00:03:45,149 --> 00:03:46,740
It's not like half of them are going to move

81
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,320
to chalk or whatever other color library there is.

82
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,520
And so,

83
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,850
yeah, I mean, what's interesting to me is there's,

84
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,429
there's several dimensions to this.

85
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,330
Right. There's like, sort of the moral, ethical thing.

86
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,559
There's the practical and effective issue, there's

87
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,570
sort of the business, the community, the, well,

88
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,229
and the trust issue that especially the trust in upstream.

89
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,080
-- So, I guess where do you want to start? I want to
-- start by talking about P

90
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:13,199
ah, yeah.

91
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,509
Right. Ok.

92
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:15,490
Karen. It is.

93
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,608
If

94
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,350
any of our viewers familiar with Penny Arcade,

95
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,640
the whole P thing is not going to be a surprise.

96
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,089
We have listeners, not, not viewers. All right.

97
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,000
So there's a comic, I'm going to put in the show notes and

98
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,559
this is really old, like, it's from 2005

99
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,320
and

100
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:37,420
there's a web comic called Penny Arcade that will say is

101
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:43,010
a bit on the edgy side would be a polite description and, and even as they've aged,

102
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:48,890
-- they've maintained their just absurdity, which I love
-- his online anonymity.

103
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:50,700
An asshole cartoon is like,

104
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:53,480
-- I mean,
-- that, that's one of the best by far.

105
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:57,839
-- People are going to be studying that in 1000 years.
-- Oh, well, hopefully.

106
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,350
But, yes, yes, absolutely.

107
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:04,609
There's some amazing penny arcade comics that I, I adore. And anyway,

108
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,459
so what happened was

109
00:05:06,859 --> 00:05:09,989
Will Wright is the person behind

110
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:14,660
like simcity and spo and Sim Ant and all those kind of weird simulation,

111
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,220
man. I totally forgot about Sim An.

112
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:16,950
Yeah. Right.

113
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,269
There's a bunch of them and they're,

114
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:22,179
they're amazing games and why we put the games in quotes.

115
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:22,549
Right.

116
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:23,369
So, anyways

117
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,019
Farm was a game. It was awesome. It was the best.

118
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:29,799
When Will Wright announced Four Penny Arcade created this

119
00:05:29,809 --> 00:05:32,500
comic and I'm just gonna read it because it's,

120
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,019
it, I think it captures

121
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:34,890
an

122
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:38,890
aspect of this. I mean, we're just gonna read it. So this is Will Wright speaking

123
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:43,899
in uh in the Penny Arcade comic, right? It says, so this is my new game pee.

124
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:44,619
Basically,

125
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,140
I'm going to pee on every one of you and you're going to love every second of it.

126
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,420
That's my design

127
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:54,059
and you decide what you want to do with the pee. We're not telling you how to enjoy it.

128
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,679
I leave that up to you guys.

129
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,320
You're going to create your own unique experiences with my pee.

130
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,779
You're all going to do something different. Maybe I'll get some pee in your hair.

131
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,100
How will you react to that?

132
00:06:04,109 --> 00:06:04,820
This guy,

133
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:08,339
he might get some pee in his eye that's completely different from pee in your hair.

134
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,940
And that's exciting to me as a game designer

135
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:14,799
and then it shows a crowd screaming will write, please pee on us.

136
00:06:15,049 --> 00:06:19,399
Now, here's why I think this is relevant to the conversation.

137
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,850
Not only because I get to say the word pee over and over again,

138
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,489
but

139
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:26,029
I think from the context of kind of open source.

140
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:28,950
We like to always think of open source as

141
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,670
an entity in the universe

142
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:34,190
and we are kind of consuming it.

143
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:37,549
But I think open source is an experience

144
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,899
and it's up to each individual

145
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:45,929
company or person or whatever as to how they engage in that experience.

146
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,309
And in the context of this conversation,

147
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:54,950
if you're using, say N PM and all you're doing is sucking in latest as fast as you can.

148
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,559
What happened today is kind of what's gonna happen.

149
00:06:59,649 --> 00:06:59,989
Yeah.

150
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,149
Well, and somebody's pointed out,

151
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,200
you know what if he'd put in like an RM hyphen RF slash star in there?

152
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:06,040
Yeah. Right.

153
00:07:06,049 --> 00:07:09,850
Because I mean, you're executing this code, it can, it could wipe your hard drive,

154
00:07:09,859 --> 00:07:10,390
it could

155
00:07:10,549 --> 00:07:12,500
run a crypto miner, it could

156
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,829
whatever, all sorts of bad.

157
00:07:16,739 --> 00:07:18,239
I mean, and that's,

158
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,420
I think part of the conversation but not something I want to focus on.

159
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:24,200
I think it's more so just the aspect of

160
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,600
in the open source universe,

161
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,559
things are going to happen that are outside of your control.

162
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,279
And if you're not doing anything about that,

163
00:07:32,429 --> 00:07:36,920
eventually your stuff is going to break, it's going to light on fire and collapse.

164
00:07:37,049 --> 00:07:40,920
This is, this speaks to the efficiency argument that I made some notes on.

165
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,769
So why did open source win? Well, open source one

166
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,329
because efficiency

167
00:07:45,489 --> 00:07:47,760
and I don't mean just the efficiency of, oh, you know,

168
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:50,070
we need a web library that does this horrifically, oh,

169
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,489
horrifically complicated thing,

170
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,290
like downloading a web page which like if you do this from scratch and trust me,

171
00:07:55,299 --> 00:07:56,649
you'll, it's complicated.

172
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,799
Curl is well worth the price of admission, which is zero.

173
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:00,769
And so

174
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,040
not only do you get,

175
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,130
like you get an amazing library that is

176
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,350
actively maintained has new features for well free.

177
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:07,869
And

178
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,489
it's more than that I remember back in the day I had

179
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:13,619
uh Linux box

180
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:15,709
and I had a copy of the Linux source code on it

181
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,589
because well, I had to, how else did I upgrade my Linux kernel?

182
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:19,790
And,

183
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,269
and I had to upgrade my Linux kernel because my

184
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:24,790
machine would crash on average every 15 to 20 minutes.

185
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:25,790
And then actually,

186
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:28,070
it started only crashing every couple of hours because

187
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:30,230
the uh the Ethernet drivers got a lot better,

188
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:33,349
but I had to maintain a copy of the source code locally.

189
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,330
For the simple reason is I,

190
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,340
I couldn't download all of it every time an update came out.

191
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:40,669
So I would download, you know, the dips. Remember they would

192
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,619
your 2490

193
00:08:43,058 --> 00:08:46,789
600 bod, my friend had 2400 bod. So for my friend, it was actually faster

194
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,340
to compile a kernel on my system and then download the binary to his system.

195
00:08:50,369 --> 00:08:55,190
This is right. You told this story on a fast episode, you'd use your bicycles to,

196
00:08:55,489 --> 00:08:58,789
these aren't even bicycles, these are shoes full of sharp. Rocks.

197
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:00,299
Right.

198
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,719
Anyway, the point is

199
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,460
I, I had to keep a copy of the look of the source code because I just,

200
00:09:05,469 --> 00:09:07,349
I literally didn't have the patience and time to

201
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:10,049
download it new every time because it took hours.

202
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:10,979
And

203
00:09:11,729 --> 00:09:12,989
that has changed bandwidth.

204
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,770
I mean, right now,

205
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,390
the slowest internet I use is basically my cell phone

206
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,539
which is in the tens of megabits per second.

207
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,690
The Wi Fi at my house is somewhere in the 2

208
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,200
to 300 depending on where you are in the house.

209
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,140
And if you're wired in, it's like 970

210
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,909
megabits per second, right? It's basically gigabit.

211
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:28,119
And

212
00:09:28,929 --> 00:09:31,020
so the world changed and

213
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:32,190
here's the thing,

214
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,739
even if I store one bit of data now I have to worry about backing it up.

215
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,789
I have to worry about deleting it. I have to worry about the safety of it.

216
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,190
I have to worry about the security of it.

217
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:41,710
Whereas if I have a build system that's just like go

218
00:09:41,729 --> 00:09:44,109
suck down all this data every single time you run.

219
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah. Who cares anymore?

220
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:49,080
Uh Yeah. Yeah. Actually it's funny you say that.

221
00:09:49,219 --> 00:09:49,859
So

222
00:09:50,359 --> 00:09:50,530
a

223
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:54,559
acco the company I work for has these, we have these two tools called Sift and Gripe,

224
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,830
right? And Sift is a S bomb generator. Gripe is a vulnerability scanner.

225
00:09:59,239 --> 00:09:59,859
And

226
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,539
every now and then we,

227
00:10:01,549 --> 00:10:04,429
we kind of look at our download statistics and whatnot and

228
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,219
like they're obviously kind of bananas but at the same time.

229
00:10:07,229 --> 00:10:11,070
It's like how many of these are just, you know, like C I pipelines literally red,

230
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,900
downloading it every time they need it.

231
00:10:12,909 --> 00:10:16,299
-- And the answer is probably a lot,
-- probably 99%.

232
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,570
And, and part of it too is, is that's possible now because

233
00:10:19,739 --> 00:10:21,539
like, I used to host

234
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,500
on a dedicated 14 4 dial up line.

235
00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:25,570
Yeah,

236
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,289
I, I did the same thing. I,

237
00:10:29,409 --> 00:10:33,710
I actually, I think I was on 2088 back in the day. But yeah, yeah,

238
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,460
I couldn't afford to rent a server

239
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,830
and you needed a dedicated phone line. You needed a

240
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:40,400
de,

241
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:44,609
you had to pay the ISP way more for a dedicated connection.

242
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,169
Like 300 bucks a month.

243
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,719
Well, I worked for the IP. So I think I got it for less than 100

244
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,219
and it was slip. No, we had PPP

245
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,469
at the one I was at.

246
00:10:53,604 --> 00:10:58,104
Oh, well, yeah, I had P pe eventually but like that was the dream. I started with slip.

247
00:10:59,005 --> 00:10:59,474
But anyways,

248
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:02,125
the point is like it hosting a megabyte of data

249
00:11:02,135 --> 00:11:04,094
and serving it to a couple 100 people a month.

250
00:11:04,104 --> 00:11:06,565
Not a day, not an hour, not a minute, but a month.

251
00:11:06,885 --> 00:11:08,544
Used to be a major endeavor.

252
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:10,554
And then things like sourceforge

253
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:12,965
came along and well, unfortunately, created out.

254
00:11:12,974 --> 00:11:15,784
But sourceforge was amazing because it's like, wait, wait, wait, wait,

255
00:11:15,794 --> 00:11:20,065
I can release this 100 or 200 kilobyte tar ball

256
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,000
and like, you'll just host it and give it away for free for me.

257
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:24,780
Yeah.

258
00:11:24,929 --> 00:11:26,349
And now, like github

259
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:31,799
complains slightly once you hit a 50 megabyte per file. And I think

260
00:11:31,969 --> 00:11:36,390
the repos max out at a couple of gigs before they tell you to spend more money.

261
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:38,140
They won't tell you exactly where

262
00:11:38,289 --> 00:11:41,119
that's one of their, like, secret metrics.

263
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:42,880
But, yeah, something like that.

264
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:43,359
So,

265
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,380
it's possible now, right, like, 20 years ago,

266
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,739
it would not have been possible to download

267
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,679
this stuff 20,000 times because the server hosting,

268
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:50,739
it would have died.

269
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,219
And there was no centralized services like the, well, there were,

270
00:11:54,229 --> 00:11:55,049
but there were things like C

271
00:11:55,219 --> 00:11:57,340
A the comprehensive Pearl archive network and I mean,

272
00:11:57,349 --> 00:12:00,679
it was actually comprehensive because there was just so little.

273
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:04,460
So I, I, before we go on, I want to tell a great story about C

274
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:04,710
A

275
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:05,739
is

276
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,179
I remember

277
00:12:07,289 --> 00:12:09,869
I would run CP pan to install.

278
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,859
Usually it was in my SQL module because that's

279
00:12:12,869 --> 00:12:15,159
like the one thing I seem to use every time

280
00:12:15,489 --> 00:12:15,979
and

281
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:17,859
every now and then C

282
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:20,900
A would decide the version of Pearl I had was too old

283
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:24,099
and it would download this Pearl source code and start building it.

284
00:12:24,309 --> 00:12:29,059
And it's like, what are you doing? You psychopathic program?

285
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,940
And it was like, but that's just that, that, that

286
00:12:32,109 --> 00:12:36,099
explains Pearl. I think better than anything else possibly could.

287
00:12:36,109 --> 00:12:37,429
And back in the day this

288
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:41,830
like when you run brew on a modern Mac laptop on a modern internet feed and

289
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,909
Brew decides to update itself and download and

290
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:46,150
compile several 100 megabytes of source code.

291
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,429
That's fine on a modern laptop.

292
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,710
Except the problem is that modern laptop is equivalent to

293
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,390
pretty much all the compute power in North America.

294
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:56,190
Back in the nineties

295
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:57,190
building, Pearl

296
00:12:57,349 --> 00:13:02,349
-- was like a 3.5 hour endeavor
-- building Linux kernel. I mean,

297
00:13:03,153 --> 00:13:05,942
I remember having to build up DH CP DNS.

298
00:13:06,463 --> 00:13:07,942
Anyway. Anyway, we're up on a business.

299
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:11,252
The point is the world has fundamentally changed where

300
00:13:11,453 --> 00:13:14,223
the efficiency of open source, the fact that it's hosted for free,

301
00:13:14,232 --> 00:13:15,932
the fact that you can just download it every time

302
00:13:15,953 --> 00:13:17,583
and you don't even have to keep a local copy.

303
00:13:17,593 --> 00:13:18,172
You don't even

304
00:13:18,302 --> 00:13:22,393
bother to keep a local cash because who cares? Oh, it's an extra seven seconds.

305
00:13:22,403 --> 00:13:25,643
Well, we care now because everything broke

306
00:13:26,062 --> 00:13:27,482
well and it would have broke

307
00:13:27,653 --> 00:13:28,203
in most cases.

308
00:13:28,255 --> 00:13:30,995
This is for most people anyways because they also specify,

309
00:13:31,005 --> 00:13:32,476
get me the latest version.

310
00:13:32,726 --> 00:13:35,306
And that's the other thing, right? Software didn't used to change much.

311
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:39,786
Like I remember buying software on CD and getting updates quarterly or yearly and,

312
00:13:39,796 --> 00:13:40,635
and that was fine.

313
00:13:40,835 --> 00:13:42,125
Now you build us.

314
00:13:42,135 --> 00:13:43,375
I'm making air quotes here,

315
00:13:43,385 --> 00:13:46,556
a simple web app and it's thousands of dependencies that are getting updated

316
00:13:46,565 --> 00:13:48,036
on average every couple of minutes

317
00:13:48,046 --> 00:13:50,075
because thousands of dependencies being updated,

318
00:13:50,085 --> 00:13:52,236
you know, every couple of days works out to

319
00:13:52,426 --> 00:13:53,255
quite quick.

320
00:13:53,546 --> 00:13:56,556
Statistically speaking, it's gonna be a lot.

321
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:00,669
And so if you pin dependencies, upgrading becomes basically impossible.

322
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:04,270
So you just have it say go latest and you hope it doesn't break.

323
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,390
And I mean, this is the world we live in now.

324
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,229
You know, this is the every like this is the ocean

325
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:09,869
and

326
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,030
changing it.

327
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:11,750
Ok.

328
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,820
Well, no, no, no, it's not though.

329
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:18,229
So here's where I think we get into this, that funny comic

330
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:18,950
is,

331
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,140
this is part of the treating open sources as

332
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,869
an experience versus open source is a thing.

333
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:27,799
So the experience you're talking about is just running latest

334
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:29,830
and accepting the fact that things are going to break.

335
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,549
Generally things don't break because the

336
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:34,000
maintainer decided to purposely break them.

337
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,630
Usually things break because

338
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:39,500
maybe an api changed or maybe the feature was added or taken away.

339
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:44,039
Oh, we just had one where they did a a semantic non major change,

340
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,880
-- but they made a major breaking change,
-- right?

341
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,590
It happens, right? It happens.

342
00:14:47,989 --> 00:14:50,090
So you can decide

343
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,130
you're going to take the attitude of like what

344
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,440
Google does where when we talked to Dan Lawrence,

345
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,539
what it feels like seven years ago right now.

346
00:14:56,549 --> 00:14:57,830
And I think it was a couple of months,

347
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,440
but

348
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,549
it was

349
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,710
a situation where Google is

350
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:05,710
pulling in all the source code and basically blessing it and saying this is

351
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,450
this is what you can use,

352
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:09,109
go and use it.

353
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:13,119
-- But that requires a degree of competency and operational maintenance that
-- Oh,

354
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:13,429
yeah.

355
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,000
Yeah. Yeah.

356
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,830
Like seven companies can do.

357
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,349
No, I absolutely.

358
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:18,710
And I mean,

359
00:15:19,099 --> 00:15:24,109
this is the, the, but however I will say the options you have now are limited is

360
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:25,719
you can

361
00:15:25,849 --> 00:15:28,250
say we can only use certain versions and now there's a

362
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,400
lot of tools that let you do stuff like that today.

363
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:33,119
I don't remember them off the top of my head, but like they exist,

364
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,510
you don't have to be Googled to do it.

365
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,849
-- You can go find some vendors and work with
-- them. Actually.

366
00:15:36,859 --> 00:15:40,729
Not that much money and, and have all the artifacts copied and compiled and,

367
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,359
and arguably, I mean, that's what Red Hat did.

368
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,599
You just pay a company like

369
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,119
-- hat for this,
-- basically.

370
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,309
Well, you can't though, because Red Hat has a very limited supply.

371
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,489
Well, I mean, for stuff that Red Hat ships, you can do it.

372
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,690
You can just pay Red Hat and they,

373
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:56,489
but, yeah, but I think the world is way bigger than that now.

374
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,539
Like, if you're doing work in N PM,

375
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,890
you can't say,

376
00:16:00,229 --> 00:16:04,369
uh, here's a list of N PM things I trust. Like that's just, that's not practical.

377
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:08,630
-- Yeah. Limit yourself to what rell ate shifts. Good luck. Yeah.
-- Right.

378
00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:09,419
Right.

379
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:11,909
I don't even know if they have note in Brell anymore.

380
00:16:12,289 --> 00:16:12,650
But

381
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:15,690
you, you kind of get the idea. Right. And, and so you,

382
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:16,090
you,

383
00:16:16,099 --> 00:16:18,460
you've created this situation where now you have

384
00:16:18,469 --> 00:16:21,049
to decide what is the open source experience?

385
00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:23,109
I want my developers to have and

386
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:27,580
I think Wild West is cheapest and easiest, but things are gonna break.

387
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,530
-- I would say
-- it's not so much Wild West. I would say it's

388
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,419
whatever the defaults are,

389
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:34,109
that's what 99% of people will end up with because

390
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:36,460
they don't even know that something else is possible.

391
00:16:36,469 --> 00:16:37,979
And I, I think that's

392
00:16:38,093 --> 00:16:41,942
a viable excuse when we're talking about the general public.

393
00:16:42,242 --> 00:16:45,273
But I think when you're talking about, say in enterprise,

394
00:16:45,562 --> 00:16:47,593
they're never going to run the defaults.

395
00:16:47,603 --> 00:16:50,432
They're going to tailor it to do exactly what they want it to do.

396
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:50,773
Yeah.

397
00:16:50,783 --> 00:16:54,192
-- But
-- there's a ton of SM BS and consultant and, well, the thing you got to remember,

398
00:16:54,203 --> 00:16:56,802
consultants are consultants going to do the right thing or do the cheap thing,

399
00:16:56,872 --> 00:16:58,552
they're going to do what's best for them,

400
00:16:58,973 --> 00:17:00,992
like whatever that means.

401
00:17:01,703 --> 00:17:03,793
I, no, and here's the thing

402
00:17:04,286 --> 00:17:04,656
is

403
00:17:04,845 --> 00:17:08,645
the, one of the few arguments is that you don't have to use this stuff.

404
00:17:08,656 --> 00:17:11,015
Like you can opt out like it's, it's open source. It's free.

405
00:17:11,026 --> 00:17:12,205
You don't have to go use it.

406
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,935
The flip side to this argument though is that

407
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:16,734
no longer works because of the dependency chains?

408
00:17:16,755 --> 00:17:17,576
-- No,
-- I, I agree.

409
00:17:17,586 --> 00:17:20,605
I think saying you don't have to use open source is I,

410
00:17:20,615 --> 00:17:23,156
I don't even know how you can make that argument.

411
00:17:23,336 --> 00:17:26,435
Well, I don't mean that you have to or don't have to use open source, but, I mean,

412
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:29,765
specific packages, like, let's say you're a die hard chalk fan.

413
00:17:30,109 --> 00:17:33,050
I think it's called chalk and you don't want to use Color dot Js.

414
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,489
Yeah. Too bad.

415
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,680
The minute you pull in a dependency, some,

416
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:40,290
one of those things is going to be in a chain where color dot Js gets yanked in,

417
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,699
I mean. Sure. But, right.

418
00:17:41,709 --> 00:17:44,530
Do you really care about what a dependency of

419
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,569
a dependency of a dependency is pulling in?

420
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:49,689
Well, that's what I'm saying is even if you do care, you can't do, you can't, it,

421
00:17:49,699 --> 00:17:50,849
it's too bad.

422
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:52,430
Sure. Right.

423
00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:53,410
And so

424
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,469
that, that argument that you kind of get to pick and choose what open source you use

425
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:02,250
doesn't work in this world of 1000 or 10,000 whatever deep dependency chains.

426
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:06,089
I, I don't think anyone cares though either. I think here's the thing

427
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:11,170
if I'm writing an application and I say I want to use colors instead of chalk,

428
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,170
I'm gonna do that,

429
00:18:12,449 --> 00:18:16,280
but it's something else I pull in uses chalk instead.

430
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,560
I don't care. Why would I care?

431
00:18:18,699 --> 00:18:23,469
Uh I think there were some people with respect to what was it called? Log logging.

432
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:25,319
Something in Java for

433
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:26,130
Log

434
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,599
for Jay is a completely different story, I think.

435
00:18:28,699 --> 00:18:32,920
And again, you're not gonna say, oh, I want to use this other log

436
00:18:33,175 --> 00:18:37,354
library even though there isn't another one in Java. But like, you know what I mean?

437
00:18:37,364 --> 00:18:40,234
You just, you're solving a problem with the dependency.

438
00:18:40,295 --> 00:18:43,675
What exists beneath the dependency. You don't care.

439
00:18:43,685 --> 00:18:45,935
Well, and that's what I mean is, it's, even if you did care,

440
00:18:45,944 --> 00:18:47,064
you can't do anything about

441
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:49,224
it. And that, that's,

442
00:18:49,604 --> 00:18:50,704
yeah, that's where we are.

443
00:18:50,814 --> 00:18:52,185
You know, it's, it's like my car.

444
00:18:52,194 --> 00:18:54,635
I bought a car and I'm sure there are parts in there from

445
00:18:54,645 --> 00:18:58,214
some company I've never heard of who probably has a CEO that has,

446
00:18:58,444 --> 00:19:00,994
you know, a worldview that I would disagree strongly with.

447
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:02,329
Well,

448
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,650
too bad. I don't get to know where my fasteners came from.

449
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:09,109
-- I
-- mean, and you don't care, like you bought a car, you didn't buy fasteners.

450
00:19:09,219 --> 00:19:09,699
Yeah, open

451
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:11,250
source one because of efficiency

452
00:19:11,449 --> 00:19:15,770
and, and this stuff when it works is horrifically amazingly efficient,

453
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:20,619
especially compared to, you know, the old school, close source style of behavior.

454
00:19:20,989 --> 00:19:23,050
And what also gets me is just

455
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:26,689
like the accessibility in the sense of you can just grab it and go

456
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:27,849
and start building

457
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:30,280
and, and, you know, we've discussed this before where

458
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:31,540
you don't need to be an engineer.

459
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,099
You don't have to have certification and you can build something

460
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:37,199
like an amazing website that 10 billion people use by next Thursday.

461
00:19:37,229 --> 00:19:39,400
And do we want to live in the world of boring, safe,

462
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:43,800
slow progression or in this insane world of, you know, where we are now?

463
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:46,810
I mean, look, everyone wants

464
00:19:46,949 --> 00:19:49,219
the amazing speed

465
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:52,500
and efficiency we have today and I think

466
00:19:52,939 --> 00:19:53,500
this is no

467
00:19:53,939 --> 00:19:54,319
car crashes.

468
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,430
Well, I mean.

469
00:19:55,959 --> 00:20:00,579
Yeah, no one wants to have car crashes but they're, they're gonna happen.

470
00:20:00,689 --> 00:20:01,180
I mean,

471
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,189
but again, this comes back to,

472
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:07,530
it's up to you to make decisions about what you want your experience to be. Like,

473
00:20:07,949 --> 00:20:11,439
if you want more safety than you get just running current,

474
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:15,270
you can do that. The options exist but they're not free.

475
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,510
-- They're gonna cost you money and
-- I'm gonna,

476
00:20:18,199 --> 00:20:19,630
I'm gonna slightly disagree on. But

477
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,819
again, I think most people don't even know that that's a possibility.

478
00:20:22,829 --> 00:20:26,760
And I agree with that. I think a lot. Well, they're gonna find out

479
00:20:28,819 --> 00:20:29,119
but

480
00:20:29,699 --> 00:20:30,920
the issue in github

481
00:20:31,109 --> 00:20:33,689
with the number of people complaining and, you know,

482
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:37,449
being told to go to issue number 285, which is the sort of the, the first one

483
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,920
is Yeah. No, clearly like

484
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:42,349
it's, there's well and, and it,

485
00:20:42,489 --> 00:20:46,599
what gets me is I keep coming back to, you know, this sort of boiling the ocean slash

486
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:51,199
like if a developer makes a breaking change in a popular open source package,

487
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:53,630
like the one person on hacker news pointed out

488
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,800
the amount of time and money spent

489
00:20:58,089 --> 00:21:01,760
having this fire drill with this thing before N PM reverted the change and fixed it.

490
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,770
If all that money was collected up and paid to this guy,

491
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,040
he probably could have retired,

492
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,760
right?

493
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:10,520
You know,

494
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,819
I make the same argument in my log for J thing where it's like

495
00:21:12,829 --> 00:21:16,449
by enabling this thing by default and forcing people to turn it off,

496
00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:17,859
to make it safe, that

497
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,739
effort to not break backwards compatibility ended up costing

498
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:25,410
Lord knows how many millions of people hours and,

499
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,329
and dollars to, to deal with this thing when it finally blew up

500
00:21:29,949 --> 00:21:31,550
and how many more features have been enabled by

501
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,099
default that are going to have the same outcome

502
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,660
like, well, all of them.

503
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:37,180
Yep. I think part of it is

504
00:21:37,459 --> 00:21:40,640
this speaks to companies like Red Hat with their business model of.

505
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,089
We will take a bunch of open source and make it.

506
00:21:43,609 --> 00:21:45,900
I don't want to use the word safe but make it more palatable.

507
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:50,339
But I don't know that that's gonna work in ecosystems like N PM where it's just

508
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:54,369
uh there's literally millions of packages.

509
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,670
I don't think it's the right way to think about this anymore.

510
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,449
Anyway, I think that was the attitude you needed

511
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,810
back in the day

512
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,939
because

513
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,890
you had things like Sun versus

514
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,000
Linux. And so

515
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:12,569
would say look at us, we're the, the big friendly company, we're safe.

516
00:22:12,579 --> 00:22:15,969
You can come here and you don't have to worry about that scary open source over.

517
00:22:15,979 --> 00:22:17,689
I mean, even something as simple as

518
00:22:18,489 --> 00:22:23,020
I go through a company. So that when the for example, the faker dot js github

519
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:25,750
repo is still wiped like he basically as far as I can tell,

520
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,069
deleted the repo and then recreated it from scratch with one commit.

521
00:22:29,439 --> 00:22:33,579
So all the commit history, all the issues, everything is gone.

522
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,500
You. Right.

523
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:35,189
And

524
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,229
there's like a million forks of it. Cool.

525
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:41,579
And I, you know, linked to one in the global security database entry.

526
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,160
But,

527
00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:46,680
you know, you got to figure out which fork do you want to use as a trustworthy, blah,

528
00:22:46,689 --> 00:22:47,329
blah, blah, blah, blah.

529
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:47,790
Right.

530
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:48,849
Sure.

531
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,930
And so

532
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,390
I,

533
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,589
I can't help but feel like maybe what we need to do

534
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:57,099
is just encourage people to add a layer of caching because honestly,

535
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,670
data storage is not super expensive anymore.

536
00:22:59,680 --> 00:22:59,869
It's

537
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,829
caching wouldn't have mattered in this instance.

538
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:02,089
-- No,
-- no, no,

539
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:04,020
but caching would because I'd still have a copy

540
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,810
of the old one that before it got wiped.

541
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:08,449
But the old ones are still there. They're all on N PM.

542
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:11,079
Well, yeah, because N PM did a good job,

543
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:11,790
right?

544
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:16,400
But the problem is N PM had to roll it back because everybody specifies used latest

545
00:23:16,849 --> 00:23:20,420
and so N PM had to take the action of removing version 6.6 0.6

546
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:24,170
and flipping it back to version 1.4 0.2 or something.

547
00:23:24,729 --> 00:23:28,550
-- But I think that
-- in this case, N PM did the right thing for free and that's all

548
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,239
and kudos to them.

549
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,189
But what I'm saying is a company that does that as like

550
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:35,689
a matter of habit and maybe provides like a proxy interface.

551
00:23:35,699 --> 00:23:36,439
So that kind of

552
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:38,670
you have all of this for sure. Not just

553
00:23:38,869 --> 00:23:42,439
hopefully N PM does the right thing. Hopefully github does the right thing.

554
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,500
-- I
-- mean, I don't find that a cash would have mattered here.

555
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,380
I think here's, here's the problem is.

556
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,819
So let's say you have a system in place where you have a cash

557
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:53,439
and you have some sort of approval system.

558
00:23:53,449 --> 00:23:57,010
-- So the new version of faker comes out, I, I don't
-- care, even if it's approved,

559
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:00,760
-- I just want to have copies of the old
-- data but the copies of the old data already exist.

560
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,380
Kurt, they're all on N PM.

561
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,650
They do. Those weren't deleted. What got deleted was github. Right?

562
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,500
But what happens next time if this is something outside of N PM

563
00:24:08,869 --> 00:24:11,689
-- with an ecosystem that isn't as responsible?
-- I mean,

564
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:15,719
OK, but how, how are you going to cash it? Like, what are you gonna do?

565
00:24:15,989 --> 00:24:16,530
Well, like,

566
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,609
like J frog and artifacts and all those things, do it just

567
00:24:19,979 --> 00:24:21,969
when you download it, keep a copy of it.

568
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:23,130
Well, no, and I agree.

569
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,339
I think that's valuable,

570
00:24:24,349 --> 00:24:26,560
but I'm just pointing out like in this particular instance,

571
00:24:26,569 --> 00:24:28,489
what you're suggesting is irrelevant.

572
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:32,560
Well, the problem is that these, these programs assume,

573
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:35,469
ah, you know what it is, the, the, not the programs,

574
00:24:35,479 --> 00:24:38,599
the language is basically assume that nothing will sort of

575
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:42,400
ever go malicious or disappear or otherwise kind of go wonky

576
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:46,280
and hang on a sec. Speaking of which there's a tweet that I uh

577
00:24:46,829 --> 00:24:49,719
that's kind of relevant to this. It's from here we go, here we go.

578
00:24:49,729 --> 00:24:52,189
From Daniel Stenberg. You know, you might have heard of him.

579
00:24:52,489 --> 00:24:53,069
Um,

580
00:24:53,589 --> 00:24:53,900
the Pike

581
00:24:54,089 --> 00:24:55,270
World website has gone AWOL

582
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,239
straight up

583
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,670
Pior dot IO is, is gone.

584
00:24:58,099 --> 00:25:00,060
Yeah. Well, no, it's back now.

585
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,599
Yeah, it came back.

586
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:06,560
I don't, I don't know if anyone said why it, it disappeared and came back.

587
00:25:06,569 --> 00:25:07,800
It might have been, uh,

588
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,520
it might have been related to this.

589
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:13,390
-- It might have been something completely unrelated. We don't know
-- it's back.

590
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,510
But uh but that's the point is like, are we going to learn anything from this?

591
00:25:16,569 --> 00:25:17,380
Probably not.

592
00:25:18,609 --> 00:25:22,069
This is the kind of thing where, you know, well, I'll pick on CV,

593
00:25:22,709 --> 00:25:24,829
CV E has a database with URL S

594
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,579
and this is before they removed all the dead stuff. Like

595
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,550
all of sun.com, half the links are still broken

596
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:32,130
a lot.

597
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:33,130
Yeah.

598
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:35,760
And some of that's like, and some of them and worse,

599
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,449
I know half the links are broken

600
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:39,609
and I know at least a big chunk of the,

601
00:25:39,619 --> 00:25:42,189
the links that quote unquote do work actually go

602
00:25:42,199 --> 00:25:44,170
to web pages without the information that you want.

603
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,630
So for example, there's one CN A

604
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,839
where all their links go to a marketing web page now

605
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,560
and the data is gone.

606
00:25:51,109 --> 00:25:53,790
-- That's fine. Everything's fine,
-- you know,

607
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,369
and, and so that's what I say with,

608
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,829
with this sort of caching layer of at least you have a

609
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:02,349
copy of the data that was what you supposedly trust and used

610
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,849
and you can sort of start to recover from there.

611
00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:07,260
And it's, it's going to be horrifically difficult and painful.

612
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,939
Like these people are showing all these things like, oh,

613
00:26:08,949 --> 00:26:12,150
if you edit this dot whatever file you can like, overwrite the,

614
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,290
the color dot Js name and like redirect it to this

615
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,260
other directory with a copy of the thing where it works,

616
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,000
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

617
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:19,770
And it's like, oh my God, this is, this is horrible,

618
00:26:20,209 --> 00:26:22,910
like asking, you know, tens of thousands of people to do that.

619
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,199
No, the correct answer is N PM did the right thing and just boof, we magicked.

620
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,000
It works again.

621
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,979
That's definitely the right way to

622
00:26:29,449 --> 00:26:30,640
good job N PM.

623
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:34,540
But like I said, there's ecosystems where stuff is not as mature and not as

624
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,000
like this happened over a weekend.

625
00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:39,459
-- It always happens on the weekend, man. You
-- know what?

626
00:26:39,469 --> 00:26:42,479
Yeah, actually it has, there's been a lot of Bad Fridays recently.

627
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,150
It's just the way it is.

628
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:46,599
Yeah, I don't know what the solution is but I,

629
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:52,750
no, I got the solution. It's, it's, it's peeing on things like it's the comic.

630
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:55,839
I, I legitimately, I've been thinking about this all day

631
00:26:56,609 --> 00:26:57,239
and

632
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,119
I not peeing. Um

633
00:27:00,609 --> 00:27:01,589
Anyway,

634
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,219
yes.

635
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,079
So,

636
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,150
-- II I truly believe though we're
-- professionals. Folks don't try this at home.

637
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,790
That's right.

638
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,219
If you're getting advice from us, I'm so sorry.

639
00:27:12,329 --> 00:27:15,050
-- Where did it all go wrong? You know what
-- the worst thing is? Our advice probably is.

640
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,030
-- Statistically better than most.
-- I'm,

641
00:27:17,199 --> 00:27:20,939
you're probably right anyway. But, but in all seriousness, I think

642
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:27,050
it is incorrect to think of open source as a collection of problems and solutions.

643
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,119
And

644
00:27:28,709 --> 00:27:30,729
-- just to
-- use the label open source,

645
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:31,349
like,

646
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:35,400
I'm sorry, have you? Like, for example, there's Linus

647
00:27:35,689 --> 00:27:35,800
Torvalds

648
00:27:36,229 --> 00:27:38,079
and then there's the open BS D people

649
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,969
and they're both open source. But

650
00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:40,890
like,

651
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:43,890
you know, like a sea slug

652
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:46,310
and a blue whale are both animals

653
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:50,349
and, and that's another problem. But I think fundamentally

654
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:52,079
this is where

655
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:57,609
you have to decide what open source means to you. And it could be a case of, I am an

656
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,849
un unwitting consumer of this

657
00:28:00,209 --> 00:28:03,339
and I'm along for the ride and what happens, happens and that's the way to,

658
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:04,839
there's nothing wrong with that.

659
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:09,800
There are legitimate reasons to just say I'm going to run latest,

660
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:13,880
I'm going to stay up to date and I know things will break and that's ok.

661
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:14,800
That's life.

662
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,560
Well, but that also supposes that these people have some control over it.

663
00:28:18,569 --> 00:28:19,060
You know, there's, I,

664
00:28:19,069 --> 00:28:22,579
I know a lot of people running a product or service that they kind of have to use or,

665
00:28:22,589 --> 00:28:25,660
or even legislated to use and it's, you know, it's terrible.

666
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:26,459
I mean,

667
00:28:26,589 --> 00:28:28,839
but that's, that's a, that's a different kind of problem. Right?

668
00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:31,020
When you're, when you're being told you have to do something

669
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:34,150
that's not an experience anymore. Right.

670
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,359
Well, it's an experience in the sense that jail is an experience.

671
00:28:36,369 --> 00:28:38,739
-- It's like you're gonna go through this and you're going to do this this time.
-- I don't,

672
00:28:39,209 --> 00:28:40,859
you know, that's not what we're talking about.

673
00:28:40,869 --> 00:28:43,170
Well, no, no, no, but I'm saying it's, yeah. No, you're right.

674
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:44,810
It's where you're,

675
00:28:44,939 --> 00:28:46,060
it's fundamentally different.

676
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:46,180
A

677
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:46,359
man,

678
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:52,369
you have the ability to make decisions and choices and no choice is a choice.

679
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,079
And I think sometimes we forget that and in the context of,

680
00:28:55,089 --> 00:28:56,780
of the open source universe.

681
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:57,089
And

682
00:28:57,579 --> 00:29:00,680
I mean, this is the freaking open source security podcast for crying out loud.

683
00:29:00,689 --> 00:29:01,520
You know, it's time,

684
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:03,040
it's about time we earned. It

685
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:03,900
is

686
00:29:04,069 --> 00:29:08,479
like this is, this is the reality, it is up to you

687
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:11,709
to decide what your open source experience is going to be.

688
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:13,920
And I think to date for the vast majority of us,

689
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:18,199
our open source experience has been that of an unwitting passenger

690
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,229
on a bus careening down the hill.

691
00:29:22,209 --> 00:29:23,780
You know, it's funny, on a related note,

692
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,650
I've been watching a lot of videos on um

693
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:28,140
backup power supplies for houses and tying in,

694
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:30,660
you know, the, the cutover switches and automated ones and so on.

695
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,359
And I've decided consciously not to do it because

696
00:29:33,369 --> 00:29:35,390
the number of power outages here are is,

697
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,170
it's in the single digits per year and like one

698
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:41,459
every time it happens, you're like, man, I wish I had that backup.

699
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,430
Um

700
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:45,290
But I also realized no, I have laptops and a cell phone.

701
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:47,270
So it's actually not that bad but,

702
00:29:47,469 --> 00:29:49,510
but looking at it, you know,

703
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,780
yeah, people generally choose the default when it comes to electricity.

704
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,750
That is, they pay their provider and they get electricity most of the time.

705
00:29:56,219 --> 00:29:56,609
And yeah,

706
00:29:56,619 --> 00:29:59,010
unless you spend multiple thousands of dollars to

707
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,640
buy a power generator and a bunch of,

708
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:02,650
you know, fancy wiring and automated,

709
00:30:02,829 --> 00:30:04,969
automated cutover switches and blah, blah, blah, blah.

710
00:30:04,979 --> 00:30:09,280
I looked at it one time and you're basically anything under 20 grand

711
00:30:09,619 --> 00:30:11,030
you're going to have problems with

712
00:30:11,329 --> 00:30:13,469
like it is a crazy investment.

713
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:15,920
Basically anything under five grand and you might as well

714
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,770
just buy a generator and plug your fridge into it.

715
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,449
-- I mean,
-- and that is an option.

716
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:20,880
Like there's no

717
00:30:20,984 --> 00:30:22,275
nothing wrong with that

718
00:30:22,594 --> 00:30:24,474
-- unless you're not at home when it happens.
-- I mean, that

719
00:30:24,755 --> 00:30:25,244
that is,

720
00:30:25,675 --> 00:30:26,285
yes,

721
00:30:27,474 --> 00:30:28,405
-- it is.
-- It is.

722
00:30:28,614 --> 00:30:31,385
But, but the point is it's, it's, that's fine in the, you know,

723
00:30:31,395 --> 00:30:34,765
the power generating world is generally quite mature and,

724
00:30:34,775 --> 00:30:36,875
and places that have problems with power

725
00:30:36,885 --> 00:30:38,405
generally know they have problems with power

726
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:41,234
and maybe that's the problem here is a lot of people using open source,

727
00:30:41,244 --> 00:30:43,364
don't realize that there are any problems because it has

728
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,724
worked so well and so efficient for so long.

729
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:50,219
But quite literally like how often does, what happened this weekend, ha

730
00:30:50,369 --> 00:30:52,359
or this week or whatever happened? Well,

731
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:56,930
-- this year, the last six months,
-- it's, it's like again,

732
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:59,890
it's in the single digits across an ecosystem of

733
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,280
-- tens of millions of packages and developers
-- and,

734
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:05,079
and in all seriousness, I would not be shocked

735
00:31:05,229 --> 00:31:09,239
if, for the rest of the year, nothing much happens and if

736
00:31:09,709 --> 00:31:13,410
nothing drastic changes because everyone's like e it's good enough, you know,

737
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,209
-- even
-- simpler.

738
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,030
I will bet a reasonably large sum of money but more closed

739
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,160
source companies will go bankrupt and

740
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:23,109
their software will stop being supported entirely

741
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:27,770
than, you know, open source developers who decide to delete their repos

742
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,449
and, and do shenanigans.

743
00:31:29,949 --> 00:31:30,449
I mean,

744
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:33,280
that's not even a bet. That's just,

745
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,719
that's reality like that.

746
00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:38,939
That feels like when people predict the future and

747
00:31:38,949 --> 00:31:41,869
their prediction is just like literally following the trend line

748
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,010
-- to where it's going, you know.
-- Yes, it's like I predict it will be

749
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:46,550
actually,

750
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,969
it's a bad prediction because it's actually not supposed to be that cold tomorrow.

751
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,359
But yeah,

752
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:49,869
I predict

753
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,140
it will still be winter tomorrow,

754
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,420
not even in the middle of January. I think it's a safe bet.

755
00:31:55,430 --> 00:32:00,449
And, and so anyway, OK, we're, we're at and out of time here and I, I feel like we've,

756
00:32:00,459 --> 00:32:02,369
we've gone off into some silly places.

757
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:07,489
But I think fundamentally at the end of the day, we, we have 22 choices,

758
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,930
we either get to be a

759
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,689
passenger

760
00:32:10,869 --> 00:32:12,099
on this great open

761
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:13,250
source experiment

762
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:14,369
or

763
00:32:14,689 --> 00:32:18,719
we get to start making our own choices and, and we get to

764
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:23,699
decide what our open source experience is going to be and like to date,

765
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:25,020
we're mostly passengers,

766
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:27,560
maybe you'll stay that way. There's nothing wrong with that.

767
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:30,000
But if you don't want to keep being a passenger,

768
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:33,020
like the solution isn't to complain about open source or

769
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:35,250
to yell at M PM or to yell at github,

770
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,160
the solution is to figure it out and, and make it your own.

771
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,579
I would say even better than that.

772
00:32:40,589 --> 00:32:40,939
There,

773
00:32:40,949 --> 00:32:43,459
there's options that will hopefully involve sort

774
00:32:43,469 --> 00:32:45,420
of next generation open source companies.

775
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,640
What Red hat did for Linux 20 years ago,

776
00:32:47,709 --> 00:32:50,099
hopefully somebody looks at kind of what's going on

777
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:52,400
and does something a bit, you know,

778
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:55,040
so like there's various cloud companies that

779
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,880
are sort of strip mining open source currently

780
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,890
and, you know, very popular with it,

781
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:02,040
but hopefully, maybe there's some next generation companies

782
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,630
that do some

783
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:07,969
really cool things that also add to the sustainability of the ecosystem.

784
00:33:07,979 --> 00:33:09,579
And I think that's a big part of it, right? Is that

785
00:33:09,689 --> 00:33:13,680
it, it is, is that ecosystem sustainability and,

786
00:33:13,689 --> 00:33:16,449
and here's the best part about that ecosystem sustainability is

787
00:33:16,589 --> 00:33:20,400
most of these open source software authors will keep doing it no matter what.

788
00:33:20,969 --> 00:33:21,459
So

789
00:33:21,949 --> 00:33:26,520
we don't actually need, you know, billions of dollars to fund this and keep it going.

790
00:33:26,729 --> 00:33:29,229
Um Which is fascinating because I don't know if you read that FTC

791
00:33:29,239 --> 00:33:32,910
statement where they basically said the FTC is aware that this sort of reliance

792
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,630
on open source that's not funded is a problem and we're going to

793
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,680
do something about it and it's not clear what they're going to do.

794
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:40,030
I assume it involves congressional hearings and

795
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,469
stern words. But the point is

796
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:43,780
this

797
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:47,380
system already works amazingly well,

798
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:52,089
with no care and feeding realistically from major companies.

799
00:33:52,439 --> 00:33:56,630
Well, and look, I mean, this is probably a topic for a whole another show but the, the,

800
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,189
the government will say

801
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:02,270
getting involved and I'll put that in quotes, scares the bejesus out of me

802
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:05,040
because they don't understand what's going on.

803
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:09,550
There's, there's literally no way you can fix a system. You don't understand.

804
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:12,228
Part of the problem is there's millions of different things going on

805
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,030
and

806
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,978
you know, like even just looking at N PM versus

807
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,300
well, C pan is still around and kicking, which kind of blows my mind.

808
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:23,270
C pan will never die. No. Pearl, sadly will never die.

809
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,770
I wish it kind of would like no offense. I loved Pearl. I used Pearl, but it is time

810
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:30,978
to move on. Like I don't speak Latin. That's ok.

811
00:34:31,228 --> 00:34:34,770
-- I bet a frightening amount of infrastructure still runs on top of
-- Pearl.

812
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:35,708
This is true. Yeah.

813
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:36,659
No, you're right.

814
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,580
We need to call this one man.

815
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:40,570
I,

816
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:43,978
we should definitely talk about government intervention

817
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:45,250
and open source at some point.

818
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:48,208
Don't, you cannot use the term government intervention because we just,

819
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,489
-- I believe your country just finished one of those and it did not end
-- well.

820
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:56,810
Anyway. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone. For listening. Go to open source

821
