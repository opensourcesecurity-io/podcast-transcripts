Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 160 with myself,

1
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:12,600
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:15,689
So I always love these two part episode things we do

3
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:19,489
because we just finished the other episode like minutes ago.

4
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:21,959
And I have no idea how long it's been in real

5
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:24,129
life because I might publish them at the same time,

6
00:00:24,139 --> 00:00:25,389
I might publish them.

7
00:00:25,629 --> 00:00:28,930
I don't know, a week apart, we'll see like only time will tell.

8
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:33,150
So, hello, listener from some point in the past, I guess.

9
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:34,412
But anyway, right. Cool.

10
00:00:34,423 --> 00:00:37,603
So disclosure is our topic and we kind of talked about,

11
00:00:37,612 --> 00:00:39,722
we had a bit of a grab bag in the last episode.

12
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:41,783
We talked about a whole bunch of crazy disclosure,

13
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:45,073
ideas and concepts and we really wanted to focus on open source this

14
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:48,443
time and I'm going to frame this in the context of Web men,

15
00:00:48,493 --> 00:00:51,243
which has a wild story

16
00:00:51,393 --> 00:00:52,673
around it at the,

17
00:00:52,682 --> 00:00:57,522
at this time that is still developing and I'm sure isn't near complete

18
00:00:57,772 --> 00:00:58,443
and

19
00:00:58,603 --> 00:00:59,483
is amazing.

20
00:00:59,783 --> 00:01:02,483
-- So
-- honestly, I'm kind of shocked that Web Men is still a thing.

21
00:01:02,805 --> 00:01:05,615
Nothing ever dies. Kurt you should know. So web

22
00:01:05,755 --> 00:01:08,475
is that web-based admin panel thing for your server, right?

23
00:01:08,486 --> 00:01:11,475
Where you can like set up virtual host format, the hard drive,

24
00:01:11,486 --> 00:01:14,456
fiddle with your email and it's basically you can,

25
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:15,055
that's

26
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:16,515
management, whatever.

27
00:01:19,365 --> 00:01:23,515
So anyway, there was a talk at defcon

28
00:01:23,676 --> 00:01:24,316
in

29
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:25,015
the

30
00:01:25,305 --> 00:01:27,916
AEC village. I believe it was if I'm remembering correctly

31
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:30,996
where a researcher discovered a backdoor in Wedman

32
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,290
-- and he talked about it.
-- OK? Like an intentional backdoor,

33
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,800
an intentional backdoor, bad person added a backdoor, right? And

34
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,669
he didn't tell the web men people that he found it.

35
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,220
I

36
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:47,139
found out after his talk about this. And

37
00:01:47,589 --> 00:01:50,150
if I was disclosing an issue,

38
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,959
-- I
-- would say there's actually a difference between

39
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,790
a security vulnerability and an intentional backdoor.

40
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,279
No, the web and people didn't put it there.

41
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:01,620
-- Kurt, somebody hacked them, added a back door and this guy found
-- it.

42
00:02:01,669 --> 00:02:03,480
Like, how long was it in there for

43
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:03,629
a

44
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:05,860
couple of versions? And in fact,

45
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:06,940
they,

46
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:12,240
it didn't, it wasn't on by default, you had to set a setting. And then I guess, uh

47
00:02:12,649 --> 00:02:16,149
they try due to a series of bizarre events, they, they,

48
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,119
somebody submitted a pull request,

49
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:21,050
maybe the same guy to like basically enable this

50
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:23,020
setting by default and it broke too much stuff.

51
00:02:23,029 --> 00:02:23,710
So they undid it.

52
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,610
So there was a small window where all of

53
00:02:25,619 --> 00:02:28,229
the web men instances were vulnerable to this.

54
00:02:28,339 --> 00:02:28,910
But

55
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,350
the ignoring all of that,

56
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,419
if you are a researcher

57
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:38,149
and you show up at a conference with, with a talk like this and you've never,

58
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,789
you haven't told the open source project what's going on.

59
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:44,929
-- Don't do that.
-- Well, especially like I'm just looking at web men's thing.

60
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,250
They have a security page with security alerts,

61
00:02:47,429 --> 00:02:48,309
lots of

62
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:49,520
them.

63
00:02:50,059 --> 00:02:53,490
But the point is they, they do fix security flaws and I,

64
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,889
I don't know how they are about it but I assume they're not complete jerks.

65
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,580
-- You know,
-- my understanding is they are acceptable.

66
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:03,039
I don't, I wouldn't say they're amazing. I wouldn't say they're bad.

67
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:04,320
I would say they are,

68
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:09,869
they're good at what they do. Exactly. And that's a huge part of this is,

69
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,070
this is where framing open source differently

70
00:03:13,339 --> 00:03:15,619
is enormously important because

71
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,279
as a researcher,

72
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:21,399
-- you're talking to a guy who might,
-- I would say it's complicated

73
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:24,080
because there's open source like Red Hat where like

74
00:03:24,089 --> 00:03:26,130
you and I literally were paid to deal with.

75
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:29,639
-- Well, these people,
-- no matter what open source, I would,

76
00:03:29,649 --> 00:03:32,529
I would put that in the vendor bucket when I say open source,

77
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:34,679
I'm talking about a project.

78
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,610
Oh, ok. Ok. You're talking about the, the upstream, right? Got it

79
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,220
-- upstream. Exactly. Exactly.
-- Ok.

80
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:43,740
What about an upstream, like openshift that's owned by Red Hat

81
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,080
vendor. That's clearly a vendor, right? There's,

82
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,369
and that one, that one's too easy. I mean, we could

83
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:50,529
open SSL.

84
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:55,139
It gets a little more dicey because Open SSL is a foundation and is that a vendor,

85
00:03:55,149 --> 00:03:55,899
is it not a vendor?

86
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,389
I don't know what's going on anymore.

87
00:03:57,929 --> 00:03:58,529
And

88
00:03:58,809 --> 00:04:00,309
that one's more complicated.

89
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,240
But even them, I would,

90
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,675
I would dump in the vendor bucket and not think twice about it just because it,

91
00:04:04,684 --> 00:04:08,115
it makes life easier and like they have a dedicated security team

92
00:04:08,294 --> 00:04:10,264
and they're competent and they know what they're doing.

93
00:04:10,285 --> 00:04:10,574
I mean,

94
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:13,815
one of the challenges you get is if you're a researcher and you go to

95
00:04:13,824 --> 00:04:17,875
say an open source project that may have never released a security update before.

96
00:04:17,885 --> 00:04:20,394
In fact, this just happened to me about a year ago where

97
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,220
I went to a project and I basically said,

98
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,910
look like we found the security issue in your stuff and they said,

99
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,730
I don't know what that means. Right.

100
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,070
And, and then I looked at their website, they never released a security update.

101
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,660
Well, not intentionally,

102
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,010
but they know we fixed security flaws they don't know about.

103
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:34,459
But,

104
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:35,279
yeah.

105
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:38,220
Ok. That's fair. I will agree with that 100%.

106
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,570
And so, like, they didn't know what to do.

107
00:04:40,869 --> 00:04:43,329
Well, see. And this is what drives me is fundamentally what do you do?

108
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:45,390
Well, fix the code and ship an update

109
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,299
and, and maybe ideally label it as a security update.

110
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,070
-- Yeah. But
-- that's easy for us to do.

111
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:52,290
I mean, and in our case, like I got him a CV ID,

112
00:04:52,299 --> 00:04:53,929
like we did it upright just because they were,

113
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,529
but at the same time it was one of those situations where

114
00:04:56,679 --> 00:05:00,350
it's like if you have a heart attack in front of the doctor's house. Right. Oh, good.

115
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:03,190
You're fine. But, you know, that doesn't usually happen.

116
00:05:03,325 --> 00:05:04,795
So it's, it's obviously

117
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:06,345
dier for a lot of people. Yeah.

118
00:05:06,355 --> 00:05:10,304
And I mean, if you're a researcher and you go to an open source project and say, hey,

119
00:05:10,315 --> 00:05:13,734
I found the security issue and they come back and say, I don't know what that is.

120
00:05:14,144 --> 00:05:16,864
-- What do you do now?
-- Honestly, I would say

121
00:05:17,174 --> 00:05:20,825
I would have, I would try to help them understand the vulnerability or the flaw,

122
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:24,584
you know, and, but more in the context of a classic vulnerability

123
00:05:24,785 --> 00:05:27,825
or flaw, not like a security vulnerability or security flaw

124
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:31,880
and get them to fix it hopefully properly and ship an update

125
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,230
and ideally label that update as a security update so that people know

126
00:05:35,619 --> 00:05:36,089
that, you know,

127
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,429
this update maybe matters more than those other updates and ideally get a CV for it.

128
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,109
But, you know, honestly,

129
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:45,410
the main thing is get the code fixed and get it out there.

130
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,790
I, I agree with you,

131
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:50,600
but I would not be shocked at all if researchers who say don't have free

132
00:05:50,609 --> 00:05:53,329
time and maybe this is something they do for fun in the side or whatever,

133
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:54,959
they might send that mail, they get back.

134
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:55,940
I don't know what this is

135
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,880
and they may never reply again.

136
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,660
-- You
-- know, these people are doing this for free. Then that's kind of a best effort.

137
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,519
And my one comment there is you could, for example,

138
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:06,239
then as a security researcher choose to just

139
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,179
simply publish it to the full disclosure list,

140
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:11,679
kind of not the nicest thing to do. But I disagree.

141
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:13,720
Well, no, no, no, no, no, I didn't say it's not the right thing to do.

142
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,640
I said it's not the nicest thing to do

143
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,359
that's different.

144
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:19,500
And for example, you could, you could send it to Cert

145
00:06:19,619 --> 00:06:23,179
-- and have them deal with it. Cert
-- doesn't care. Cert's already too busy.

146
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,149
In fact, I'll never forget I had, I called CT once.

147
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,359
This was years and years and years ago where there was,

148
00:06:28,579 --> 00:06:31,359
we, we, I, I was in the middle of an incident and

149
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:31,839
in fact,

150
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,760
I was at Red Hat at the time and I just started working with them and like we needed,

151
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,040
we needed ct's help to make some contacts

152
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:40,600
and I called him and this was like, on a Saturday morning, I think it was.

153
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:41,920
And they're like, we, we're not gonna help you.

154
00:06:41,929 --> 00:06:43,920
We don't, we, we're not gonna do anything

155
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:44,839
and they hung up

156
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,920
and it was like, what now, what just happened?

157
00:06:46,929 --> 00:06:49,040
I'm surprised they actually answered the phone on a Saturday.

158
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:53,790
Yeah, I found a number but I don't know if I was supposed to, but like, they didn't care

159
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:56,880
and I think that's the problem is, Cert is

160
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,989
-- grossly overwhelmed.
-- Well, no, no, no, no.

161
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,570
See, you are just making the attribution again.

162
00:07:03,579 --> 00:07:05,829
You say they don't care, they may not have understood.

163
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:08,480
Didn't you just finish saying that when you try to report a security flaw?

164
00:07:08,489 --> 00:07:11,790
Maybe, you know, except that the remote end might not caught on to it as fast.

165
00:07:12,049 --> 00:07:14,029
-- You'd like
-- this one was pretty obvious, Kurt,

166
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:17,429
like they knew, they knew what was going on and they,

167
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,079
they legitimately said we don't care like this was, this was very cut and dry, right?

168
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:26,929
This wasn't a oh I can overwrite one null byte of memory in

169
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,399
this obscure location that's in the middle of a data structure like it.

170
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:34,119
I think it's exploitable. Like no, no, this was like,

171
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:34,559
yeah,

172
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,920
there's a guy holding a gun to my head and he's going to shoot me if you don't help.

173
00:07:37,929 --> 00:07:39,769
Oh, you don't care. Thank what? By

174
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,970
that. That's what we were talking about here, right? This was,

175
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:46,320
it was very obvious. Yeah, but anyways

176
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:51,500
isn't going to care and I think publishing it to the world is not

177
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,070
irresponsible necessarily because at least somebody who

178
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:56,170
might care can do something about it.

179
00:07:56,179 --> 00:07:56,450
Then

180
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,260
now I will also say as a caveat to this github

181
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:03,140
is starting to do security advisories for projects on github.

182
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:05,179
And basically at this point, everyone's on github.

183
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,570
I think. So I'm comfortable just saying that like

184
00:08:08,049 --> 00:08:11,940
that might be a game changer, but it obviously it's going to take some time.

185
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,260
So we're not there yet.

186
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,179
But at the same time, if you're an open

187
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,179
source project and you're listening to this or you have friends or whatever,

188
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,709
uh, look at the github

189
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,059
security advisories.

190
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:24,359
Well, the other thing to remember too is, I mean, you don't have to make github

191
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,579
your source of truth. You can just clone it into github to take advantage of this.

192
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:28,850
Right.

193
00:08:28,859 --> 00:08:30,480
And that's something I think a lot of people forget

194
00:08:30,489 --> 00:08:32,489
is that you don't have to like move to github,

195
00:08:32,609 --> 00:08:34,080
just make a copy of the stuff in github

196
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:35,719
with all the depths and everything and

197
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,799
-- you'll start getting those notifications.
-- Sure. Right. Right.

198
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,950
Yeah. And that's fair. That's fair. So let's, let's keep going.

199
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,919
We have a situation where a person

200
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,359
may have reported a security issue to an open source project

201
00:08:48,909 --> 00:08:52,419
and let's say they understand it is a problem

202
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,489
and they're willing to fix it.

203
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:55,210
Ok?

204
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,630
What happens next is where things can get dicey as well,

205
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,789
where

206
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:04,510
I've seen open source projects get security reports and they might just fix it

207
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,510
immediately and say nothing like they might just add a commit to their source

208
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:09,859
source co management

209
00:09:11,099 --> 00:09:11,510
people.

210
00:09:11,979 --> 00:09:14,960
Yeah. Right. Right. And they might not release a security advisory.

211
00:09:14,969 --> 00:09:15,890
They might not say anything.

212
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,229
And you might say, hey, why don't you guys release a security advisory?

213
00:09:18,619 --> 00:09:21,349
And they might say we don't care, we don't need one. This is fine.

214
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:26,320
Just everyone runs our current version. It's ok and you're like maybe not. Um

215
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,799
And I think that's one of those instances where again,

216
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:31,880
like publish it to full disclosure or something.

217
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,599
Well, see, here's the problem is you get some really fundamental,

218
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,919
fundamentally different business models and software cultures,

219
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,169
but they have very different realities.

220
00:09:43,369 --> 00:09:45,859
And one thing I wanted to mention is, well, so like, where do we,

221
00:09:45,869 --> 00:09:47,140
where do we put the line of?

222
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,700
So you release a piece of software, how responsible are you for it

223
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,609
once you release it? Because,

224
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,219
you know,

225
00:09:53,229 --> 00:09:55,049
I literally know people who've released a piece of

226
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:57,020
software that they kind of scratch their own itch

227
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,049
and it ended up getting like 10 million downloads

228
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:01,169
because it apparently was a really good scratcher.

229
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,090
Well, are they all of a sudden beholden to these 10 million people to keep them safe?

230
00:10:05,099 --> 00:10:09,119
You know, because I'm pretty sure every software license ever says, you know,

231
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:13,229
we disclaim any and all everything to do with anything going wrong.

232
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:17,539
-- So
-- actually, I have a great story for you about that. The, the, the guys who did zip

233
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:18,530
the

234
00:10:18,969 --> 00:10:19,030
Vor

235
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:20,559
and

236
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,700
the other, I forget they've got the VP A is VP eight there. I forget.

237
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,650
Anyway, they've got,

238
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:27,919
they have all these audio and video formats they created, right?

239
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:30,679
And uh Chris Montgomery is the guy who

240
00:10:30,969 --> 00:10:33,409
is kind of the brains behind it all.

241
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:37,679
And I remember working with him at one point where there was a security issue in like,

242
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:38,250
so in Ag

243
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,849
Vor library he was publishing

244
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,679
and his comment was, oh well, this is just like, you know,

245
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,159
this is proof of concept code.

246
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,260
No one should be running this in production.

247
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,119
And I remember

248
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:51,659
Chris the freaking world like this code is in everything today.

249
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:54,919
Like this is probably one of the most U I it's in

250
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:57,640
the top 20 of most used pieces of code on the planet.

251
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,150
Like no, this is not a proof of concept.

252
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,590
We have to fix this and,

253
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,539
and that happens sometimes.

254
00:11:04,549 --> 00:11:05,919
And now at the same time,

255
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:08,729
I think the popularity of a project is something

256
00:11:08,739 --> 00:11:10,820
to take into account because let's face it.

257
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:16,059
If you are fixing an issue that is in 20% of everything ever built on the planet.

258
00:11:16,469 --> 00:11:19,770
I think it is a very different universe than if

259
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,359
it's a project that let's say has 25 installs.

260
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,320
-- I
-- could flip it on its head and say, you know,

261
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,739
if you're doing something for free that 20% of the planet uses,

262
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,289
shouldn't that 20% of the planet

263
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,039
maybe be kicking back some resources to help you,

264
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,710
right? I mean, because that's the problem we have in

265
00:11:33,929 --> 00:11:36,400
like in the CV world, for example, you know,

266
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:39,989
there's a lot of, you know, when I shut down the DW, I remember everybody's like, oh,

267
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:43,140
I would have helped and it's like, no, no, I know you wouldn't have helped.

268
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,809
And I have the proof that you wouldn't have helped because you didn't help.

269
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:47,409
And I asked

270
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:49,349
people and I obviously, I, you know,

271
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:51,849
I didn't have a big marketing campaign to ask for help.

272
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,130
So I would say fundamentally if you are kind enough

273
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,770
to write some software and give it away for free.

274
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,909
Awesome. Thank you.

275
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,669
That's all you have to do now,

276
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:01,340
if you want to do more and especially if you

277
00:12:01,349 --> 00:12:03,539
want to do security and do it really nicely.

278
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,849
Awesome. Thank you. That's amazing.

279
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:09,010
But fundamentally if you don't, I I'm not going to be angry at you.

280
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:12,330
Uh So here's where I would turn this on, on its head and I agree with you.

281
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:16,969
I think just like just publishing source code for the world to use is an enormous

282
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:21,469
benefit to society. And that's, that's all you owe. You don't even know what's that.

283
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:25,489
But thank you. Here's why I want to turn it on its head though is, let's say

284
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:27,080
you have a, in order,

285
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,309
I'll pick on Red Hat because we have that know them from experience.

286
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,090
So let's say

287
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:34,729
Red Hat shipping your stuff and you have a security issue in your stuff.

288
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,419
There's no shame in saying redhead, I need help

289
00:12:37,849 --> 00:12:41,500
or in fact, and if, if, if someone is shipping your stuff and you say, hey,

290
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,429
I've got a security issue here I could use some help with and they say, no,

291
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,859
screw those guys.

292
00:12:45,869 --> 00:12:49,179
-- That's not. Ok.
-- Well, and it's the classic free rider problem.

293
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:53,690
And to me when I say free rider problem, I need it in the sense of like how to identify

294
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:56,619
the situation not to pass judgment on it.

295
00:12:56,789 --> 00:13:00,510
Because fundamentally one of the fundamental pieces of open source is that,

296
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,030
yeah, you can take well depending on the license,

297
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:05,190
but you can take my open source and go make a

298
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,229
pile of money with it and give me nothing in return.

299
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:09,489
Not even a bug report

300
00:13:09,599 --> 00:13:10,590
or a thank you.

301
00:13:10,869 --> 00:13:12,549
And quite fundamentally,

302
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,559
is it moral or ethical? Don't know.

303
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:19,979
But that's what the license typically allows and even encourages in many cases.

304
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:20,700
Right. Right.

305
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,820
Now, should these morally and ethically, should they kick back or help?

306
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:24,510
Yeah, probably.

307
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,640
Especially if they, you know,

308
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,880
don't want to get surprised the next time there's a security

309
00:13:28,155 --> 00:13:28,765
and it's like,

310
00:13:28,994 --> 00:13:30,794
-- why didn't you tell us? And
-- that's exactly it.

311
00:13:30,804 --> 00:13:34,335
That's exactly the right way to look at this is, I mean, when we were at Red Hat,

312
00:13:34,344 --> 00:13:37,585
if a project came to us and said we need help like we were on it.

313
00:13:37,594 --> 00:13:37,934
Right.

314
00:13:37,945 --> 00:13:39,534
That was, that was part of the job, was,

315
00:13:39,544 --> 00:13:42,534
was kind of that community help in that respect.

316
00:13:42,544 --> 00:13:42,885
And

317
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:44,179
I mean, even today, look,

318
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,219
if you're a project listening and you need help and you email me,

319
00:13:47,229 --> 00:13:48,010
I'm going to help you.

320
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,739
I don't care if I've never heard of your project before.

321
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,250
I don't care if I don't even know what the language is like,

322
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,950
you will get help because it's just, it's one of those, like, morally,

323
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,599
right things to do for society because this is,

324
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,070
and even just from a utility point of view, like,

325
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,799
if you and I help will take five minutes and we'll save them five hours.

326
00:14:04,809 --> 00:14:08,059
Well, right, because we also have done this for 20 years.

327
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:11,059
That, that's another part of the, the

328
00:14:12,104 --> 00:14:13,114
here, I guess too. Right.

329
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,645
Is, is if you're a new project,

330
00:14:14,655 --> 00:14:16,815
if you're a new researcher and you've never done this before,

331
00:14:16,864 --> 00:14:18,854
it's the used car salesman thing, man.

332
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:22,005
Right. When you go to buy a car, that guy, you think you're going to finagle him?

333
00:14:22,015 --> 00:14:25,434
No, he, he, like he or she does this like three times a day,

334
00:14:25,445 --> 00:14:27,934
-- you do it once every three years
-- right before

335
00:14:27,945 --> 00:14:29,804
you've stepped all the way through the door,

336
00:14:29,864 --> 00:14:31,294
they know what's going on.

337
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:36,974
Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Right. Exactly. Right. And anyway, uh, so, right.

338
00:14:37,155 --> 00:14:39,815
So you're a researcher, you report something

339
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:40,614
and

340
00:14:40,969 --> 00:14:42,320
it, it, it can be a challenge.

341
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:47,559
Now, at the same time, I will say there is nothing wrong with

342
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:49,669
not, not doing this all in secret.

343
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:54,190
And this is a trap I think we fell into as an industry a long time ago. And we were,

344
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:59,159
I, I will blame myself as being obscenely guilty of this in the past of where

345
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:01,510
every security issue needs to be secret.

346
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,630
-- Like we, we have to keep a secret, we can't talk about it
-- and by security,

347
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,619
you mean embargoed.

348
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:10,150
-- Yeah,
-- embargoed would be the term that was used in for, you know, in our space.

349
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,739
And we talked about this stuff and I will tell you now,

350
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:16,390
an embargoed security issue is insanely expensive.

351
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,469
And I don't mean that in terms of money, I mean,

352
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,289
it's mentally exhausting.

353
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:25,929
You generally need special setups internally to run your tests and test, you know,

354
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,929
do you check in your code, all this kind of stuff?

355
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,250
And it is an

356
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:32,950
enormous amount of work and sometimes that's ok. Right.

357
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,809
-- You look at some of these, well,
-- sometimes it's needed.

358
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,169
Right.

359
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:40,520
-- For a really bad security issue. It's ok,
-- but very rarely. Right.

360
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,049
Exactly.

361
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:45,359
And I think in 99.9% of the time you don't need to have an embargo issue

362
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:48,500
and just dumping this stuff in a public issue on github

363
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,479
-- is the right way to do it
-- well, and in fairness, github

364
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,640
has made this easier now. So kudos to them.

365
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:54,080
Yes.

366
00:15:54,229 --> 00:15:54,909
Yes, they have,

367
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:57,250
you can at least have private issues and stuff because there are

368
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,460
some really good arguments for the embargo thing which is like,

369
00:15:59,469 --> 00:15:59,979
for example,

370
00:15:59,989 --> 00:16:01,080
you don't end up with press about it

371
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,169
and then people harassing you constantly because that's,

372
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:03,809
that's the thing.

373
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,520
Like, I remember some security issues in certain pieces of software

374
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:08,679
would get the press going and

375
00:16:08,979 --> 00:16:10,880
then you have to deal with that.

376
00:16:11,099 --> 00:16:11,559
And I mean,

377
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,599
there's been cases where these poor open source projects have gotten really grumpy

378
00:16:14,609 --> 00:16:17,719
because it's like we got bad press about X because of this.

379
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:21,119
You know, why couldn't you report this privately or whatever? Right.

380
00:16:21,219 --> 00:16:24,070
-- Right.
-- You called my baby ugly. Basically.

381
00:16:24,849 --> 00:16:27,039
Sometimes it's just an ugly baby Kurt.

382
00:16:27,739 --> 00:16:30,070
But please don't, please don't send me hopefully they

383
00:16:30,309 --> 00:16:30,349
just

384
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:30,940
want

385
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,260
sure that's it. Uh,

386
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,539
but anyway, anyway,

387
00:16:35,549 --> 00:16:38,299
this is one of those situations where I think when

388
00:16:38,309 --> 00:16:41,299
I would say if you're a researcher contacting a vendor,

389
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:44,979
you kind of hold all the cards and you can make them dance for their dinner.

390
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,500
I think if you're a researcher and you're working with a small open source project,

391
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,705
like you need to cut these guys a little bit of slack

392
00:16:50,715 --> 00:16:52,765
and this is totally the right way to look at it.

393
00:16:52,775 --> 00:16:53,044
And,

394
00:16:53,195 --> 00:16:55,815
and additionally, if you don't want to work with a little project,

395
00:16:55,825 --> 00:16:57,255
find a vendor shipping their stuff,

396
00:16:57,265 --> 00:16:59,375
like go to a Red Hat or somebody and report to

397
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,445
them because I know when we were at Red Hat,

398
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:03,085
if you wanted to report an issue,

399
00:17:03,344 --> 00:17:04,505
Debian and ubuntu,

400
00:17:05,723 --> 00:17:07,925
-- basically everything,
-- go to one of those guys and,

401
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:12,084
and talk to them and interact with them and that can sometimes work, work very,

402
00:17:12,094 --> 00:17:12,765
very well.

403
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,510
So, you know, at the same time, I want to say,

404
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:20,040
let's say you're an open source project and somebody comes to you with a

405
00:17:20,229 --> 00:17:21,319
security issue.

406
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,979
What, what do you do? Right?

407
00:17:22,989 --> 00:17:28,380
-- What now,
-- I mean, uh depending on your maturity model basically, I would say try to,

408
00:17:28,689 --> 00:17:33,500
you know, fix it, ship it and again, label it as a security issue so that

409
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,979
the people know it's kind of a special one,

410
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:40,089
ideally maybe get a CV E identifier as well because that

411
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:42,349
makes it easier to identify and talk about.

412
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:44,670
But also gets it into the CV database, which, you know,

413
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,479
again is a great notification tool because to put it bluntly, you know,

414
00:17:48,489 --> 00:17:50,849
unless you're paying for a vulnerability feed

415
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,719
CV is kind of the only free vulnerability feed out there.

416
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:57,324
It, it is true. Now, let's, let's back this all the way up.

417
00:17:57,405 --> 00:18:01,564
If someone sends you a security report, it's a bug at the very least, right?

418
00:18:01,574 --> 00:18:02,885
How would you fix any bug?

419
00:18:02,895 --> 00:18:05,635
You're just going to do a release, you might have a change log entry.

420
00:18:05,645 --> 00:18:08,015
I don't know, it depends on the project, how you're going to deal with it.

421
00:18:08,025 --> 00:18:11,045
So I would say at the absolute minimum, if someone sends you something

422
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,150
patch it,

423
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:18,050
-- right. Get a, get a patch shoved in your repo
-- well, or at least document it.

424
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:18,640
In some cases,

425
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:22,300
security flaws are really hard to fix because of architectural design choices,

426
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,250
at least documented the behavior and let people know about it.

427
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:25,869
Right? Because

428
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:28,810
then I can make at least some decision as to what

429
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:29,780
to do with this and,

430
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,329
and that decision could be to stop using

431
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:33,890
the software because it's just broken and unfixable

432
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,849
or I could change the behavior or I could use it in a safe way.

433
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:37,170
I mean,

434
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:37,890
you know, there,

435
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,689
there was a lot of cases at Red Hat where there

436
00:18:39,699 --> 00:18:41,150
was a flaw in some software and it was like,

437
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,459
ok, well, we don't use it in that way, haa,

438
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,170
you know, we'll, we'll eventually patch it and ship an update for it, but

439
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:48,359
we're not vulnerable in, you know,

440
00:18:48,369 --> 00:18:51,119
and we use it in a very constrained manner in this product, for example.

441
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:51,869
-- So we're,
-- we're good.

442
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,680
So that's actually becoming a lot harder now

443
00:18:54,689 --> 00:18:57,359
because of all these automated security scanners,

444
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:00,800
I get scan reports on a regular basis now where people will say

445
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:05,329
uh here's the 7000 CV I DS. My scanner says you're vulnerable to

446
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:11,319
and I will say uh 6995 of these are

447
00:19:11,329 --> 00:19:15,170
false positives and these five don't affect us because

448
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,209
we're not using that functionality in that library. And they say

449
00:19:18,459 --> 00:19:20,969
we don't care, the scan has to come back, clean, fix it.

450
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,410
And then it's like, I don't think,

451
00:19:23,755 --> 00:19:28,265
-- you know what you just asked?
-- Well, and the thing is that's not really

452
00:19:28,464 --> 00:19:28,474
a

453
00:19:28,574 --> 00:19:31,594
problem for open source projects because, well,

454
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:34,265
you're not paying me so good luck with that scan report.

455
00:19:34,275 --> 00:19:35,594
Exactly. Exactly.

456
00:19:35,604 --> 00:19:38,604
If you're an open source project and someone ever send you a scan report like that,

457
00:19:38,614 --> 00:19:42,204
like just send them back a picture of someone holding up the middle finger and that,

458
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:43,704
that there's a nice picture of Linus.

459
00:19:43,714 --> 00:19:45,824
Right. That's exactly the right thing to do there

460
00:19:46,175 --> 00:19:46,875
because they owe,

461
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:49,944
you owe them nothing you've already given them more than they deserve.

462
00:19:49,954 --> 00:19:50,824
And so that's,

463
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,250
that's really important to always remember

464
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:54,180
now

465
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,829
at the same time.

466
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:58,310
Uh Yeah, if you're, if you're a consumer of this stuff, like, don't,

467
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:00,060
don't be asking projects for that, that's,

468
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:02,949
you're in a hole if you do that. Right. Like go help.

469
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:06,270
These people don't ask them for help. Right. So,

470
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:12,189
this is a bizarre mishmash of advice and problems again

471
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,140
because this is super hard to do and especially in open source.

472
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,750
I think it's even dicier

473
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:22,729
-- than it's ever been before without question.
-- Well, it also matters more. I mean,

474
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:26,849
it used to be computer software around on a computer, did something but now

475
00:20:27,189 --> 00:20:31,550
I have computer software in my house that controls a bunch of light bulbs, you know,

476
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:34,829
-- a ring doorbell, but
-- not only that, it's all open source.

477
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:35,439
Yeah.

478
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:41,010
But at the more extreme end, like, there's Tesla, like that vehicle.

479
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:42,650
If somebody hacked it and made it drive,

480
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,655
like they can make it drive into a crowd of people.

481
00:20:44,665 --> 00:20:47,545
Security bugs are, you know, you can blow up generators.

482
00:20:47,555 --> 00:20:47,935
Like every,

483
00:20:47,944 --> 00:20:49,814
every piece of industrial equipment is now attached

484
00:20:49,824 --> 00:20:51,074
to the internet and you can probably,

485
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:53,574
most of them, you know, run it in some way.

486
00:20:53,714 --> 00:20:56,334
Well, and again, it, it's, it's all open source.

487
00:20:56,344 --> 00:20:59,454
I mean, that's the, that's the most important thing to think of here is,

488
00:20:59,704 --> 00:21:00,854
and, and again,

489
00:21:01,064 --> 00:21:02,474
this is where

490
00:21:02,584 --> 00:21:08,405
I feel like if you're an open source project and you don't have the ability to handle,

491
00:21:08,425 --> 00:21:10,214
dealing with security

492
00:21:10,564 --> 00:21:11,375
reports.

493
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,229
Right.

494
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:12,930
Essentially,

495
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:15,430
if you lack the ability to kind of disclose

496
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:18,069
things to the public about what's going on,

497
00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:20,589
you need to ask for help

498
00:21:20,689 --> 00:21:23,189
and the people who are running your stuff

499
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:27,430
can either help or they can get screwed over because you're

500
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:30,229
not doing what they think you should do for them.

501
00:21:30,719 --> 00:21:32,750
And there's no shame in that either.

502
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,140
And I think that is such an important point is

503
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:40,430
these so many organizations are treating open source as this,

504
00:21:40,439 --> 00:21:42,560
just set it and forget it, thing.

505
00:21:42,739 --> 00:21:44,050
Well, they're strip mining it. Right.

506
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,329
-- And they,
-- right, they, they take whatever they want and they never update it.

507
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,290
And this is actually a place where these automated scanners.

508
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,030
Well, I know that a lot of them are terrible right now.

509
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:56,020
I think this is where we're going to end up where these

510
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:58,869
automated scanners are going to be able to look at what you have

511
00:21:59,155 --> 00:21:59,925
and say

512
00:22:00,025 --> 00:22:04,885
you have software from 12 years ago and it has these 7000 security issues in it.

513
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:06,025
You need to fix it.

514
00:22:06,104 --> 00:22:07,885
Well, the thing I keep telling a lot of devs is,

515
00:22:07,895 --> 00:22:10,765
is it's not so much about fixing the security flaws, but it's,

516
00:22:10,984 --> 00:22:13,084
if you can't keep the software up to date,

517
00:22:13,135 --> 00:22:15,515
then essentially you're diverging from reality,

518
00:22:15,525 --> 00:22:17,704
you're diverging from what everybody else has,

519
00:22:17,885 --> 00:22:19,895
which means at some point when you do have to fix it. Well,

520
00:22:20,155 --> 00:22:21,285
good luck with that.

521
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:23,349
It's probably not even going to work, you know,

522
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:28,969
and it also speaks to just your general ability to ship an update or fix

523
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:32,510
your software because again, if you can't do that, you can't do that.

524
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,650
Now, for whatever reason, be it a bug or a security flaw versus,

525
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:39,510
you know, if you keep up to date on security updates, that kind of forces you to,

526
00:22:40,199 --> 00:22:43,000
to have better process, you know, C I and CD,

527
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,939
you know, I've seen a lot of organizations that don't have C inc D.

528
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:48,859
So shipping a, you know, a software release is a major

529
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,869
Multiweek or even multi

530
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,859
month marathon in some cases and it's, you know, not easily reproducible

531
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,390
again, not talking about a security reproducibility thing.

532
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:57,630
I mean,

533
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,819
actually just talking in the sense of like we shipped an update and it didn't blow up,

534
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,260
you know.

535
00:23:03,469 --> 00:23:05,500
No, I know, I know exactly what you mean.

536
00:23:05,939 --> 00:23:06,560
And

537
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:07,310
so I,

538
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:10,300
I guess the thing I keep coming back to in my mind as

539
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:13,760
we talk about this in the context of open source is very much.

540
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:15,359
If you're a project,

541
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,239
you owe us nothing.

542
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,040
You've already given more than you,

543
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:24,469
you need to because the amount you need to give is zero and you've surpassed that.

544
00:23:25,349 --> 00:23:27,329
Now, I think you could, there,

545
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:31,069
there will be people who will make the argument that it is morally wrong

546
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:34,170
to release software to the world and then never take care of it.

547
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,030
And

548
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,209
if you believe that just don't use open source, which

549
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:38,930
you can't

550
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,199
is kind of where that

551
00:23:40,729 --> 00:23:40,750
is,

552
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,760
-- but I feel like
-- never buy anything ever again.

553
00:23:44,229 --> 00:23:46,140
That's right. Seriously.

554
00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:46,339
I,

555
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:51,010
I think the, the place we're going to have to end up with all of this is

556
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:56,670
if you are an organization consuming or repackaging open source,

557
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,869
which is basically every organization at this point.

558
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,959
I think the last holdout might have been Microsoft and

559
00:24:00,969 --> 00:24:02,650
they gave up on this a long time ago.

560
00:24:02,829 --> 00:24:05,500
They didn't give up, they embraced the heck out of it.

561
00:24:05,939 --> 00:24:07,250
It's nice actually because

562
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:12,209
I, I have a, I kind of hate to say this but I have a slightly better Linux experience

563
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:16,569
on Windows 10 now than I do actually on native Linux.

564
00:24:17,619 --> 00:24:19,869
Oh, my goodness. We wanna talk about that.

565
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,479
But here's the thing

566
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,760
with all of this put together

567
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,640
with a pretty bow on top

568
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,510
is

569
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:32,329
the organizations, the vendors making money off of the open source.

570
00:24:32,459 --> 00:24:34,079
It is up to them

571
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,500
to somehow

572
00:24:35,729 --> 00:24:39,859
make sure these problems are dealt with and there's a multitude of

573
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:42,579
-- ways
-- or to make the choice of not dealing with it.

574
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:45,030
No, that's not, that's not gonna be an option.

575
00:24:45,229 --> 00:24:47,449
I think the, the automated scanners

576
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,119
-- are going to fix that
-- the light bulbs I bought.

577
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,219
I know they're running out of date software and

578
00:24:52,229 --> 00:24:54,560
will never be updated properly and have security flaws.

579
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:56,849
Like, for example, if you end map, scan the base unit,

580
00:24:56,859 --> 00:24:59,119
it dies like you have to hard power it.

581
00:24:59,239 --> 00:25:02,800
That's a, that's a feature. See you can't, you can't hack it if it crashes.

582
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,410
Right.

583
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,260
And, but I, I went in knowing this,

584
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:09,270
that like there is no good light bulbs available that will

585
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,109
get software updates for at least say five or 10 years,

586
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:13,410
like the lifetime of the light bulb.

587
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:17,140
And so I made a choice to buy basically the cheapest, most garbage ones because.

588
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,000
Right. Right.

589
00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:18,849
Same thing.

590
00:25:18,859 --> 00:25:19,089
And,

591
00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:22,609
and we've talked about this at length in the past is like

592
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:27,050
crappy and working is going to defeat secure and working every time.

593
00:25:27,489 --> 00:25:31,790
I mean, unquestionably. But however I'm talking about, I'm a company

594
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,430
shipping software

595
00:25:33,729 --> 00:25:35,349
that's full of open source.

596
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:36,410
And

597
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,920
what I'm seeing now is customers

598
00:25:40,089 --> 00:25:43,209
are starting to scan this software using tools.

599
00:25:43,219 --> 00:25:45,930
Like, I mean, we talked to aqua security not long ago. Right.

600
00:25:45,939 --> 00:25:47,510
Or, or SNCC is another one.

601
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,219
-- Well,
-- yeah, in that case,

602
00:25:48,229 --> 00:25:50,689
if you want to keep those customers and not make them angry then, yeah,

603
00:25:50,699 --> 00:25:53,369
you better start fixing this stuff and keeping, well, not fixing it,

604
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,589
keeping it up to date.

605
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:58,630
Yes. I mean, just, just blindly updating it would suffice.

606
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:00,770
But I, I have a feeling

607
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:05,219
right. I mean, that's right now, but I have a suspicion in the future.

608
00:26:05,229 --> 00:26:06,400
Blindly updating.

609
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:08,989
Won't be enough because these,

610
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,599
these scanners are gonna get better and better and better

611
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,750
and we're gonna reach a point where

612
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:18,880
the actual security of the stuff you're including is going to matter. And that means

613
00:26:19,089 --> 00:26:20,500
if you want to use it

614
00:26:20,989 --> 00:26:24,880
now, we're going to have to start caring more. And like today,

615
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,369
you basically have three options.

616
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,530
Option one is, I don't care, I'm not doing anything,

617
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,250
which is basically what most people do.

618
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,989
Option two is getting involved with the upstream and in some cases

619
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,359
you'll see that in a lot you won't because if you're shipping,

620
00:26:37,369 --> 00:26:40,109
let's say 500 open source libraries in your product,

621
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:41,319
you're not going to get involved.

622
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:41,780
Well,

623
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:44,500
Mercedes remember that I looked at their list of all

624
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,979
the open source in a Mercedes car and it's over 1000

625
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:50,959
-- projects.
-- Yeah. Right. Exactly. You're not gonna get involved in all 1000 right?

626
00:26:50,969 --> 00:26:54,930
Maybe some, maybe the most important ones you could conceivably get involved in.

627
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,150
And the third

628
00:26:56,329 --> 00:26:57,750
I think is going to be

629
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:00,510
I I envision a sort of universe

630
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:04,729
where there are kind of like companies helping Shepard around the open source.

631
00:27:04,739 --> 00:27:07,349
And like today, Red Hat is an example of that.

632
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:07,569
I mean,

633
00:27:07,579 --> 00:27:09,599
the way they work is diverging from kind

634
00:27:09,609 --> 00:27:12,250
of the the rest of mainstream development now,

635
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:12,530
but

636
00:27:12,989 --> 00:27:16,699
it went back when Red Hat was founded like that, that was mainstream open source,

637
00:27:16,709 --> 00:27:17,530
unquestionably, right?

638
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,650
Like they were the only game in town for the most part,

639
00:27:20,109 --> 00:27:22,770
I see there's companies like Tide Lift, for example,

640
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:27,329
that have the ability to kind of sponsor open source. I see some of the efforts

641
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:29,439
SNCC are doing where they're getting heavily

642
00:27:29,449 --> 00:27:31,369
involved in some of these security issues

643
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,969
and they're really shepherding them along and

644
00:27:32,979 --> 00:27:34,369
they're doing research to find new ones.

645
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,689
Like that's really cool.

646
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,410
And I think that is

647
00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:43,219
unquestionably where all of disclosure is going to end up at some point, but I don't

648
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,050
and it's probably 20 years away.

649
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,650
Well, I think part of it is the industrialization of it,

650
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:48,180
right?

651
00:27:48,189 --> 00:27:52,650
It's that centralization, that economy of scale, that specialization, you know,

652
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,579
the fact is like when you have a security team with

653
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:57,089
like five full time people that just do this and really

654
00:27:57,456 --> 00:27:58,215
CV and stuff,

655
00:27:58,495 --> 00:28:01,495
you know, they can churn through a lot of vulnerability

656
00:28:01,865 --> 00:28:02,145
really

657
00:28:02,296 --> 00:28:03,745
fast and, you know,

658
00:28:03,755 --> 00:28:05,546
you can handle a lot of

659
00:28:05,556 --> 00:28:08,566
vulnerabilities and upstream notifications and assisting them

660
00:28:09,066 --> 00:28:09,965
with a pretty small team.

661
00:28:09,975 --> 00:28:12,755
But basically, but they have to basically be, that's all they do.

662
00:28:12,946 --> 00:28:14,326
-- Yep,
-- that's fair.

663
00:28:14,336 --> 00:28:18,235
In fact, that's funny because I just II I released an advisory today and I,

664
00:28:18,362 --> 00:28:21,942
I only do this a couple times a month now, only a couple of times a month and it,

665
00:28:21,952 --> 00:28:23,381
it takes a while to remember.

666
00:28:23,391 --> 00:28:25,802
Well, it's not like it used to be, I mean, you know,

667
00:28:25,812 --> 00:28:30,271
that elastic currently doesn't have, we do pretty good while I'll say.

668
00:28:31,082 --> 00:28:31,852
And so I don't,

669
00:28:31,862 --> 00:28:35,241
I don't release a ton of advisories and every time I do it now I've got to, you know,

670
00:28:35,251 --> 00:28:37,141
pull up my process document and,

671
00:28:37,151 --> 00:28:39,102
and check it out and make sure I'm doing things right.

672
00:28:39,112 --> 00:28:39,421
And

673
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:42,790
it's funny because I remember when I did this, you know, twice a day, every day.

674
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,890
It's like, I don't, I don't even need to look at the process document, you know, II,

675
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,560
I am the process document.

676
00:28:47,569 --> 00:28:48,750
It's fine.

677
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:50,550
So it's just, it's different,

678
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,270
it's different and I get this and if you do it once or twice a year, it's even harder,

679
00:28:54,439 --> 00:28:54,930
you know.

680
00:28:55,089 --> 00:28:55,650
So,

681
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:58,310
all right. So we are approaching the end

682
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,750
and I guess let's

683
00:28:59,979 --> 00:29:03,030
I, I will give my parting thought and I will let you give the last note.

684
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,390
So here's my parting thought,

685
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:08,270
ask for help. There are a lot of people who can help you.

686
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,849
I will help you. Kurt will help you.

687
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:15,270
-- You can probably just say on Twitter, hey, I need help with this
-- in fairness.

688
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,619
Kurt's pretty busy. So Kurt may point you at somebody else to help.

689
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:22,359
-- I'm just saying like, well, no, and
-- that's just it, right?

690
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:24,989
Like I'm, I'm not going to help anyone and hold their hand.

691
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,680
I'm going to say here's what you need to read, here's what you need to look at, right?

692
00:29:27,689 --> 00:29:29,520
And that, that's what, that's what I mean by help.

693
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:33,719
-- We're gonna do the work
-- because I've had people try and fob off their, their job on me,

694
00:29:33,729 --> 00:29:36,400
like vendors who are like, I want you to help me

695
00:29:36,739 --> 00:29:40,030
and, yeah, don't do that. And I, I will not do your job for you.

696
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,839
And if you're a vendor, like,

697
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:47,069
I'm not working for you for free either. So I don't think that's an invitation.

698
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:49,060
That's the thing. Right. Just, just ask for help.

699
00:29:49,069 --> 00:29:51,430
There's a lot of good security people out there

700
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,709
that can help you out

701
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:53,670
and

702
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,790
find them

703
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,030
and work with them.

704
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:56,910
And

705
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:00,270
I, I guess at the same time, like that also comes in into line with there,

706
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,030
there's a lot of talking heads if you ask someone for help and they don't help you.

707
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:03,989
I would be my,

708
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,680
be wary of their advice because it's quite likely they actually

709
00:30:06,689 --> 00:30:08,510
don't know what they're doing and they just like they're,

710
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,920
they're a gas bag.

711
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:10,829
But anyway. All right.

712
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:16,869
-- So Kurt, your turn and
-- try to be a little bit kinder and more understanding

713
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:18,189
to each other,

714
00:30:18,979 --> 00:30:20,900
you know, especially in the open source world.

715
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:21,170
Like I,

716
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:25,119
there's literally projects running on all the computers where it's one

717
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:27,489
person who works on it part time on the weekend.

718
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,030
Yep. Yep. That's true.

719
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:30,530
You know,

720
00:30:30,709 --> 00:30:32,089
thanks to people like those,

721
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:34,550
not everybody gets to actually work for a vendor that

722
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,930
pays them to work on the thing full time.

723
00:30:37,239 --> 00:30:39,770
And that, that's fair. Be nice. Be nice to open source.

724
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:42,689
And I guess if you're open source, uh, try to be nice

725
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,609
to the people you have to work with also.

726
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:47,010
But let's all just be everyone. Be nice to each other. Right?

727
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,010
That seems like good advice.

728
00:30:48,339 --> 00:30:51,630
Yeah. All right, sweet. So, I guess thank you, Kurt. Thank you for listening.
