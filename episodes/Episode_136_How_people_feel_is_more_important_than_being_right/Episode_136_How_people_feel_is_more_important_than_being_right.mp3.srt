Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 136 with myself,

1
00:00:10,829 --> 00:00:13,420
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:14,029 --> 00:00:18,649
So I uninstalled almost every app for my phone over the weekend.

3
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:20,860
Yeah, I

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,329
actually, yes, that was not the reason,

5
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:25,750
but it's,

6
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:30,010
my battery is rocking it right now. No, I realized that

7
00:00:30,389 --> 00:00:31,069
I,

8
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,069
I, I'll be doing nothing and I'll just, like, whip up the phone and start, you know,

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,939
doing, looking at Twitter or looking at Reddit or, or whatever.

10
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:40,430
And I'm like, I'm just like killing time or, or I'll,

11
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:42,979
I'll have 10 seconds where I don't have anything to

12
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,610
do and I pull my phone out instead of,

13
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:46,189
you know, being like a functional human.

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,549
And I thought I'm, I'm tired of this and

15
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:51,349
this will tie nicely into our, our conversation later.

16
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:55,229
But it was basically one of those things of, I, I think

17
00:00:55,869 --> 00:00:58,330
I can still get to everything that I took off.

18
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,900
I, I put a bunch of websites back in the browser and whatnot,

19
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:03,090
but I've made it slightly difficult for myself.

20
00:01:03,099 --> 00:01:04,919
And so I've given myself a perception of

21
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,050
difficulty and now I've drastically altered my behavior,

22
00:01:08,059 --> 00:01:09,330
which pleases me immensely.

23
00:01:09,849 --> 00:01:10,029
Yep.

24
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,010
No, I'm the same way. I don't keep really much alcohol in the house because

25
00:01:13,809 --> 00:01:17,040
I honestly can't be bothered to drive two minutes to a liquor store to get a beer.

26
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,989
Right. So, like, I'm pretty sure I'm not an alcoholic.

27
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,190
-- Right.
-- But you know, if it's in the house, why not?

28
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,970
No, I hear you, man. Like junk food. I'm terrible with that too.

29
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,290
It's like, oh, look, there's Doritos, I better eat those.

30
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,370
But if there's no Doritos, I'm not like, man,

31
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:32,370
I really could use some Doritos right now.

32
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,849
No, I hear you.

33
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:39,110
It's, it's funny how humans are so easily swayed in one direction or the other.

34
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:41,059
Well, I mean, I think that's the beauty of all this,

35
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:43,010
these attempts at online delivery services.

36
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:43,620
You know, where,

37
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:44,699
uh, what is it

38
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:48,040
dial for dine or whatever will now deliver mcdonald's and

39
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,860
like Tim Hortons to your house and I'm like,

40
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,980
who gets mcdonald's delivered to their house?

41
00:01:53,589 --> 00:01:57,989
I have never done that. I, I know we have multiple de delivery services here.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,699
There's like Uber Eats and Grubhub.

43
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:00,150
I

44
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:00,529
know that

45
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:01,610
all the more

46
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,930
and it's, it's one of those things where, yeah,

47
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,300
it's mcdonald's and stuff and I keep thinking, I,

48
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,929
man, if I need food delivered, it's not going to be mcdonald's.

49
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,529
But on the other side of that,

50
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,339
there are some very nice local restaurants on the list.

51
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,710
And so in those instances I think it's awesome.

52
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,059
Yeah, I know because github

53
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,229
has been in the news again.

54
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,139
Well, it just, it cracks me up because they, they have this appeasement strategy.

55
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,500
-- That's ridiculous and totally works. All right.
-- Well, first explain the story

56
00:02:28,779 --> 00:02:32,250
-- that we're discussing. So this
-- time it's a thing called deep fakes.

57
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:34,779
And the idea is very simple. You take a neural network,

58
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,169
you feed it a bunch of pictures of somebody like say Steve

59
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,210
Buscemi or whatever.

60
00:02:39,339 --> 00:02:42,039
And it basically creates a model of his face and then

61
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,169
you can insert that over top of somebody else's face in,

62
00:02:45,179 --> 00:02:46,850
say a video or a photograph.

63
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,970
So you can basically, I, I could take your face and put it on top of,

64
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:53,449
you know, some politician giving a speech

65
00:02:53,779 --> 00:02:56,369
or you could introduce, you know,

66
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,570
famous historical figures into modern events or vice versa,

67
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:00,009
right?

68
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,210
And it's also been used for pornography,

69
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,169
which is where it gets most of its attention.

70
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,000
Yeah.

71
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:05,529
So yeah,

72
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:08,300
people have created celebrity pornography by taking just

73
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:11,059
regular pornography and swapping in a celebrity's head.

74
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,380
-- So,
-- so we also say this is, this is open source so anybody can grab this code

75
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,970
-- and do it. Yeah, it's,
-- it's been around for, oh jeez.

76
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:21,029
I don't even know how many years now I have to check the first commit. But

77
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:22,089
um so github

78
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,220
has,

79
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,860
I guess the word hidden is technically correct.

80
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:32,020
No, they didn't hide it. They just added a silly restriction onto

81
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,220
-- going to
-- the, well, the web

82
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:35,199
interface, web

83
00:03:35,369 --> 00:03:36,880
only the web interface. Yes.

84
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,440
So, so basically you have to be

85
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:40,800
a lo like a github

86
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:44,550
user. You have to log in with the github account and then you can go to the deep fakes

87
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,080
github

88
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:50,029
page. And if you're not logged in it basically pops up a hey, you have to log in page

89
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:54,869
and here's the best part though, is cloning the URL.

90
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,479
Yeah, you don't need to log in to do that

91
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,990
you can on. So it's like this is madness.

92
00:04:00,339 --> 00:04:03,190
Well, and I've, I've been through this myself where

93
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:08,029
I had a repo that contained email addresses where people, you know,

94
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,279
agreed to an agreement, put their email address and it was very clear like

95
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:15,029
it said, your email address will end up in this repo for this reason,

96
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,108
it will be public.

97
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,119
Somebody made a GDPR takedown request.

98
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,239
And I'm like, well, I can't really comply with that because of how git works, right?

99
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:22,929
Unless I

100
00:04:23,369 --> 00:04:25,480
delete the repo rewind.

101
00:04:25,489 --> 00:04:28,799
Two years of transactions, take that one transaction out and replay them.

102
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,989
Your email address is in there.

103
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,839
Um But all that was needed was to actually just remove their email address,

104
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:38,200
like to, to delete it out of the file basically.

105
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,980
So even though it's in the get

106
00:04:40,369 --> 00:04:43,279
log and the get, you know, commits back in the day,

107
00:04:43,929 --> 00:04:45,109
they're ok with that because

108
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:49,940
what it seems to really boil down to in all cases is does this show up in Google or not?

109
00:04:50,619 --> 00:04:53,450
That seems to be the problem, not that it's there, but,

110
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,510
but does it show up in Google results?

111
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,380
And I sort of understand that because quite frankly,

112
00:04:58,619 --> 00:05:03,130
ok, Josh, I have this really cool article on something and I could describe it to you

113
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,790
and you're not going to find it in Google.

114
00:05:05,299 --> 00:05:07,890
Does it exist? Is it like, it's like a tree that falls in a forest?

115
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:10,040
But Google doesn't know about it. Does it exist?

116
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:13,799
I think you could easily make the argument of it doesn't

117
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,390
because, I mean, well, look, I run

118
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:21,519
a multitude of blogs and obviously the podcast

119
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:23,279
and various other,

120
00:05:23,609 --> 00:05:26,549
I guess social interaction style sites.

121
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:29,079
And I can tell you now that the amount

122
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:32,820
of traffic that comes from Google is it's significant.

123
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,940
I mean, if, if my stuff

124
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:36,279
traffic,

125
00:05:37,609 --> 00:05:40,480
like the amount of new traffic, like people discovering your site,

126
00:05:40,489 --> 00:05:41,799
if you're not in Google, you're dead.

127
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,299
Uh Yeah.

128
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:43,630
And, and funny enough,

129
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,459
so one of the other things I've come to realize over time is everyone thinks, oh,

130
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,079
you gotta be on Twitter and you gotta be on Facebook and

131
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:52,399
you gotta be on linkedin and this and that and that,

132
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:57,760
and, and the reality is those sites have abysmal click through rates.

133
00:05:57,769 --> 00:06:00,399
I get almost no traffic from those places.

134
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,359
Now, if you hit Reddit or hacker news,

135
00:06:02,369 --> 00:06:06,070
those places are outrageous which the traffic you get from.

136
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,519
Those,

137
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:09,570
I think part of it is people who go to, like Reddit and hacker news,

138
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:13,309
they're looking for new things to, to interest them and to interact with.

139
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:16,589
Whereas Twitter is kind of more of a news feed.

140
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,190
It's something I consume, but I don't go beyond it.

141
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:20,160
Yeah.

142
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,929
And that, that's exactly what I see when I look at my statistics and so, like,

143
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,600
I love Twitter, don't get me wrong.

144
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,679
But even when I think about it, I don't click a lot of links.

145
00:06:32,489 --> 00:06:34,470
That's not even my primary concern.

146
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,640
I feel like I don't want to stop and look, I'm just scrolling through

147
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,559
the, like, you know, mental diarrhea of Twitter

148
00:06:41,929 --> 00:06:43,730
and that's, that's why I'm there. Right.

149
00:06:43,739 --> 00:06:44,600
It's like, it's like,

150
00:06:44,609 --> 00:06:46,929
totally going and sitting at a bar and

151
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,589
just listening to people argue about insane things.

152
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,279
Well, it's like watching the, uh,

153
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,880
not the regular news but the news that they show at the airports.

154
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:58,369
Right. No, no, no. That's exactly what it is.

155
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,209
It's, it's so painful.

156
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,500
Like every time I fly I watch it for about three

157
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,910
or four minutes and then my brain is just like,

158
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,149
nope.

159
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,970
No, you, no,

160
00:07:05,089 --> 00:07:05,730
just, no.

161
00:07:06,609 --> 00:07:07,929
Yeah, that's fair. So,

162
00:07:08,299 --> 00:07:09,700
so anyway, so Github,

163
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,690
let's, let's

164
00:07:12,059 --> 00:07:13,920
-- back from the, the reality
-- is for Github.

165
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,649
Just simply making it. So it doesn't easily show up in a Google result.

166
00:07:18,369 --> 00:07:21,029
That's enough to appease these complainers and

167
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:22,049
they go away

168
00:07:22,329 --> 00:07:23,140
and, and honestly,

169
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:24,399
if I was a business and I could get

170
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,630
rid of somebody complaining by doing something that simple.

171
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,549
-- I absolutely would.
-- I agree with you.

172
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:34,239
And I think that the, the way I want to tie this into security as well is

173
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,470
there's,

174
00:07:35,809 --> 00:07:39,420
there's an attitude in our industry of kind of perfect or nothing where, what Github

175
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,910
is doing isn't perfect.

176
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,589
And so why even bother?

177
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,660
And

178
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,200
it's one of those things that to you or I, we look at this, we're like,

179
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:48,679
this is ridiculous and stupid,

180
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:52,519
but most people look at it and it feels good to them and they think good job github.

181
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,820
You did something.

182
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:57,079
Now there's something that's completely worthless, but it doesn't matter

183
00:07:57,239 --> 00:07:57,279
if

184
00:07:57,869 --> 00:08:01,359
it takes the results out of Google honestly, for most people that's good enough,

185
00:08:01,609 --> 00:08:03,970
it might be, it might be I

186
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,170
-- and like,
-- well to tie this in that,

187
00:08:06,179 --> 00:08:09,040
that mug shot site that posted people's mug shots and

188
00:08:09,049 --> 00:08:11,040
you had to pay a fee to get them taken offline

189
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,290
so that, you know, when somebody Googles your name,

190
00:08:13,299 --> 00:08:14,769
they don't have to put your mug shot

191
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:19,589
and that's actually what's needed because that data, well, I mean,

192
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,809
that's my understanding is the classic case of Florida man.

193
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,329
The reason Florida man is so popular

194
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:28,350
because all of the Florida records are public like from the minute they're entered.

195
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,369
So that's why they get

196
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:34,330
such a bad rap is because just all their stuff is transparent and exposed.

197
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:34,979
Whereas, you know, other

198
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:35,320
states

199
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:35,900
to Florida

200
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:40,590
-- uh
-- No. II, I do know that it's somewhat bonkers.

201
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,729
It's pretty bonkers and I'm,

202
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:45,130
I'm going to agree with you that I think the fact that

203
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,030
the records are public makes it seem worse than it is,

204
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,104
but it's, it's pretty bad.

205
00:08:49,114 --> 00:08:52,085
-- Like Florida is a crazy place.
-- Well, you can see how bad it is.

206
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:52,635
Right.

207
00:08:52,804 --> 00:08:55,414
You know, whereas most states kind of keep it on the down low

208
00:08:55,674 --> 00:08:59,284
and, and let's face it, Any populated state is full of crazy people.

209
00:08:59,294 --> 00:09:02,905
I mean, California is, is in many ways worse than Florida,

210
00:09:02,914 --> 00:09:06,065
which I can't wait for the responses to that, bring it on everybody

211
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:10,094
-- but it, right. It's just one of the miracle.
-- It's just the law of averages. Right.

212
00:09:10,104 --> 00:09:13,744
-- You get 30 some odd million people and right. Right.
-- Statistically speaking.

213
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:14,510
Exactly.

214
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,309
Exactly.

215
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:18,940
So, anyway, anyway, here's, here's what I want to kind of tie this to.

216
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:22,059
So there was a discussion I had some time ago

217
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:24,049
where someone was basically saying we want to do

218
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:26,520
this security thing and actually I'll explain it.

219
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,950
I don't have to give away all the details,

220
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,909
but basically what it came down to was somebody wanted to know when,

221
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,229
when users were changing their password and

222
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,390
they wanted to basically take every line and

223
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,169
at sea shadow and

224
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,250
hash it and then store part of the hash

225
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:43,320
in a database and then you could say, oh, this hash changed.

226
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:46,849
So we know this user changed their password or, or something.

227
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:47,559
Right.

228
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:48,440
-- Something
-- doesn't

229
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:48,619
seem

230
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,969
unreasonable, but I would have just done it through Pam, but whatever

231
00:09:54,099 --> 00:09:56,599
this is. Right. I, I, yes,

232
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:01,239
I agree with that. And that's, that's part of where the conversation ended up.

233
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,070
And here's what I basically said was

234
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:08,130
there's nothing technically wrong with this and it's not unsafe in any way,

235
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,940
but it doesn't, it's not going to feel right to users because now you have a process

236
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,929
reading Etsy shadow

237
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:17,450
over and over again constantly.

238
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:18,049
Right.

239
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:18,890
And so,

240
00:10:19,489 --> 00:10:22,679
well, it has to read it to hash all the entries. Right.

241
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,640
But why can't it just, like, read it when the file changes or a user changes? Right.

242
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:29,849
Yes. Exactly. Right. Read it when it changes.

243
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:31,219
But you know what I mean?

244
00:10:31,229 --> 00:10:34,840
Assuming, but every time you log in it updates a file because it also,

245
00:10:34,849 --> 00:10:35,440
you know what I mean?

246
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,010
There's like,

247
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:39,659
there's a lot of crazy that goes on with this stuff. Ok.

248
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,900
And so

249
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:45,140
it was one of those things where it, it's technically correct, but it feels wrong.

250
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,530
Right. And I think this github

251
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,820
thing is the opposite where it's technically incorrect, but it feels right.

252
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,890
And this is where security.

253
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,700
I think a lot of times we fail to take that, like, ridiculous human element into,

254
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,599
into play.

255
00:10:57,609 --> 00:11:00,659
And, I mean, this is totally like me taking all that crap off my phone.

256
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,380
It's, it's basically all still there,

257
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,690
but I've made it slightly more difficult for myself.

258
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,469
So, I'm, like, ah, screw it. I don't care.

259
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:11,340
Right. Like, this is like, humans are ridiculous bags of meat.

260
00:11:11,349 --> 00:11:12,929
And I think we forget that a lot.

261
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,700
Oh, absolutely. And I, I love actually that the, um, the iphones by default.

262
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,380
Now, if you don't use an app for long enough,

263
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,630
it basically removes the app from your phone,

264
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,049
but it leaves the icon and it leaves like the little cloud with an arrow icon.

265
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:27,010
So, yeah, perfect example, here I've got an app called TV.

266
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,239
I don't even know what this is.

267
00:11:28,349 --> 00:11:29,289
And if I click on it,

268
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:31,909
it's going to say loading and it's going to download

269
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:34,169
it from the app store and then run it.

270
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,690
Uh, whereas if I actually delete it, I'll probably forget

271
00:11:36,969 --> 00:11:40,840
what TV is. I literally, this icon just says TV.

272
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:41,929
Right?

273
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:46,169
Um, delete TV. Yeah, whatever. I don't know what this does. Ok?

274
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:48,489
I probably don't need it and now it's gone and I'll,

275
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,969
unless I go to the App store and actually go hunting for it,

276
00:11:51,229 --> 00:11:52,010
but it's gone.

277
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,049
Interesting.

278
00:11:53,299 --> 00:11:55,109
Well, because I mean, you know, if that's the thing, I,

279
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:56,809
that's one thing I don't like about the App Store is,

280
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,309
is finding stuff that you've previously

281
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,140
installed but forgotten about can be tricky

282
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,950
because their search isn't great.

283
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,679
Um, because, you know,

284
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,570
over the years I've gone through hundreds of apps and deleted a bunch of them, right.

285
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,039
Especially kids games

286
00:12:08,219 --> 00:12:08,739
because you know, the

287
00:12:08,859 --> 00:12:10,090
very family account thing

288
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,809
so,

289
00:12:12,719 --> 00:12:14,200
yeah. No, it's the, I

290
00:12:14,369 --> 00:12:18,840
think what it boils down to is the appearance of security or the appearance of

291
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:23,289
we solve the problem versus actually solving it.

292
00:12:23,729 --> 00:12:24,409
Right. Right.

293
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,729
And most people, the appearance that's, that's good enough

294
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:31,119
because they're not gonna, who digs into these solutions in autism.

295
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:35,090
You know, I, like I said, I had the alternator in my car changed out a few weeks ago.

296
00:12:35,349 --> 00:12:38,849
Uh, my battery was dead and, or was dying and,

297
00:12:38,969 --> 00:12:41,489
you know, it probably wasn't the battery because it was only two years old.

298
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,690
And so went in, took it in. They're like, yeah, your alternator is failing.

299
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,739
Do you want us to replace it? And I'm like, yeah, probably should be done and

300
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,309
they say they replaced it,

301
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:49,859
right?

302
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:50,099
I mean,

303
00:12:50,109 --> 00:12:52,690
am I going to dig through my engine and try and figure out

304
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,530
if that alternator is newer than the one I used to have?

305
00:12:55,539 --> 00:12:56,669
Uh, so my father

306
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:01,219
in law works on cars and he said, always ask for the parts because that way

307
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,979
they, they have to give you the old parts.

308
00:13:03,989 --> 00:13:07,320
They, they don't do that often times here because I did actually, for example,

309
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,380
swap out the rear windshield wiper motor

310
00:13:10,179 --> 00:13:14,090
and they basically, when you buy the rear windshield wiper motor, you pay an extra,

311
00:13:14,099 --> 00:13:16,000
like 80 bucks and you get that 80 bucks back

312
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,580
when you bring the old one back because they want the

313
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,020
casing so that they can put a new motor in it and recondition it because

314
00:13:21,369 --> 00:13:22,679
that casting is,

315
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,750
well, they're not making them anymore.

316
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,440
And you literally put in a new, you know,

317
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:30,479
$2 motor from some Chinese company that makes whatever exactly you need.

318
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:32,989
I'm sure they just go to Aliexpress and buy the one they need.

319
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,520
Pop it in and bam, you've just reconditioned a part.

320
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,539
Nice,

321
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,900
you know, for a few bucks

322
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:41,330
which I totally support because from an environmental point of view, that's great.

323
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,520
-- That's what we want.
-- Yeah. And, and that's fair.

324
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,520
But, I mean, in the instance of if your rear wiper didn't work,

325
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,799
you know, if you got a new one

326
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,270
-- and
-- I would know if my alternator doesn't

327
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,780
work because my car would have stopped starting.

328
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:56,840
Right. I, I had so funny enough, my alternator also went out a couple of weeks ago

329
00:13:57,429 --> 00:13:59,299
and, but my, mine seized up

330
00:13:59,409 --> 00:14:00,599
and it broke my belt.

331
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:01,549
So,

332
00:14:01,669 --> 00:14:04,309
yeah, I got to pay for another belt

333
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,690
because,

334
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,130
and a new alternator

335
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,349
and then I, I, yeah, it was pretty obvious that they replaced it just because, like,

336
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:13,450
the car started so good job guys.

337
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,890
-- Well,
-- but did they replace it with a new one? It looks

338
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,890
very nice.

339
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,590
And I actually know the guy who owns the shop

340
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:23,369
so I'm pretty confident if they're screwing people over.

341
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,969
I'm not on the list.

342
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:27,969
But, you know, that's exactly right.

343
00:14:27,979 --> 00:14:30,960
I don't have enough domain knowledge to look at a car part and say

344
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:34,340
if it's new or used or old or even if that's a problem.

345
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,229
Right. Because

346
00:14:35,369 --> 00:14:37,130
there's a lot of car parts out there that

347
00:14:37,489 --> 00:14:40,960
sure it's 10 years old. That's fine. It's been reconditioned, it's been certified

348
00:14:41,099 --> 00:14:41,780
and that's fine.

349
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:48,010
But again, perception, right, it all comes back to perception and humans,

350
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,640
our perception is our reality.

351
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:50,739
You know what? That's very true.

352
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,359
Our perception is reality because unless we go digging deeper to actually

353
00:14:54,575 --> 00:14:55,405
what's going on,

354
00:14:55,505 --> 00:14:56,445
how would we know?

355
00:14:56,614 --> 00:14:56,945
Right.

356
00:14:56,955 --> 00:15:01,924
And this is what makes security so annoying, I guess is we, we always dig deeper,

357
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:02,484
right?

358
00:15:02,744 --> 00:15:04,554
We totally know what's going on now.

359
00:15:04,565 --> 00:15:05,125
Now,

360
00:15:05,135 --> 00:15:06,854
I'm going to put a big asterisk here and

361
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,765
I hope someone's like throwing their shoe at their,

362
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:09,724
their phone right now

363
00:15:09,974 --> 00:15:11,224
is things like crypto

364
00:15:11,755 --> 00:15:15,565
yet, perception isn't reality in crypto reality is reality in crypto.

365
00:15:15,575 --> 00:15:15,905
Well,

366
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:17,565
I think it goes deeper than that is

367
00:15:17,575 --> 00:15:21,484
most computing systems now are horrendously complex.

368
00:15:21,494 --> 00:15:24,044
Like witness all the specter meltdown vulnerabilities,

369
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,460
you know, that wasn't even, well, it could sort of be corrected in software,

370
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,830
but I wouldn't blame software on this.

371
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,340
That was, you know,

372
00:15:30,349 --> 00:15:34,179
hardware manufacturers doing tricks to make the hardware go a lot faster.

373
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:35,140
Which

374
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,090
honestly, I mean,

375
00:15:36,099 --> 00:15:38,539
when you think about the amount of electrical energy they

376
00:15:38,549 --> 00:15:41,659
probably saved over the last decade alone makes it worthwhile.

377
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,409
But these systems are so complicated. Now, I was reading

378
00:15:45,609 --> 00:15:49,510
the Cloud Flare blog and they were talking about this TCP, socket

379
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,869
reassembly thing.

380
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,909
And the thing is they're benchmarking this stuff and

381
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:56,580
they're getting results that they can't fully explain.

382
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,130
And they're, they even had a,

383
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,760
a chart where they were talking about some

384
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,049
of the behave like the foundational behavior of,

385
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:03,840
you know, socket versus these other things.

386
00:16:04,219 --> 00:16:06,280
And they had, yes. No. And then question marks.

387
00:16:06,289 --> 00:16:09,570
So, so the software has gotten so complex in the Linux kernel.

388
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:12,369
But you can't even say with a high degree of certainty

389
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,820
how something behaves or what it does in some cases.

390
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,840
So I I've not read this blog.

391
00:16:16,849 --> 00:16:22,250
So they're saying that it's, it's faster or slower or what's what's happening.

392
00:16:22,309 --> 00:16:26,380
Well, so here it is. So basically they're talking about this thing called uh sock

393
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,780
map TP splicing

394
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,650
for so for level seven proxies.

395
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:32,919
So they talk about send file versus splice versus VM splice.

396
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,239
Now, they know for sure kind of how they work. Send file. Does this file to a socket?

397
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,580
Right? Reads it in boom fast. OK.

398
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:42,530
Uh It's definitely avoiding a user space memory copy

399
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:47,650
and it's zero copy. It, it is not zero copy. Now, splice is a pipe to a socket.

400
00:16:47,659 --> 00:16:52,979
Cool pipes are great. Get it to a socket fast. It avoids the user space memory great.

401
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,820
But is it zero copy? Well, it's yes with a question mark.

402
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,690
And then there's VM splice which is memory region to a pipe avoids user space memory.

403
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,239
No and zero copy. Yes. And then

404
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:06,368
there's literally some more results later on where it's just uh

405
00:17:06,469 --> 00:17:09,989
here we go, splice cis call cost two cis calls waking up user space.

406
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,560
Yes, copying cost zero, copy question mark and brackets

407
00:17:13,719 --> 00:17:14,540
interesting,

408
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:15,250
right?

409
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:15,579
So, and,

410
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:18,060
and that's the real you and I have both dealt with Linux kernel issues

411
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:22,489
where trying to define the behavior of a specific version of the Linux kernel,

412
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,569
let alone multiple versions spanning even like version

413
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:28,319
three and four where you have major modifications

414
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,099
is very nontrivial,

415
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,910
you know, especially in the networking space. And you know,

416
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,239
some of these things where there's just so many moving parts

417
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:38,920
and there's been so many changes over the last two decades.

418
00:17:39,369 --> 00:17:39,680
Yeah.

419
00:17:39,829 --> 00:17:41,239
Yeah, I mean, that's,

420
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,280
that's fair.

421
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,010
But at the same time,

422
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,810
there are a small number of people who really

423
00:17:46,819 --> 00:17:49,390
care and for the vast majority of others,

424
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,729
whatever, right? I I feel good because my computer says it's faster than whatever.

425
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:57,209
And I mean, I I'll pick on specter and meltdown here, man.

426
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:01,890
How many instances of specter and meltdown being actually exploited in the wild?

427
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,609
Have you heard of

428
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:06,500
-- the
-- answer is zero, right? It's zero.

429
00:18:06,699 --> 00:18:09,189
And, and I'm not saying it's not being exploited,

430
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,660
but it's one of those things that we everyone lost their minds

431
00:18:12,869 --> 00:18:18,530
for really no reason. I think the reaction to the actual issue was highly overblown

432
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:22,369
and this like deep fix stuff, right? People are freaking out

433
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,640
and the reality is, it's like

434
00:18:24,939 --> 00:18:28,319
it's probably not as bad as you think, but it's easier for github

435
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,719
-- to just be like, yep, we are taking it seriously. Everybody look at us
-- in some ways.

436
00:18:32,729 --> 00:18:34,689
It's worse because you can't

437
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,560
solve this with technology solution.

438
00:18:36,569 --> 00:18:39,380
This is a very fundamental human thing of when humans have

439
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:42,390
been conditioned that when a picture is worth 1000 words,

440
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,439
a picture doesn't lie.

441
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:47,030
Video, never lies. Right. You, you watch surveillance video of a crime?

442
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,719
Yeah, that must be correct. That's what happened.

443
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,589
You know, that's, that's what we've been trained, you know,

444
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:52,530
same thing with DNA evidence in court cases.

445
00:18:52,739 --> 00:18:53,010
You know,

446
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,040
and if you read some of the studies now it turns out

447
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,839
some states in some areas have really messed up their DNA evidence

448
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:00,449
calling into question a lot of criminal convictions.

449
00:19:00,459 --> 00:19:02,069
But, you know, juries have been trained, hey,

450
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:08,079
-- this DNA matches this boom case closed
-- and, and here's what I'm going to go back to

451
00:19:08,219 --> 00:19:12,359
on this topic is the ability to fake video isn't new.

452
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,959
It's just, it's becoming

453
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:19,189
attainable for nearly everybody. Do you remember the hacking tool, Satan

454
00:19:19,469 --> 00:19:20,520
or even, I mean, metas

455
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,310
will, will pick on to a degree.

456
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:25,469
Let's go with Satan because that was such a big kerfuffle.

457
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:29,319
And now it's a professional and nothing happened. Well, not even that.

458
00:19:29,329 --> 00:19:30,770
And now it's a professional product

459
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:31,930
but you're

460
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,189
required by PC I to run

461
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,790
or some version of that tool you're required to run on your knees.

462
00:19:37,489 --> 00:19:39,709
And here's the thing though is, again,

463
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,910
we learn of a new thing

464
00:19:42,109 --> 00:19:43,790
and we all lose our minds

465
00:19:44,109 --> 00:19:48,089
and the world is gonna end because now something that was hard is easy.

466
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:49,150
And in,

467
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:53,599
I would bet you in 99% of those cases

468
00:19:53,869 --> 00:19:56,869
it doesn't matter. And this is even true of security.

469
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,790
We do this all the freaking time, man, where everybody loses their minds because,

470
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,150
I mean,

471
00:20:01,459 --> 00:20:04,439
uh, we could pick on the container runs sea thing, right?

472
00:20:04,449 --> 00:20:06,640
Which we just talked about a little while ago. Is, is

473
00:20:06,859 --> 00:20:10,619
it, is it bad? Yeah, it's bad. Is it as bad as people say? It is?

474
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,579
Probably not.

475
00:20:11,589 --> 00:20:11,819
Well,

476
00:20:11,829 --> 00:20:12,979
it kind of reminds me of like how many

477
00:20:12,989 --> 00:20:16,040
magicians hate Penn and Teller for revealing their secrets.

478
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,800
-- Whatever
-- man, those guys are the best.

479
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:19,180
I know. Exactly.

480
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:21,459
So it's kind of like that there, you know,

481
00:20:21,469 --> 00:20:23,869
magicians used to have that code of never revealing how a

482
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,349
trick is done so that they could protect their industry effectively.

483
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:27,829
Right.

484
00:20:27,979 --> 00:20:29,140
-- Right.
-- In, in, in all.

485
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,050
But here's part of that too is I would

486
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,459
say Penn and Teller have saved the magic industry.

487
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,260
Oh, yeah, they've made it interesting again.

488
00:20:35,439 --> 00:20:38,239
Right. And before them, I remember

489
00:20:38,469 --> 00:20:41,650
so a real long time ago there were a lot of magicians that,

490
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,859
that they claimed they had real magic.

491
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:46,979
And this is actually something Houdini loves to do is he loved to,

492
00:20:46,989 --> 00:20:50,180
to basically trick the Charlatans and catch them in the act.

493
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,030
And of course, the funny enough,

494
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:56,020
one of my favorite quotes from Houdini is I think he was testifying before Congress.

495
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,219
And someone basically said, what's the difference between you and them?

496
00:20:58,229 --> 00:20:59,979
And he said the only difference between me and them

497
00:20:59,989 --> 00:21:02,739
is you will never know how my tricks work.

498
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,930
That's freaking awesome.

499
00:21:05,209 --> 00:21:06,349
Yeah. But anyway,

500
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,209
the point is right is

501
00:21:08,449 --> 00:21:09,589
as humans,

502
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:12,089
we are very bad at assessing situations and

503
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:13,880
you look at something like Penn and Teller.

504
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,859
And I think if you would have looked at it 2030 years ago,

505
00:21:16,869 --> 00:21:19,410
you would have said these guys are going to ruin the magic world

506
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:22,469
and the reality is they probably saved the magic world

507
00:21:22,479 --> 00:21:24,260
now that we can look at it in hindsight.

508
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:28,709
And I think this is very true of, of nearly every situation.

509
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:32,589
Security people look at and say, oh my goodness, the world's gonna end

510
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:36,540
in less than 10% of situations is our reaction

511
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:39,479
actually correct for the severity of the problem.

512
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,859
Well, it's also really hard to

513
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:46,219
have a reaction to something that is air quotes. Correct because

514
00:21:46,459 --> 00:21:48,739
there's so many 2nd and 3rd order effects.

515
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,300
You know, one of my favorite examples of this is,

516
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,199
is a lot of police forces now

517
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:55,770
are putting their graphical information systems online

518
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:59,390
to show crimes like in the last 30 days, last 60 days, you know,

519
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,359
the Edmonton police do it, the London Metropolitan Police do it.

520
00:22:02,869 --> 00:22:06,369
And what the London, what they found in London was, is in richer areas.

521
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,270
People stopped reporting property crimes because they didn't

522
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,719
want to drive their property value down.

523
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,770
Yeah. Right. Exactly. You know. Exactly.

524
00:22:12,979 --> 00:22:16,959
And you can't always think of what's going to happen next.

525
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:17,520
Yeah.

526
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:21,640
Well, and part of it too is human behavior is quite often for lack of a better term,

527
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,089
broken or wrong.

528
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:25,089
And that's just how humans are.

529
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:30,199
And for example, can we teach people to really critically like watch video

530
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:33,810
and not, you know, from a technical point of view, figure out if it's true or not,

531
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,880
but from sort of a critical thinking point of view, say,

532
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:39,380
OK, who produced this video? Why did they release it? What was their agenda?

533
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:43,089
You know, could this, you know what if this video was faked? What

534
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:44,770
you know, why, why would they have done that?

535
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:49,180
You know, for example, if you see a video of a famous politician eating a baby,

536
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:49,939
right,

537
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:54,170
I'm gonna say it's probably fake. I'm really hoping it's fake. But

538
00:22:54,819 --> 00:22:55,339
um

539
00:22:56,369 --> 00:22:56,709
you know,

540
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:59,359
but I feel like a lot of people would act with just

541
00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:03,020
instant outrage and just go from zero to pitchforks and torches,

542
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,290
you know, in 30 seconds.

543
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:11,270
So here's my thought on this is I don't think you're wrong

544
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:16,270
that people will overreact because I think it's human nature to overreact and

545
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:18,189
at the same time

546
00:23:18,459 --> 00:23:20,469
that is fraud,

547
00:23:20,869 --> 00:23:21,380
right?

548
00:23:21,479 --> 00:23:25,030
You can't do things like that to people because it's,

549
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,469
we have laws that govern that and that's where

550
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:32,589
you need proper police investigations

551
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:34,859
to figure out who did this.

552
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,750
And then you go get them

553
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:37,979
because

554
00:23:38,219 --> 00:23:39,319
you can, everyone will say, oh,

555
00:23:39,329 --> 00:23:43,640
but you could do it anonymously and use the black web and blah, dark web, black web,

556
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:44,609
the dark web

557
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,410
and you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

558
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:52,910
But the reality is it's very, very difficult to do things truly anonymously.

559
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,770
And if you do that,

560
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,579
I hope you get caught

561
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,489
and you deserve to get caught.

562
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,959
Well, I just, I can't help but wonder, you know,

563
00:23:59,969 --> 00:24:02,699
with all the election shenanigans going on in

564
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,930
the UK, the US Canada.

565
00:24:04,939 --> 00:24:08,000
And I don't mean like actual shenanigans with the election but just the,

566
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:12,959
the advertising and the, the Facebook postings and all of that influencing stuff

567
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:15,569
that apparently works because again, humans,

568
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:15,989
you know,

569
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,410
they see something and they believe it to be

570
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,800
true because by and large up until recently,

571
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:20,719
we haven't

572
00:24:21,109 --> 00:24:22,209
kind of had,

573
00:24:22,349 --> 00:24:24,930
we've only ever really had sort of propaganda at the state

574
00:24:24,939 --> 00:24:27,729
level where it was kind of obvious it was propaganda.

575
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:32,089
But now, you know, you can have individualized propaganda based on well,

576
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,310
advertising, right?

577
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:35,010
You just use the same techniques we use for online

578
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:38,130
advertising to instead of sell a product to sell an idea

579
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:41,520
and that this political party is evil or that, you know,

580
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:44,229
Brexit is a good idea and sorry, I'm going to go right out here and say,

581
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,589
I think Brexit is a bad idea.

582
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:48,180
I think everybody in Britain pretty much knows it.

583
00:24:48,439 --> 00:24:50,819
And I don't understand how they're not just getting off

584
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:53,689
the crazy train and saying let's not invoke article 50

585
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:58,689
-- maybe just take a breath.
-- So John Oliver has some videos about this you should watch.

586
00:24:58,699 --> 00:24:59,180
It's,

587
00:24:59,469 --> 00:25:01,750
it's insane to say the least.

588
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:04,349
-- Oh yeah,
-- I was reading about Corbyn and May and it's just bonkers.

589
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:05,140
It is.

590
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:09,130
But again, this is, this is how humans work. We are bad at this stuff.

591
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:13,640
Now, here is the ray of sunshine. I will shine down on us all

592
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:18,030
before we end this because I feel like we most of our podcasts like

593
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,630
you're going to be huddled under a blanket by the end of it.

594
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,719
And I'm going to say in

595
00:25:21,849 --> 00:25:23,300
this instance,

596
00:25:23,619 --> 00:25:28,560
I think it's going to be ok, but not yet. We got, we got a ways to go. If you look at

597
00:25:28,709 --> 00:25:31,390
the way the newspaper industry worked

598
00:25:31,729 --> 00:25:33,150
at the turn of the century,

599
00:25:33,579 --> 00:25:35,910
it was super messed up man because

600
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:41,030
you had these newspaper industrialists that were controlling

601
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:45,079
all of the discussions about everything the people they wanted to win

602
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,640
in politics were winning.

603
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:50,099
They would make up news that, that made them look better.

604
00:25:50,109 --> 00:25:53,180
They would cover up stories that could make them look bad.

605
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:57,060
It was crazy town, right? It was very, very messed up.

606
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:00,099
Well, and there was no other way to find out about this stuff. Right.

607
00:26:00,109 --> 00:26:00,260
If,

608
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,900
if it didn't happen in the newspaper or I guess maybe

609
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:05,469
on the radio and back then TV wasn't really a thing.

610
00:26:05,479 --> 00:26:08,420
It just didn't exist much like the Google search results.

611
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:11,510
And, and so here's the thing though is

612
00:26:11,849 --> 00:26:14,660
I think the reason that happened is because

613
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:17,699
humans as a species

614
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:20,849
were unprepared to deal with what was going on around them

615
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,319
and we gained the ability to deal with it.

616
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,099
And now part of it was obviously old people went away

617
00:26:28,109 --> 00:26:30,390
and new people figured out how to deal with it.

618
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,609
I see this with the young people,

619
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:34,599
young people are extremely skeptical of things they see online

620
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:39,560
and my parents believe every freaking thing they read and it's like holy cow.

621
00:26:39,569 --> 00:26:41,479
Oh, it's, it's even worse than that.

622
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:44,250
There's a lawsuit that was announced a few days ago.

623
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,160
Uh course entertainment is this giant

624
00:26:46,589 --> 00:26:49,280
Canadian media conglomerate that owns a bunch of radio stations.

625
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,819
And in Ontario, uh

626
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:54,420
obviously they take advertising on these radio stations.

627
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:58,109
These two scammers ran these ads that were not, well,

628
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:01,020
they were apparently labeled as ads but not so much that you would really notice.

629
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:04,439
But it was like a half hour or something call in show with these financial experts,

630
00:27:04,449 --> 00:27:06,079
giving advice to invest in this company.

631
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:09,800
So people did, they literally based on listening to the radio,

632
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:12,359
these radio shows for a few months or weeks or whatever,

633
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:16,160
invested their life savings into this company that turned out to be a complete scam.

634
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:17,880
Yeah. I'm not at all surprised.

635
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,219
Well, but the best part is now there's a lawsuit against these two guys,

636
00:27:20,229 --> 00:27:21,040
which I totally get

637
00:27:21,209 --> 00:27:22,920
and also against chorus entertainment

638
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:25,380
and I really don't want to blame the victim.

639
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:28,099
But if you listen to a radio program a few times and then

640
00:27:28,109 --> 00:27:31,420
decide based on that to invest your life savings into a company,

641
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,489
how do we protect you from yourself?

642
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,420
People do it, man. People do it all the time. Yeah,

643
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,369
but that's what I mean is how do we, you know,

644
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,319
how do we protect people from themselves when

645
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:46,619
legally speaking, they're adults who have autonomy and agency and are allowed to do

646
00:27:46,819 --> 00:27:48,890
what they want with their money by and large,

647
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,349
you know,

648
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:53,489
how do we stop them from investing in a scam or a multilevel marketing scheme or,

649
00:27:53,619 --> 00:27:56,239
or heck buying beanie babies. You don't or?

650
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,930
Oh, better the fidget spinners,

651
00:27:57,939 --> 00:28:01,250
you know those things that were popular and are now landfill.

652
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:05,719
Uh Yes, I had a lot of them. I ever went to one of the, some conference.

653
00:28:05,739 --> 00:28:08,250
I think it was a black hat conference and I came home with something

654
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:11,530
like 45 fidget spinners for my kids and they thought it was great and

655
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:15,010
I guarantee they're all in the trash now or under the beds. I don't know which.

656
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:15,560
But,

657
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:17,650
and here's the deal, man is,

658
00:28:18,089 --> 00:28:21,359
I'm not saying we should stop. Absolutely. Everything.

659
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:23,939
I think in some instances I'm not going to blame the victims.

660
00:28:23,949 --> 00:28:28,050
I just think this is how humanity works. I'm not saying people are bad necessarily

661
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,300
and there's always going to be some people who, you know,

662
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,709
some apples fall off the cart.

663
00:28:31,719 --> 00:28:33,829
It's just, unfortunately the way it works

664
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:34,739
and

665
00:28:34,869 --> 00:28:37,250
it sucks when it's you. It totally does.

666
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:40,660
But this is also why you need some social structures in place.

667
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:43,949
Like I hope this is illegal and if it's not, it freaking should be

668
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:46,489
and those people should definitely,

669
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,219
granted they're going to get probably sued to death.

670
00:28:48,229 --> 00:28:50,199
I'm sure their money is long gone at this point

671
00:28:50,209 --> 00:28:52,030
and no one's ever going to get anything back.

672
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:52,790
But, I mean,

673
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,479
this is one of those just social constructs where we need things in place.

674
00:28:56,489 --> 00:28:57,810
This is the same thing with, like, the news,

675
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,949
the newspapers can't just make up news anymore because it's illegal.

676
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,030
-- Why? Because they did it
-- well, but they, they can still do opinion pieces

677
00:29:06,324 --> 00:29:09,454
-- which if labeled as such are allowed to be whatever they want.
-- Yes.

678
00:29:09,464 --> 00:29:13,104
And I think that is the next great challenge is going to be

679
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:14,915
what do we do about this?

680
00:29:15,114 --> 00:29:16,984
Because a lot of,

681
00:29:16,994 --> 00:29:21,685
a lot of opinion is being brushed off as news these days and that's obviously not.

682
00:29:21,694 --> 00:29:22,165
Ok.

683
00:29:22,305 --> 00:29:25,694
Well, as fact, I think it's a lot of opinion is being brushed off as fact.

684
00:29:25,844 --> 00:29:27,795
Yes, that's fair. It's still news.

685
00:29:28,364 --> 00:29:30,795
Well, yeah, but I mean, it's just, there's news but then there's news that's,

686
00:29:30,805 --> 00:29:32,385
we know to be factual as

687
00:29:32,675 --> 00:29:32,915
to.

688
00:29:33,569 --> 00:29:36,589
Yeah, I mean, look at us, man, this is totally opinion. Right.

689
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:38,319
Anyone who thinks this is news.

690
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,069
So I don't, I don't know,

691
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:48,270
I feel like this is the next great leap we need to make as a civilization and a culture.

692
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:49,209
And

693
00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:50,930
I think, I think we'll do it.

694
00:29:50,939 --> 00:29:55,119
I really do because the option is basically, you know, the movie Idiocracy.

695
00:29:55,459 --> 00:29:55,890
And

696
00:29:56,239 --> 00:29:56,810
I'm,

697
00:29:57,579 --> 00:30:00,260
I hope we don't end there. And I don't think we will though.

698
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,670
I think if you look at the history of humanity,

699
00:30:02,849 --> 00:30:07,839
the youth have always persevered against whatever craziness is going on.

700
00:30:07,859 --> 00:30:09,410
Whereas the elderly

701
00:30:09,569 --> 00:30:11,949
have a very bad track record here and I don't

702
00:30:11,959 --> 00:30:15,569
look forward to being elderly because everything is changing very fast

703
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,810
and to be clear, we don't mean just to

704
00:30:18,072 --> 00:30:19,762
elderly. But, you know, you look at what was it?

705
00:30:19,772 --> 00:30:22,262
I think it was Plato or Socrates throughout history.

706
00:30:22,703 --> 00:30:27,532
Diatribes written about the, you know how the youth of today is so blah, blah, blah.

707
00:30:27,863 --> 00:30:31,322
Right. Exactly. And it's always been the case and it always will be.

708
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:34,012
And in fact, it's funny, I talk to my kids about this where they're like, oh, so,

709
00:30:34,022 --> 00:30:35,993
and so's mom won't let them play video games.

710
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:36,552
I'm like, eh,

711
00:30:36,662 --> 00:30:38,442
that's up to them. But I mean, let's face it, man.

712
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:42,656
Like this is just life now, you know, play some games. It's it's the way it is.

713
00:30:42,696 --> 00:30:44,286
So, anyway, I,

714
00:30:44,465 --> 00:30:48,735
I think we should call this one before we delve back into some sort of dark,

715
00:30:48,745 --> 00:30:49,735
terrible secret

716
00:30:49,855 --> 00:30:51,416
about humanity.

717
00:30:51,566 --> 00:30:54,276
But no, I do, I think, I think we're going to be ok,

718
00:30:54,316 --> 00:30:57,086
but I think we've got some crazy things to learn along the way.

719
00:30:57,095 --> 00:30:58,265
And I think like we github

720
00:30:58,436 --> 00:30:59,115
is done

721
00:30:59,326 --> 00:30:59,985
is

722
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,949
basically the stop gap

723
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:04,199
that we're going to see more and more people do where

724
00:31:04,209 --> 00:31:06,560
they're going to do things that while not technically correct,

725
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:09,119
and it's good enough and it makes people happy and that's

726
00:31:09,589 --> 00:31:13,400
sometimes that's the best you can do so. All right, sweet. Thank you, Kurt.
