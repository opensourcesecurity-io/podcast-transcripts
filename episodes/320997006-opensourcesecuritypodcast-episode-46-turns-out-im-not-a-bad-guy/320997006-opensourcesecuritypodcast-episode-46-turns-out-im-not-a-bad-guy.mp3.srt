Hello and welcome to episode 46 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,420
Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime.

2
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,199
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:13,890
Merry Christmas. Kurt.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:14,750
Huh?

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,860
Yeah, that, that right.

6
00:00:18,229 --> 00:00:20,129
So yesterday was

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,809
Christmas time for security people because of that crazy Google fish.

8
00:00:24,819 --> 00:00:28,930
I was so excited. It was, it was amazing to see someone

9
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:32,610
mount an attack that while everyone kind of knew could happen,

10
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:36,240
-- we haven't seen like a good worm in a long time and this one
-- a

11
00:00:37,099 --> 00:00:37,200
while

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:37,419
ago,

13
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,799
uh that was less exciting. I felt like, uh, and,

14
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,689
and this one was

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,439
very well done.

16
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,810
I was, I was incredibly impressed

17
00:00:47,389 --> 00:00:50,450
and, and granted, it didn't really do any, any significant damage,

18
00:00:50,459 --> 00:00:51,959
which makes it much nicer as well.

19
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,409
Like if it had taken out half the internet I'd be crying instead of being all excited.

20
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,290
Well, see, and that's,

21
00:00:56,299 --> 00:00:59,330
that's actually the worst thing is it could have done something really nasty, like,

22
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,250
say, replaced a random value in every spreadsheet it found,

23
00:01:03,529 --> 00:01:06,250
you know, and just modify it by like, say 2%.

24
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:09,349
And the funny thing is you, you would have been able to find it.

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,709
Had you been willing to go through your logs of what changed over the last 24 hours,

26
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,580
but who's going to do that?

27
00:01:13,589 --> 00:01:14,010
Right.

28
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:15,330
Google.

29
00:01:16,169 --> 00:01:18,300
Well, but, you know, see here's the thing.

30
00:01:18,309 --> 00:01:22,059
So, like, uh I have, you know, well, like most people, I have Google apps, you know,

31
00:01:22,069 --> 00:01:23,379
for my personal email, right,

32
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,419
or Google, whatever it's called now.

33
00:01:25,529 --> 00:01:30,459
And I actually pay for the Google uh vault, right? The extra

34
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,809
uh and the nice thing is it gives you insane audit trails.

35
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:38,709
Like, for example, my calendars, every single thing, addition change removal,

36
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,699
everything is audited and like logged and you can go

37
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:43,879
through those logs and search them and export them.

38
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,830
So the reality is like a worm like this.

39
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:50,069
Yeah, it could have been like, let's say for the sake of argument,

40
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,089
it did do something terrible like delete stuff or modify stuff.

41
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,769
You actually could have like programmatically

42
00:01:56,129 --> 00:01:57,269
cleaned up after it.

43
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:01,370
And my thinking is like, you know, it's like those crypto locker viruses where you,

44
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:03,290
you know, these people can't, they have no,

45
00:02:03,489 --> 00:02:05,680
they have no like imagine a crypto locker virus

46
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,489
that instead of crypto locking just said was like,

47
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,529
I may or may not have randomly changed some values in your financial.

48
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:13,419
It would be

49
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,029
probably more powerful.

50
00:02:16,529 --> 00:02:16,949
Yeah.

51
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:18,309
Um

52
00:02:18,809 --> 00:02:21,949
So I'm I'm kind of curious it, it's interesting to me now because in theory, you know,

53
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,710
because all this,

54
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,850
we have these huge audit trails and we have all this data stored by Google

55
00:02:27,059 --> 00:02:30,660
in a way where, you know, even if it's deleted, it's, it's not really gone anymore.

56
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,190
Yeah. And that's kind of something I suspect is

57
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,710
even if you're not paying for their vault,

58
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:41,300
I bet they could undo any changes and let's face it too. So true

59
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,100
story.

60
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:42,369
Yeah.

61
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,149
Uh, person I know,

62
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,570
um,

63
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,979
their email account at Google, um, got,

64
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:50,100
uh,

65
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:52,250
the organization deleted it.

66
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,250
This person because of who they are in

67
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,350
the industry was able to find somebody at Google

68
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,029
to have them reinstate the account and recover it.

69
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,360
Right.

70
00:03:02,369 --> 00:03:03,970
So it's, it's technically possible for them to,

71
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,750
it's just normally they don't do that because, you know, it's such a hassle, right?

72
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,500
They don't want to get support calls being like

73
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,339
dip, I accidentally deleted my account. Can you please fix it?

74
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,380
But the reality is like that stuff.

75
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:13,660
I mean,

76
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:16,720
obviously Google has backups because you know what if one of their

77
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:19,750
data sensors catches fire or what if all of them catch fire?

78
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:22,320
-- I
-- don't know if they have backups in the traditional

79
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,399
sense as much as just massive replication of data.

80
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,089
-- They do have offline backups.
-- They do good for them.

81
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,000
But I mean, I think fundamentally this is one of the things with cloud,

82
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:35,759
people need to make sure they understand is if you hit delete

83
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,399
it, it's never gone.

84
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,279
It.

85
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,559
I guarantee

86
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,000
that data sticks around probably forever.

87
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,509
Well, but the, the, probably the closest we'll ever get to being gone is,

88
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,600
you know, all the backups are encrypted now, obviously, because, you know,

89
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,500
backup tapes do get lost

90
00:03:53,899 --> 00:03:56,589
or forgotten or sent to the wrong address.

91
00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:00,470
Um So the, the generally speaking, the closest we'll get to delete it is, you know,

92
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:02,509
crypto shredding of the keys that would

93
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:03,660
un encrypt the data.

94
00:04:04,429 --> 00:04:06,839
I, I bet they don't even go that far.

95
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,580
Uh The, well, depending on which organization it is. Some do.

96
00:04:10,779 --> 00:04:15,210
-- It's
-- probably for, for example, I know in, in like elastic search,

97
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,640
when you delete data, it doesn't really get deleted, it's just mark deleted,

98
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:19,750
it's all still there.

99
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:21,920
And the thing is too, is,

100
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,880
-- is properly deleting data is like horrendously difficult and
-- it takes a long

101
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,209
time and when you're really concerned about latency and things like that,

102
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,209
like who cares, do it later

103
00:04:30,679 --> 00:04:33,350
and there's ways to force it to happen like

104
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:35,339
where you condense your indexes and things like that.

105
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,109
But fundamentally,

106
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:36,709
no,

107
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,279
because what if your elastic search is sitting on some sort of NFS file system

108
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,260
that's abstracted and actually running on a cluster

109
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:44,239
file system that's actually running on an SSD

110
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:47,709
ignoring that, right? Just in the context of

111
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:50,359
data store. So anyway, I am

112
00:04:50,609 --> 00:04:51,390
not done

113
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,989
with the Google Fish

114
00:04:53,109 --> 00:04:57,350
because I love this story and, and I want to tell you what happened to me

115
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,589
and I'm, I'm smiling, I'm so giddy. It's not even funny. So anyway,

116
00:05:02,059 --> 00:05:04,480
I'm on a phone call. I have a meeting. Right.

117
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,839
And my wife barges into my office and says

118
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:12,279
I've just been hacked someone, sending everyone in my contact list emails.

119
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:13,380
And I thought, oh,

120
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,329
ok. Well, that's exciting.

121
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:15,880
Right.

122
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:20,239
And so I, I get up, well, the first thing I did was I said, bring me your computer

123
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,709
and, and of course, so she does. And the first thing I did is I logged.

124
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,880
I too use Google apps.

125
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:29,410
I log in as my account administrator and I just lock her account.

126
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,190
I sign out all sessions and I change her password, right?

127
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,980
And I thought, ok, now we'll go and uh

128
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,549
II I set her up with, with uh

129
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,600
last pass and UB key for, for U two F and all that stuff, right? And I'm getting her,

130
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,209
I'm walking her through it and whatnot.

131
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,670
And then I come back to my office and I sit down and I see the email from her

132
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,390
and I thought, oh, ok. Well, let's see what this is right.

133
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,720
And I look at it and think

134
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,519
this is good, right? Like

135
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,480
it. So, I don't know. Did, did you get one?

136
00:05:57,929 --> 00:05:59,920
I sadly did not,

137
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,040
you're just not cool enough, Kurt.

138
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,739
So anyway, anyway, so here's what happened is

139
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:10,190
you get the email and it basically says like so and so shared a

140
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,440
Google document with you and it looked just like the Google Docs sharing email.

141
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,320
The, the email looks fairly legitimate

142
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:17,450
and

143
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:20,869
you open it up it appears to be a Google Docs sharing email.

144
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:21,720
And

145
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,899
so I click the open button

146
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,119
and the first thing it does is it says,

147
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,299
which account do you want to open this with for Google?

148
00:06:29,309 --> 00:06:31,329
Because obviously everyone has more than one Google account.

149
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:33,200
And I thought this is new. Right.

150
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,339
So I, I click on my, uh, funny enough, my kids account

151
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,540
is the one I have.

152
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,440
Right. Right.

153
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:43,049
Well, they don't send email, they don't have contacts, things like that.

154
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,010
So anyway, uh I click their account

155
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,690
and then it asks if I want to allow Google Docs

156
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,290
and it has all the Google icons and everything,

157
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,589
Google Docs to have access to my email and basically everything, right?

158
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,529
Like full access.

159
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,730
And I thought that's not right.

160
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,079
And so basically I, I went back and I pulled apart the email

161
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,209
that I got to just see what's going on and

162
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,399
it turned out it was pointing at a another domain.

163
00:07:09,869 --> 00:07:10,140
And

164
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,630
uh well, no, no, the mail was all your mail was CC demin.

165
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:19,160
That's how they were harvesting kind of the contact lens. That's

166
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,670
what that ends up being.

167
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,540
But then uh so basically what it was, it was in, in an o

168
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:30,709
off request for all access to some site. That was, it was very well done

169
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,480
in, in terms of what it was named.

170
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:33,910
And then,

171
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:37,220
right? So obviously this was not Google, it was just, this is how OO

172
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:38,190
works

173
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,170
in the context of allowing just

174
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:43,779
for a quick maybe run down for our viewers. What exactly is oo

175
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,029
it, it's kind of a, an authorization system that exists on the internet.

176
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,269
Like when you, when you try to log into something, it says log in with Google,

177
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,130
that's essentially o

178
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:56,980
off and part of that system says you can grant access to certain information.

179
00:07:56,989 --> 00:07:57,829
So for example,

180
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,410
when for at a minimum, it needs to know who you are from Google

181
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:02,940
and then certain things like actually that,

182
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,970
that unroll me thing we talked about last time

183
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:07,149
was this where enroll me?

184
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,000
Told Google, hey, uh I want access to all this person's email and of course,

185
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,350
the person has to accept it.

186
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:13,989
Same thing here, right?

187
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,890
So anyway, my story is not done though.

188
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,190
So anyway, I, I figure out what's going on and I'm like, oh man,

189
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,350
this is an oath attack like this is super cool.

190
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:25,070
I get all excited and I'm like, oh, no, wait and I go running through the house.

191
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:28,140
I get to my wife like, give me your computer right now and she's like, what's going on?

192
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:31,545
I said just give it to, we don't have questions and I like taken from her

193
00:08:31,785 --> 00:08:33,734
and I go into her Google settings and I,

194
00:08:33,744 --> 00:08:38,054
and I remove that application from having access to her account right immediately.

195
00:08:38,135 --> 00:08:39,025
And she's like, what's going on?

196
00:08:39,034 --> 00:08:41,155
I'm like, stop talking, I'll tell you in a minute, you know,

197
00:08:41,424 --> 00:08:44,804
it's like, I'm typing furiously to get to what needs to be done.

198
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,510
And anyway, then it gets done.

199
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,030
I tried to explain it to her and she mostly understood it.

200
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:54,190
But, but the fundamental thing and here's what it really has me. So excited is

201
00:08:54,369 --> 00:08:57,409
what are the things we'd love to talk about in security? We love to talk about.

202
00:08:57,419 --> 00:09:00,229
Uh, make sure you give your user awareness training, which doesn't work.

203
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:02,739
And then we say, well, why don't you two factor authentication?

204
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,710
But in this instance, two factor a

205
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:08,640
does not help you because you're already authenticated.

206
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,260
It's just someone's tricking you into giving a a

207
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:14,559
malicious site access to all of your Google data.

208
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,510
I'm like this is like the perfect attack, right? It's, it's brilliant.

209
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,950
Yeah. No, I'm just, I'm actually looking at. So if you go to my account, do,

210
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,340
for example, with Google,

211
00:09:23,469 --> 00:09:27,780
you go to my account.google.com/permissions and that shows

212
00:09:27,789 --> 00:09:29,400
you which apps are connected to your account.

213
00:09:29,789 --> 00:09:32,580
So obviously, my Google Chrome has full access to my account.

214
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,250
At least I hope that's my Google Chrome.

215
00:09:34,549 --> 00:09:36,710
Uh Same for my I Os and Os X.

216
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,710
And then I have a thing called Pixar Express

217
00:09:40,719 --> 00:09:42,770
that I don't remember giving access to something.

218
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,020
What the

219
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:43,669
heck is that?

220
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:43,859
OK.

221
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:46,250
Remove that.

222
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,169
So yeah, I I myself have something I'm looking at and I do not recognize it.

223
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,150
I bet that's super common because people

224
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,489
give access to stuff all the time.

225
00:09:55,434 --> 00:09:58,255
Everything else has access to just basic account info,

226
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:01,335
which basically means like feed le or discuss whatever it just, yeah,

227
00:10:01,344 --> 00:10:04,474
it knows who I am so that I can authenticate to that service.

228
00:10:04,864 --> 00:10:08,614
But so yeah, perfect example. I had that Pixl dot whatever the hell that was

229
00:10:08,864 --> 00:10:11,594
and I don't, I don't recall at all what that was

230
00:10:11,835 --> 00:10:12,724
interesting.

231
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:16,789
Um I think it was an image editing thing that I might have fired up for some.

232
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,989
But uh regardless, this is a great example because, yeah,

233
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,570
even as a security professional, I clearly at some point whiffed one of these.

234
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:25,830
But

235
00:10:25,969 --> 00:10:26,960
here's the thing actually,

236
00:10:26,969 --> 00:10:30,820
if my wife hadn't run in the room and said I'm being hacked,

237
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,940
if I would have just opened that mail from her,

238
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:37,460
I would have been like, well, this is a little weird but OK,

239
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,260
and

240
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:41,299
I, I'm not saying I would or wouldn't have,

241
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:44,669
but I don't think clicking the allow Google docs access to

242
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:47,219
my stuff would have been out of the question at all

243
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,440
because it looked,

244
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:51,059
it looked really legit. I'm not gonna lie to you. I mean,

245
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:56,169
it looked good. The, these people, they did a great job making it look good.

246
00:10:57,599 --> 00:10:59,460
Yeah. No, this is what gets me is um

247
00:11:00,109 --> 00:11:02,570
the majority of protocols,

248
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,619
especially security protocols and authentication protocols

249
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,359
don't really seem to have a graceful failure scenario for

250
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:12,400
when an attacker uses them to impersonate somebody else.

251
00:11:12,409 --> 00:11:12,739
I mean,

252
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,580
uh TLS and SSL are a great example, right? Oh Look for the lock icon.

253
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:20,280
-- Well, except, you know, now you can get an SSL actually.
-- Could you bring that up?

254
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:24,369
Because obviously that's the first thing I did is I looked at the URL bar saying,

255
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:30,130
where am I? Right? I'm on google.com. I have the green EV cert.

256
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,659
So I'm thinking all right, this looks legit, right? Like,

257
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,809
and that's the thing everything we've ever taught people

258
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:40,390
failed in this instance because we were not prepared for this instance.

259
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,510
However, however, here's the one thing I will say

260
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:43,210
is

261
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,890
there, it would be very difficult to defend against this.

262
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:51,859
But what Google did is exactly the right thing is they acted quickly in like an hour.

263
00:11:51,869 --> 00:11:52,700
This was shut down.

264
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,780
You think about that an hour, how many,

265
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:59,460
-- how many it departments can respond
-- in this specific attack was shut down quickly.

266
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:00,989
But the problem is the fundamental,

267
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,299
here's what I have with this attack is that

268
00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:05,940
fundamentally you can't stop this attack because it's,

269
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,299
it's like a name space problem, right?

270
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:09,979
And even if for example, this um

271
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:13,900
like for example, Google could show the domain name that the

272
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,539
oath request is coming from as part of that request.

273
00:12:16,549 --> 00:12:18,190
I think that would be reasonable.

274
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,229
And also it said Google docs,

275
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:23,510
Kurt like Google should not allow anything with Google's name in it.

276
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,489
But what about

277
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,059
uh

278
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:25,820
well, what about

279
00:12:26,044 --> 00:12:29,664
like, you know gmail or what about, you know, the problem is there's so many

280
00:12:31,255 --> 00:12:31,635
stuff.

281
00:12:32,054 --> 00:12:32,575
I don't know

282
00:12:32,914 --> 00:12:34,914
what I'm saying is from a name space perspective.

283
00:12:34,924 --> 00:12:39,195
There's so many keywords and words that have special meaning like admin or

284
00:12:39,434 --> 00:12:41,315
support or,

285
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:46,909
you know, help or like you get an email from like help or support or something,

286
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:49,219
you know, chances are it's gonna fool enough people.

287
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:54,989
-- Right. Well,
-- ok. Yes. And, and I think the right way to handle this is to lay down

288
00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:56,900
some level of sane rules.

289
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:59,950
Like for example, I think saying nothing with Google in the name or,

290
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,320
or if it has Google in the name,

291
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:05,469
make a human click the OK button after they verify what's going on.

292
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,799
But I think the right answer is to

293
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,299
not over engineer this but wait for things to happen

294
00:13:12,309 --> 00:13:15,349
like this and then just fix that particular instance.

295
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:17,070
But see the problem is perfect example,

296
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,169
I've actually had this happen to me is when we went to cloud flare,

297
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:22,330
uh the cloud security lines went to cloud flare.

298
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:22,760
You know,

299
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:26,000
supposedly cloud flare will be all automated provisioning will

300
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,590
happen in minutes and you'll be up and running.

301
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,239
So I click turn on SSL and guess what happens?

302
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,409
Nothing.

303
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,270
-- Uh
-- You told me this story because you were using something weird

304
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,859
-- because the
-- word we have the word security in our domain.

305
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:42,510
And so it required a human check and I did this on a Friday afternoon

306
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,520
and it didn't get handled, I think until Sunday or Monday.

307
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:49,169
And that was because of the, the, the higher level registrar,

308
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:49,830
I think it was like Komodo

309
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:50,679
or whoever

310
00:13:50,859 --> 00:13:53,400
was handling it, you know, that was, it was their thing. Right.

311
00:13:53,409 --> 00:13:54,489
It was kind of outside of

312
00:13:55,469 --> 00:13:57,530
exactly the right way to do this.

313
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,030
Well,

314
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,815
but the problem is then you end up pissing

315
00:13:59,825 --> 00:14:02,875
the number of false positives is going to be huge

316
00:14:03,114 --> 00:14:07,984
because your restricted keyword list is going to have to be huge. What if I use IBM?

317
00:14:07,994 --> 00:14:10,405
Or what if I use, uh Compu

318
00:14:10,575 --> 00:14:12,885
Corp or what if I use? You know what I mean?

319
00:14:13,195 --> 00:14:13,984
Walmart?

320
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,369
I,

321
00:14:15,609 --> 00:14:18,549
I'm ok with that. I think if you're running it,

322
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,890
how does Walmart legitimately tie into it?

323
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:22,250
Maybe they don't.

324
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:23,349
Well,

325
00:14:23,359 --> 00:14:25,090
but now you're not going to allow Walmart to run

326
00:14:25,099 --> 00:14:27,719
any apps that allow people to authenticate via Google.

327
00:14:27,729 --> 00:14:29,559
-- Well, no,
-- no, no, you certainly do.

328
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:33,359
But you, you add an extra layer of protection, I think.

329
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,630
Uh, see,

330
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,059
I disagree because fundamentally you're going to

331
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,299
get people just doing click through.

332
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:37,760
Ok.

333
00:14:39,909 --> 00:14:42,080
Right. We tried that. Remember Windows vista?

334
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,049
This is different.

335
00:14:46,349 --> 00:14:50,440
It's not different. You're gonna ask people, are you really sure you want to give ft

336
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:52,969
full access to your Google Drive?

337
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,010
Yes or no.

338
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,890
If they click, no, the service doesn't work and they're like, well,

339
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,090
what the heck just happened

340
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,280
if you click? Yes, it works and nothing bad.

341
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,559
-- No, no, I
-- don't.

342
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:05,369
No. Ok. I think we're talking about two different things. I'm saying

343
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,119
if I'm trying to register

344
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:10,630
something against Google to use o

345
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:10,979
of

346
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,359
because obviously you have to register

347
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,880
against their service.

348
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:19,619
And I'm saying if the name, if the word Google appears in the service,

349
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,880
you're trying to register

350
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,200
Google should say,

351
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,719
hold on their buddy

352
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:28,960
and then have either extra hoops to jump through to do some extra verification or

353
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:32,239
just have a human being at Google. Look at this and say,

354
00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:33,909
yeah, this is fine because it's like,

355
00:15:34,369 --> 00:15:34,830
you know, Googly

356
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,010
Eyes dot Commerce.

357
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,020
-- So
-- the problem is it would have to be automated because otherwise it's not going

358
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:42,250
to scale because the Attackers are going to send in billions of these requests,

359
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,739
right? Because you can just set the o

360
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,400
off name.

361
00:15:44,869 --> 00:15:48,729
Well, yes, but if it doesn't scale like that and, and you have a problem with it,

362
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,330
then just deny them all

363
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:54,200
right. And, and if you want to get it, then pay Google,

364
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:57,460
you know what I mean? Like become a proper customer and give them money.

365
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,679
Like that's the thing, right?

366
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:03,590
You need to make sure there's a certain barrier of entry here that makes it too.

367
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:06,849
It's like you were talking about this uh some time ago about when

368
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:10,049
you register a domain name charging people like a quarter to prevent those.

369
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,989
That's what I'm talking about here is you need to have some sort of barrier to entry.

370
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:17,270
Sorry, I thought you meant the end users

371
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:17,900
were doing

372
00:16:18,289 --> 00:16:19,179
actual Google

373
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:19,690
that makes

374
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:19,940
more

375
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:20,239
sense.

376
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,260
Users are the product, right? Like ignore those guys.

377
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:26,549
So that makes a bit of sense. Yeah, I mean,

378
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,309
in that case,

379
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,070
but the problem I see with this though is that

380
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,989
Google would have to have a huge list of keywords

381
00:16:32,169 --> 00:16:34,070
and people would still fall for it. I mean,

382
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:36,309
the the great example is right now, you know,

383
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,909
the revenue Canada has sent out multiple bulletins saying like first of all,

384
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:41,789
we're not going to phone you,

385
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:42,989
right?

386
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,530
Second of all,

387
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:46,510
we're only going to email you if you have registered an account with us.

388
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,640
And third of all,

389
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:51,809
we definitely don't take payment of taxes and itunes gift cards over the phone.

390
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,320
-- Like really we don't,
-- that could be a huge business model,

391
00:16:55,659 --> 00:16:58,770
you know, and and it's getting to the point now where, you know, it's, it's

392
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:03,809
like this one lady um uh had a newborn, she was super sleep deprived

393
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,650
and she's lost her life savings because she, you know, like

394
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,880
-- you take somebody who is insanely sleep deprived and yeah, you know,
-- ok, but so,

395
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,079
so here's the thing

396
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,638
what you describe

397
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:19,578
sounds like revenue Canada is taking what I

398
00:17:19,588 --> 00:17:23,638
would call acceptable steps to mitigate this threat,

399
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:24,979
but they can't mitigate it, right?

400
00:17:24,989 --> 00:17:27,368
They can educate the people, they can't actually stop it from happening,

401
00:17:27,378 --> 00:17:29,129
they cannot stop it from happening.

402
00:17:29,139 --> 00:17:33,788
But if you can make sure it's ok for let's say 80% of the population,

403
00:17:33,798 --> 00:17:36,288
that's good enough and that's the best you're gonna get.

404
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:37,989
You're never gonna get it through 100%.

405
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,410
And let's face it, man.

406
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,229
We've been around long enough to know that,

407
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:45,609
that like 20% of the population can basically basically be tricked into anything.

408
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,890
-- And,
-- and well, see, my concern is for, from Google's perspective,

409
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,260
is it worth building this thing?

410
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,530
Like does it, you know, reduce their cost,

411
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,469
does it improve their brand enough to get more customers?

412
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:56,689
-- Does anybody
-- care?

413
00:17:57,069 --> 00:18:00,810
Uh Right. I think there's two sides to this coin. On one side,

414
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,640
Google has to ensure whatever they're doing,

415
00:18:03,829 --> 00:18:07,069
helps maintain their revenue stream and their trust.

416
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:10,790
Because a lot of what Google does is built on trust, people, trust Google. OK.

417
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:14,310
-- And I know I can we
-- go back to the Galaxy Seven argument. We

418
00:18:14,569 --> 00:18:15,150
-- argue
-- that

419
00:18:15,729 --> 00:18:16,089
we can

420
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,229
-- argue
-- that you can set stuff on fire and people don't seem to mind it.

421
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,930
-- But
-- here's the other side of it is I think at this

422
00:18:21,939 --> 00:18:24,640
point and I think Google has recognized this to a degree.

423
00:18:24,829 --> 00:18:27,880
Google is an organization now that I think there are

424
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:31,000
certain expectations of them to act in the public.

425
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:31,510
Good

426
00:18:31,949 --> 00:18:34,670
because they run the freaking world.

427
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,030
Yeah, it's, well,

428
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,589
it's interesting to me because kind of at what point do they become

429
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:42,859
a utility essentially in the sense of like from a regulatory and public

430
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,900
use and good point of view, right? Because,

431
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:47,699
and I would argue that they're very definitely there.

432
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:51,339
I, I, I don't think you're wrong but they're,

433
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:53,780
-- they would disagree. I'm sure
-- of

434
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:54,209
course they would

435
00:18:54,729 --> 00:18:55,489
disagree. But

436
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,380
the reality is like, you know, here's the thing.

437
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:02,300
Um, you have to give up Gmail forever or running water forever.

438
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,369
And the fact is you're going to think about

439
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,930
-- it.
-- No, I would give up Gmail before running water.

440
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,939
But only because I've read a lot of

441
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:14,369
stories about what life was like before plumbing existed

442
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:14,569
and

443
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:15,250
for the

444
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:15,599
sake of

445
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,290
cholera,

446
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,979
you can live off the grid and you have to

447
00:19:18,989 --> 00:19:21,290
do your own electricity or you can give up Gmail.

448
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:22,819
Let's face it.

449
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:26,510
Building your own little mini grid would be a lot easier than having your own email,

450
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,900
docs and stuff at this point.

451
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,729
-- It
-- sounds like fun to build my own grid.

452
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:31,829
Yeah,

453
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,770
but I mean, that's the thing, right?

454
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,380
Is like the fact that you're not just, you know,

455
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:38,449
it'd be like the difference between giving up like candy and you know, whatever,

456
00:19:38,459 --> 00:19:38,640
right?

457
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,410
Everybody would be like I give up candy fine. It's awesome, you know. But

458
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,189
I mean,

459
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:46,349
yeah, that what really worries me though is like at some point.

460
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,729
Yeah, I just

461
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,089
these,

462
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:54,319
you don't want to introduce the other concern I have is with these security measures

463
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:55,900
is you don't want to introduce security measures

464
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,819
that have a high rate of false positives

465
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,810
and a low rate of actually catching the bad guys

466
00:20:00,819 --> 00:20:03,290
and maybe a low rate of actually being effective.

467
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:05,829
And that would be part of my concern with this is that

468
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,170
you filter out maybe certain keywords

469
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:11,589
and yeah, you'll get some of the low hanging fruit. But fundamentally,

470
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:12,800
I mean,

471
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,089
uh my take on it would be maybe more that, that, you know,

472
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:19,989
when I grant access to Google Docs to an app,

473
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:23,199
you know, it'd be really nice if I could just give it access to a single folder,

474
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:24,400
right?

475
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,550
So I could have like that one folder for, you know,

476
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,530
using with whatever that Pixar thing I had was instead of everything of it,

477
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,109
you know what I mean?

478
00:20:31,489 --> 00:20:34,589
Or for example, that, you know, it created uh like

479
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:34,770
a

480
00:20:35,439 --> 00:20:37,469
like, you know, it created sort of like a quasi

481
00:20:37,579 --> 00:20:41,250
user called pixel or that I could then assign access to the, you know,

482
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,699
the documents and stuff I actually wanted to interact with,

483
00:20:44,229 --> 00:20:47,550
you know, the downside of that being is that everything just doesn't work anymore,

484
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:47,619
right?

485
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,040
You have to go through a whole bunch of extra

486
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,589
steps to set up security and permissions and travel,

487
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,119
avise me if they've discussed things like this before.

488
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:54,660
But I think there's,

489
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:59,089
there's also one other really important point we have to make sure we discuss is

490
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:03,880
this exact attack was described in 2011 on a mailing

491
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,530
list which I'll put a link in the show notes

492
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:08,069
and, and anyone who understands oo

493
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:12,079
is well aware that this has always been a possibility.

494
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,209
But here's, here's my question though.

495
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:17,510
This was described in detail in 2011.

496
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,439
And it took essentially six years before anyone did it.

497
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,300
Well,

498
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:23,479
six years until we found out anyone did a

499
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,410
worm,

500
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:30,939
I'm sure there have been similar attacks. And that, that leads me to really wonder,

501
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,219
did the person who did this,

502
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,800
did they screw up where it wasn't supposed to worm itself?

503
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,910
It was just supposed to attack their target, you know,

504
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,280
X fill whatever I assume they're looking for, for contacts

505
00:21:42,449 --> 00:21:43,300
to be X filled

506
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,119
and then they somehow goofed it up.

507
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:49,089
So it turned into a worm on accident or did someone legitimately create the worm?

508
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,829
I think you'd legitimately have to create the

509
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:52,969
worm because to accidentally worm something is,

510
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,339
you know, it's a bit of nontrivial work.

511
00:21:54,349 --> 00:21:54,670
But

512
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,199
I would say even more fundamentally,

513
00:21:56,209 --> 00:21:59,880
this problem boils down to something we've known for decades, which is when you let

514
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,579
anybody choose any name and present it as being like, hey, I'm Google.

515
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,709
Really? That, that's what this says,

516
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:07,670
you know.

517
00:22:08,109 --> 00:22:11,500
Right. Like it's when my old ISP, let you choose your host name.

518
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:14,650
And I tried admin and that was a reserved keyword and I tried support and that

519
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:18,290
was a reserved keyword and I tried local hosting that was not a reserved keyword.

520
00:22:18,435 --> 00:22:19,175
Sweet.

521
00:22:19,344 --> 00:22:21,574
-- And then you have to actually call them on the phone,
-- right?

522
00:22:21,584 --> 00:22:23,694
Because, yeah, because my internet like collapsed

523
00:22:24,704 --> 00:22:28,714
because the way DNS works is you look, when you look up a name, first of all,

524
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:31,344
you look up name dot whatever your search domain is,

525
00:22:31,744 --> 00:22:36,494
then if that doesn't work, you look up that name, you know. So in.

526
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:37,489
Yeah.

527
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,810
So I basically got hammered with everybody's local host traffic to some degree

528
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:44,910
for badly behaving apps, right? Because realistically anyways,

529
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:45,719
yeah,

530
00:22:45,729 --> 00:22:48,319
but the point being is whenever you've allowed people to present a

531
00:22:48,329 --> 00:22:53,290
name with absolutely no third party verification or very limited verification.

532
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:53,619
Like

533
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:57,569
for example, you know, SSL and TLS domain verification, it's like,

534
00:22:57,719 --> 00:22:59,839
yeah, I registered this domain and I control it.

535
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:03,880
That proves that I am food.com, which is technically correct.

536
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:07,420
But that doesn't prove that like legally you should have the rights to food.com.

537
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,099
You know,

538
00:23:09,719 --> 00:23:11,810
a great example being like in Australia,

539
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:13,849
apparently Burger King is not Burger King because

540
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,650
somebody already had Burger King in Australia.

541
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:18,050
So Burger King in Australia is hungry. Jack's

542
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,119
interesting.

543
00:23:19,479 --> 00:23:21,319
I, you know, if I'd gone to Australia

544
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:25,650
and gone to a Burger King, I would have been like, what the heck is wrong with the menu,

545
00:23:25,689 --> 00:23:26,489
you know, like

546
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:28,219
I would have been very confused.

547
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:29,010
And

548
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,209
-- so
-- here

549
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,660
essentially the bad guys can do this globally though, right?

550
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:34,780
They can grab any domain name.

551
00:23:36,829 --> 00:23:38,079
Yeah, they can grab any domain

552
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:38,890
Google dot

553
00:23:39,479 --> 00:23:42,920
Yeah, but if you look, if you, if you take like Google dot something,

554
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,599
they're gonna come get you and they're gonna get it back.

555
00:23:45,609 --> 00:23:48,599
All right. That's the reality of it. No, they, they're going to

556
00:23:48,849 --> 00:23:50,329
maybe if, if, like, if I go by

557
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,189
cried dot CX or something and put like, porn on it.

558
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:56,079
No, you probably can't do anything about it, but Google can.

559
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,579
True.

560
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:58,500
But I, I,

561
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:01,439
and that brings up one of my favorite things with all these new top level

562
00:24:01,449 --> 00:24:04,339
domains is one of the main selling points for like dot sucks was like,

563
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,650
you probably wanna do uh defensive registries.

564
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:09,939
And that's kind of,

565
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:12,829
I was actually thinking about registering like a root top level domain.

566
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:13,910
The whole point of it being

567
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:16,260
it was, that's like 100 grand, isn't it to get

568
00:24:16,449 --> 00:24:18,239
100 and $80,000 in the US?

569
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,239
But when you look like we registered dot Watch domain

570
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,709
and it was like 500 bucks for a year.

571
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:27,979
So, I mean, you only need a couple 1000 registrations to break even.

572
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,500
-- I'm just saying
-- only

573
00:24:31,969 --> 00:24:34,829
except I'm man, I bet it's so much work to do that.

574
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:39,430
Um Well, there's a couple of 100 new top level domains. So, I mean, there's a

575
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:39,709
lot of

576
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:40,250
people,

577
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,630
you know, and if you look at,

578
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,880
I was actually looking through the people applying to be these top level domains,

579
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,979
some of them were Big corps that you would expect,

580
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:50,339
right? Like big DNS registers, whatever and some of them were like

581
00:24:50,479 --> 00:24:52,569
as far as I could tell like a guy

582
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:57,280
uh yeah, there was uh Oh, I forget I was talking to some guys from,

583
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,550
I think it was Blue Coat one time and they were talking about there,

584
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,949
there was this one TLD

585
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,719
that was, it looked like it was owned by literally like a guy

586
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:11,180
and it was like 99% of the traffic that came from these domains was malicious.

587
00:25:11,609 --> 00:25:16,560
Like it was clearly set up for, for tricking people and that's all it was done for.

588
00:25:17,209 --> 00:25:18,239
No, I've thought about this

589
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:22,369
as you know, but it turns out I'm not a bad guy so

590
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:23,930
that we know of.

591
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,030
Yeah, true.

592
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:28,729
But uh no, I mean, that's, that's what gets me is, is um I mean,

593
00:25:28,739 --> 00:25:29,949
that's one of the reasons I like the UB

594
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:33,180
key and the uh the that authentication protocol is,

595
00:25:33,189 --> 00:25:34,729
it includes the domain name

596
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,349
in the authentication process

597
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:40,170
which really helps cut down on the fishing stuff on the UB key. And,

598
00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:42,849
but the problem is if you're authenticating against

599
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,770
some random domain where it's

600
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:45,839
like the

601
00:25:46,089 --> 00:25:49,609
Google doesn't show me really the domain that that request came from.

602
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:51,589
You know, it shows me the a

603
00:25:51,699 --> 00:25:53,959
name like a great example here is I see.

604
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:54,930
Um

605
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:55,530
I

606
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:55,650
do

607
00:25:58,109 --> 00:25:58,130
it.

608
00:25:58,689 --> 00:26:00,579
OK. So here's the deal. I'm gonna stop you though

609
00:26:00,689 --> 00:26:01,160
is

610
00:26:02,739 --> 00:26:06,410
I suspect the right way to handle this is

611
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:11,780
using Google to authenticate authenticate against an unknown domain

612
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:15,349
is great because now you've got a very limited o

613
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,760
off trust relationship. The trick is

614
00:26:17,949 --> 00:26:19,890
Google needs a nicer way

615
00:26:20,109 --> 00:26:26,010
to make people requesting additional permissions outside of just who am I?

616
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,939
They need to add hoops there

617
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,839
because this comes back to that 25 cents to register a domain

618
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:35,709
because let any Tom Dick or Harry off people against

619
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:38,599
you because that's actually very useful and far more secure than

620
00:26:38,609 --> 00:26:41,359
people picking crappy user names and passwords for every stupid

621
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:43,859
website they need to use like every forum on earth.

622
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:44,359
Right?

623
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,719
But there is no reason

624
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:50,589
for a like random site to read your email.

625
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,260
Well, I mean, unless it's something I want, like it's a spell checker

626
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,229
or I've been seeing

627
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:55,560
a

628
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,469
thing that checks your grammar and actually just one comment too.

629
00:26:58,479 --> 00:26:59,000
I'm looking at the my

630
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,989
account.google.com/permissions thing,

631
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,479
for example, I click on Ed X, right? Uh That

632
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:06,920
online university thing doesn't show me the domain.

633
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:10,739
It just shows me Ed X and their logo and remove and it says when I

634
00:27:10,854 --> 00:27:11,444
authorized it

635
00:27:12,025 --> 00:27:12,665
and, and

636
00:27:13,045 --> 00:27:13,574
this is

637
00:27:13,755 --> 00:27:14,324
useless.

638
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:16,655
There's no information here for me to make a decision.

639
00:27:16,665 --> 00:27:19,444
-- Yes,
-- it's a bad U I in that respect. I agree with that.

640
00:27:19,454 --> 00:27:23,094
-- I suspect they're going to fix it after this particular event.
-- I would hope so.

641
00:27:23,104 --> 00:27:23,984
I mean, because I would go,

642
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:24,714
I mean,

643
00:27:24,984 --> 00:27:27,555
yeah, that would definitely go a long way to helping people

644
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,680
and, and this is part of it again, is

645
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:33,569
security is hard. It's easy to screw it up.

646
00:27:33,699 --> 00:27:36,449
Google responded quickly, which was great.

647
00:27:36,619 --> 00:27:39,770
And now as long as they do something about this and they,

648
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,010
they make some change to fix it.

649
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,780
I would say this was a

650
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,449
successful event

651
00:27:45,824 --> 00:27:46,864
-- for the powers of
-- good.

652
00:27:46,935 --> 00:27:49,114
And here's my biggest concern though is Google will

653
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,765
most likely make some changes and do some real,

654
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:54,275
I'm guessing that they'll do some public facing stuff we know about.

655
00:27:54,285 --> 00:27:56,114
And I'm also guessing they're going to do some stuff in the background.

656
00:27:56,974 --> 00:27:59,604
You know, I would assume that they're smart enough to be like, hey, you know,

657
00:27:59,614 --> 00:28:01,714
we know a little bit about machine learning and domains.

658
00:28:01,724 --> 00:28:02,994
Maybe we should sort of like,

659
00:28:03,255 --> 00:28:06,844
yeah, like you said, add a hoop for people requesting full access and, you know,

660
00:28:07,015 --> 00:28:08,555
compare that to,

661
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:09,069
you know,

662
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:11,969
people who close their accounts or complained about being hacked or whatever.

663
00:28:12,229 --> 00:28:14,329
But my concern is that Google will do something about it.

664
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:16,500
But all these other places I'm apparently o off

665
00:28:16,689 --> 00:28:18,030
against won't,

666
00:28:18,819 --> 00:28:19,969
it doesn't matter with all

667
00:28:20,109 --> 00:28:21,180
-- up though
-- because

668
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,310
for example, Twitter or Facebook

669
00:28:23,439 --> 00:28:24,560
-- or
-- those guys,

670
00:28:27,729 --> 00:28:30,920
I guess here's part of it too though. Those guys are pretty smart cookies.

671
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:31,680
I'm

672
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:35,319
the number of sites that use Twitter to authenticate and then

673
00:28:35,329 --> 00:28:38,369
want full access to send and receive tweets on my behalf.

674
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:42,280
-- I'm like,
-- no, I have never, although I never use Twitter to authenticate,

675
00:28:42,449 --> 00:28:46,160
I will, I will set up AAA different account

676
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,209
before I would use Twitter. I use Google

677
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:52,180
or I create crappy passwords

678
00:28:52,729 --> 00:28:57,099
using the password manager but I, I refuse to use Facebook or Twitter

679
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,060
to do any sort of,

680
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,339
well, I guess part of it too though is every time I've tried, like you said, they,

681
00:29:02,349 --> 00:29:04,930
they, they ask for too much and I think that's why,

682
00:29:04,939 --> 00:29:07,939
where Google seems like they've got it figured out of, like, email only.

683
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,209
Yeah. And I'm ok with that.

684
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,819
What do you mean email address only? Not actual?

685
00:29:13,329 --> 00:29:15,579
Right. Right. Exactly. Like who am I?

686
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:19,380
So, which they're gonna know anyway, if I register a regular account with them,

687
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,500
here's a thought for Google. If you're listening,

688
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,520
uh by default, give them access to whatever they want.

689
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:27,040
The Google Docs, the gmail, the whole contacts thing,

690
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:28,920
but make it like a fake sandboxed one

691
00:29:28,989 --> 00:29:31,660
until the user explicitly gives them real access.

692
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,650
That could be interesting to actually,

693
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,890
that's kind of how Android permissions work.

694
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,380
Now is you install an app

695
00:29:37,739 --> 00:29:41,709
and then the first time it wants to say, like, use your camera, it'll say, you know,

696
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:44,869
the blah, blah, blah app wants access to your camera, allow, deny

697
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:47,979
and, and the various permissions and.

698
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:50,380
Right. Right. Which, which does work well.

699
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:53,180
And it would be really interesting too if they would tell you

700
00:29:53,189 --> 00:29:57,260
what particular linked things and what they're accessing and what they're doing,

701
00:29:57,349 --> 00:29:58,500
that would be probably

702
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,099
the other advantage would be is it wouldn't automatically break all these apps,

703
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,630
you know, some of them are legitimately useful.

704
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:05,459
Yeah.

705
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:06,239
Yeah, we can.

706
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:06,859
Well,

707
00:30:06,869 --> 00:30:08,989
I question if any of the ones that can read

708
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,699
and send email on my behalf are technically useful.

709
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,739
I did,

710
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:16,130
I did use one for a little while that allowed you to interact with PDF S in

711
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:20,060
-- a way that Google Docs itself did not support and
-- that needed access to your email.

712
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:21,119
No, it needed

713
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:21,329
access

714
00:30:21,449 --> 00:30:21,599
to my

715
00:30:21,739 --> 00:30:21,810
Google.

716
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:22,750
I get

717
00:30:23,109 --> 00:30:24,329
that. That's fine. That's fine.

718
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:24,569
You

719
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:24,780
know,

720
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:26,310
and the other one I've seen,

721
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:29,260
like I said is a spelling and grammar checker thing that helps you.

722
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:30,579
Uh just write

723
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,770
better emails, better papers, better, whatever

724
00:30:33,939 --> 00:30:34,189
I heard

725
00:30:34,329 --> 00:30:37,859
this, you know, I see, I keep seeing ads for on youtube which makes me, you know,

726
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:39,810
wonder why I'm being targeted for this.

727
00:30:39,819 --> 00:30:41,130
Do I not speak good English?

728
00:30:41,619 --> 00:30:41,939
Um

729
00:30:42,089 --> 00:30:42,420
No, you

730
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:43,569
don't write well.

731
00:30:45,939 --> 00:30:49,069
So I actually got a targeted dad the other day that actually applies to me.

732
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:51,770
It was for goldfish crackers which my kids eat a ton of man.

733
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,930
Every kid eats a ton of goldfish crackers.

734
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,810
And I bet under, under your car seats, I bet you have,

735
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:57,189
I

736
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:57,420
have to

737
00:30:58,890 --> 00:30:59,520
goldfish,

738
00:31:00,329 --> 00:31:02,050
I vacuum it out every two months because they,

739
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,050
they eat goldfish crackers in the car and it's just,

740
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:05,849
they do vacuum up nicely.

741
00:31:05,859 --> 00:31:08,959
They, they're until they get crushed and ground into the carpet.

742
00:31:09,459 --> 00:31:11,030
Which, but anyway, anyway,

743
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,880
-- you know,
-- go back to this. I mean that this is the thing, right? Is

744
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:17,250
I, I guess really we have really two big problems here.

745
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:22,520
One is, you know, oh, it says it's Google or Apple or support or my it guy.

746
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,979
Sure. Right. That must be legit.

747
00:31:24,989 --> 00:31:27,989
And there's no real easy way to tell actually who it is.

748
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,709
-- Right.
-- And so they're riding on the coattails of like Google's authenticity.

749
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:33,680
Right.

750
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,290
And I think that was kind of,

751
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:40,400
the intent always was we assumed Google was doing something there,

752
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:43,680
which they either aren't or there's some sort of loophole.

753
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:47,310
Yeah. And then that second, um, problem is just,

754
00:31:48,189 --> 00:31:48,810
you know,

755
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,609
generally speaking,

756
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:53,430
if we make permissions fine grained people end up turning them

757
00:31:53,439 --> 00:31:56,369
all on anyways because they just want stuff to work.

758
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,099
So a lot of places like this, you know, defaults to do,

759
00:31:59,109 --> 00:32:02,189
you want to give it access to your email and it's like, boom all of your email,

760
00:32:02,469 --> 00:32:06,310
like not just your inbox but like the whole thing or same thing with docs.

761
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:07,790
It's like all of your docs, not just

762
00:32:07,969 --> 00:32:09,699
you remember back in the day where you had

763
00:32:09,709 --> 00:32:12,689
a shell account and you had your public underscore html

764
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,709
directory and if you put stuff in there, it would now show up on the web server, right?

765
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:18,050
You know.

766
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,810
Uh and, and that actually worked pretty well for a while. Um

767
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,949
So, you know, something like that where for example, maybe, yeah, like I said,

768
00:32:25,959 --> 00:32:28,359
it adds a fake user or it kind of adds like a

769
00:32:28,469 --> 00:32:32,339
folder that you can like share the stuff into so that one app can access, you

770
00:32:32,439 --> 00:32:35,579
-- know what it
-- means. Like you're talking about a lot of complexity.

771
00:32:35,939 --> 00:32:36,469
Well, exactly.

772
00:32:36,479 --> 00:32:40,060
And that's why it won't work for 99% of people and only work for you and me.

773
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:43,380
And then one day we'll get tired of it and just turn it off or enable it for everything.

774
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:47,329
See, that's the problem. Right. With that, those complex permissions.

775
00:32:47,939 --> 00:32:48,489
Yes,

776
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:50,369
they become

777
00:32:50,579 --> 00:32:52,020
painful to administer.

778
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:52,760
and,

779
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:58,810
and if I had to guess Google is going to solve this on their end with some Google magic

780
00:32:59,189 --> 00:33:01,890
because we can't rely on people to do it. Right.

781
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,579
Well, even if people do it right.

782
00:33:04,589 --> 00:33:08,780
99.9% of the time assuming Google has about a billion users. Which,

783
00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:10,859
-- that's
-- true with the law of large numbers,

784
00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:14,420
every insane thing possible does happen all of the time.

785
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:15,510
Yeah.

786
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,869
I mean, the reality is somebody's going to be sleep deprived enough to not realize

787
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,020
or just

788
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,650
not a computer person.

789
00:33:22,689 --> 00:33:26,270
Oh, it's funny. So, yesterday I had some, uh, I got some new headshots taken,

790
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:28,650
you know, from my website and whatnot.

791
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:31,550
Like my linkedin profile because basically my, my current headshots are,

792
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,229
are old enough that I have hair in them.

793
00:33:33,729 --> 00:33:34,329
Um,

794
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,770
and, and also I've had people go, who is that?

795
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:41,560
Um, but anyway, so the guy is, you know,

796
00:33:41,569 --> 00:33:43,060
obviously we're chit chat and he's asking me what

797
00:33:43,069 --> 00:33:44,239
I do and it's computers here and he's like,

798
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,390
oh, I got a question for you

799
00:33:45,739 --> 00:33:49,430
and basically too long didn't read a friend

800
00:33:49,699 --> 00:33:53,050
of a friend, had a spouse or whatever. Die

801
00:33:53,229 --> 00:33:57,329
computer has a password. Computer also has photos on it. What can we do about that?

802
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:00,339
And so I explained about, you know, getting one of those, uh, bootle

803
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,489
C DS to reset the password and windows. And

804
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:05,630
I'm assuming that their hard drive is not encrypted because, you know,

805
00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:09,899
they're not a super savvy person. So this should actually be relatively easy to do.

806
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:12,989
And if that doesn't work, you know, just pop the hard drive out, put it in a caddy,

807
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,790
plug it into your machine and, like,

808
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,429
go hunting for photos,

809
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,188
you know.

810
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:21,429
But, and it was like, it really does boil down to, you know, that like,

811
00:34:21,438 --> 00:34:23,030
sort of normal people, like,

812
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:27,688
on the one hand, I, you know, I wish everybody would encrypt their hard drives,

813
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:31,870
but on the other hand, I really, it's gonna, you know, for your,

814
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:35,708
for the survivors of when that person dies and takes the password with them,

815
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,620
it's gonna suck,

816
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,879
you know, because how many people have, like, say their passwords

817
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:43,600
written down in a way that somebody else can get access to and keeps them up to date.

818
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,179
Most people don't.

819
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:46,719
Exactly. You know.

820
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,418
No, no, I, I'm very familiar with this problem.

821
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:49,958
Right.

822
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:52,889
-- So,
-- part of me wants people to have better security encrypted devices,

823
00:34:52,899 --> 00:34:54,030
like encrypted phones and stuff.

824
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,820
But at the same time, you know, now we're getting to that

825
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:58,520
more common case of like, oh, you know, my son died,

826
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,479
I'd like to get access to the photos on his iphone,

827
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,780
which then also raises the question of, you know, maybe he doesn't want,

828
00:35:03,939 --> 00:35:06,860
maybe he doesn't want people to have access to those photos. You know

829
00:35:07,459 --> 00:35:08,850
what this reminds me of always is,

830
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:13,139
is the jokes you see on things like reddit where people joke about,

831
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:15,679
you know, delete my browsing history when I die.

832
00:35:17,459 --> 00:35:19,889
But of course, as a security person, my first thought is, well,

833
00:35:19,899 --> 00:35:22,070
why aren't you just using an incognito browser?

834
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,729
You idiot.

835
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,610
It's a funny joke. And I totally understand what you're saying.

836
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:31,360
Yeah. Well, see, that's one of the biggest problems is right is when something asks

837
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,520
for permission to do something,

838
00:35:34,169 --> 00:35:36,989
we don't know necessarily what the intent is.

839
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,419
-- Uh
-- if you don't, then,

840
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:43,949
then you deny permission because if you don't know what the intent is,

841
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:45,939
why are you even doing that thing in the first place?

842
00:35:46,709 --> 00:35:47,449
Well, because you know,

843
00:35:47,459 --> 00:35:51,370
-- this unroll me thing says it would get rid of all my spam email,
-- right?

844
00:35:51,379 --> 00:35:53,449
And, and in that case, I think

845
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:56,409
the you understood the intent.

846
00:35:56,699 --> 00:36:00,850
It's then there was a misuse of trust on the part of enroll me

847
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,770
and, and things like that are also going to happen and,

848
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,820
and even I'm sure Google is guilty of this to a degree.

849
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:10,600
But in, in those cases, you just have to deal with them on a case by case basis.

850
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:11,489
Because, I mean, if,

851
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,810
if you pretend you're a paranoid nut all the time you end up like us.

852
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,570
-- Right. Yeah,
-- exactly.

853
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,689
Unemployable outside a very niche.

854
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:19,250
Right.

855
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,520
-- And, and you get your own podcast someday. So,
-- yeah.

856
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,340
Yeah. And you anyways.

857
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:30,169
Yeah. No, it's, I, yeah, well, see what fundamentally boils down to me is,

858
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:32,330
it's a user interface issue,

859
00:36:33,669 --> 00:36:36,250
right? Like, really what it boils down to is is you're trying to

860
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:37,610
let me,

861
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:38,939
let me finish it.

862
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:42,219
It's the interface of the computer and the person.

863
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,959
And that's a tough problem.

864
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:45,679
Right?

865
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:48,810
I, I'm going to say that's an impossible problem.

866
00:36:48,929 --> 00:36:50,280
I think we,

867
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:55,600
we have never been able to design a system that people can't be easily fooled.

868
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,979
And even if you design a better interface,

869
00:36:57,989 --> 00:37:00,600
the bad guys are just going to design a better attack.

870
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:05,469
I think the only solution to this is to stop this kind of stuff on the back end.

871
00:37:05,479 --> 00:37:09,399
And when I say stop this stuff, I mean, stop 80% of it because you can't get it all.

872
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:14,550
And that's, that's basically the best we can hope for is as long as we can kind of,

873
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,300
you know, it's kind of like your disease analogy.

874
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:19,270
You always use, you know, we, we can't stop everyone from dying,

875
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,870
but we can stop most people from dying.

876
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:23,790
-- Well, for a while.
-- Hopefully.

877
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:24,639
Yeah,

878
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:29,310
it's uh no, I just know what I mean, in the sense of a U I issue is that there's,

879
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,689
it's really hard to display security

880
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:36,020
related information to people in a way that's really understandable.

881
00:37:36,189 --> 00:37:38,179
And I mean, a good counter example of it is roads,

882
00:37:38,439 --> 00:37:41,280
right, road signs, you know, a lot of thought went into those things,

883
00:37:41,419 --> 00:37:44,290
the colors, the shapes, you know, the all of that

884
00:37:44,459 --> 00:37:47,760
to make it clear, like, you know, this is a yield sign, this is a stop sign.

885
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:49,659
One of these is a strong suggestion.

886
00:37:49,669 --> 00:37:50,290
The other one is like,

887
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,550
you really better do this or else something bad is going to happen.

888
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:55,709
Sure.

889
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:58,550
You know, and I've never seen good.

890
00:37:59,129 --> 00:38:01,979
I mean, windows vista being a great example of that, you know, the,

891
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:05,750
with the user access controls, like those constant pop up warnings.

892
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,120
Yeah, they were a great idea except then it, you know,

893
00:38:08,129 --> 00:38:10,060
you immediately went to alarm fatigue.

894
00:38:11,179 --> 00:38:14,399
Do you know, I talked to the guy who came up with that idea.

895
00:38:14,949 --> 00:38:18,439
This was a long time ago and like he said, as security people,

896
00:38:18,449 --> 00:38:20,239
we thought it was a great idea, right?

897
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:23,679
And then obviously it, it turned out to be a terrible mistake

898
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:28,090
and, and I, I guess this is part of our challenge as well,

899
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,459
is security people often think something is

900
00:38:30,469 --> 00:38:33,239
a great idea and normal people disagree.

901
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:37,800
Well, even security people, the part of it is this idea

902
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:41,260
seems great on paper and it looks great if you do it. For one or two days.

903
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:43,290
But if you have to use it for like 10 years,

904
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,719
you know, you're going to want to murder somebody by the end of those 10 years.

905
00:38:46,729 --> 00:38:47,959
That's also true.

906
00:38:48,929 --> 00:38:52,959
Firewalls. Great idea. Except now we all just poke a hole for port

907
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,120
443

908
00:38:54,419 --> 00:38:55,580
and maybe port 80.

909
00:38:55,889 --> 00:38:56,080
Uh

910
00:38:56,889 --> 00:39:00,219
Sure, I think firewalls are fairly successful.

911
00:39:00,229 --> 00:39:02,560
But I think the reason for that is we made them usable.

912
00:39:02,989 --> 00:39:06,439
The majority of places I've seen using firewalls don't actually have that

913
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:11,100
detailed or tight rule sets outside of where they're like using a subscription to.

914
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,800
Like, here's a list of a sites block them,

915
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:13,780
you know,

916
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:18,169
and so it's, they've, they've sort of outsourced that piece and, you know,

917
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:21,540
and this is something where like this is something I've never seen is like, you know,

918
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:25,260
some sort of registry or review site for like, you know, here's these o

919
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:26,129
off sites

920
00:39:26,379 --> 00:39:29,290
which ones are trustworthy and which ones are not like, for example,

921
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,129
looking in my thing.

922
00:39:30,139 --> 00:39:32,860
Well, some of these are apps. So right off the bat that gets a bit complicated.

923
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,500
But some of them, you know, like, for example,

924
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:38,379
disgust.com wants basic access to my account info clearly.

925
00:39:38,389 --> 00:39:39,120
That's ok.

926
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:42,530
Right. It's, it's the online comments and it just wants to know who I am. Sure.

927
00:39:42,919 --> 00:39:44,469
So like five out of five stars, a

928
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:46,489
green thumbs up or whatever, you know,

929
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:49,310
same for feed, le same for medium,

930
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,370
you know. But then there's like these other apps where it's like, you know,

931
00:39:52,929 --> 00:39:54,189
uh, because I've often wondered, like,

932
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:56,209
are people trying to maybe use this to harvest

933
00:39:56,629 --> 00:39:57,600
account names?

934
00:39:58,250 --> 00:39:58,679
It

935
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,899
maybe, I, I doubt it.

936
00:40:00,909 --> 00:40:02,409
-- I think
-- that, I don't think it's worth it,

937
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,270
but it's probably not, it's,

938
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,310
it's way easier to just write a worm

939
00:40:06,469 --> 00:40:09,550
that handles everybody in your contact list.

940
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:13,639
Yeah. And even that seems like, seriously, like,

941
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:18,580
I mean, it's a good way to get valid emails and the relationship of the, you know,

942
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,469
what actually would be maybe even more better there.

943
00:40:20,479 --> 00:40:22,399
Is, is it more better? Terrible? Sorry.

944
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:26,590
Um, what's more interesting to me there is that not only with the contact listing,

945
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,379
do you get

946
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,820
the names of these people

947
00:40:29,189 --> 00:40:32,729
but kind of who you should send the email is being from,

948
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,199
to get a higher response rate?

949
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:39,199
Well, and not only that because they had full access to people's gmail,

950
00:40:39,209 --> 00:40:41,560
they could legitimately send it as that person.

951
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:45,159
Like, not even, not even Joe Job send, like, for real, send

952
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:46,000
the email.

953
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,800
Oh, yeah. No, I, I, yeah, like I,

954
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,399
yeah, that, that's actually,

955
00:40:51,379 --> 00:40:53,350
I don't know what would have happened if they've gotten away with that.

956
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,129
Well, they,

957
00:40:54,489 --> 00:40:57,810
they wouldn't have and, and so this is what makes me think about.

958
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:02,760
There's really two scenarios I can see that are plausible is, first of all,

959
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:07,840
it was just some, like dumb kid, which is what the suggestion currently is that,

960
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:09,040
that made a mistake

961
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,560
and didn't realize what was going to happen. Right.

962
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:15,139
The alternative is somebody made a mistake and this was meant to be

963
00:41:15,149 --> 00:41:18,689
a targeted attack to maybe go two or three levels deep on somebody

964
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:22,310
in terms of email contacts and it exploded and went too deep.

965
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:24,520
And I, I don't know,

966
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:25,820
basically,

967
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,330
sure

968
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,969
it had to check to see if the system was already infected,

969
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:30,949
but

970
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:34,129
it only checked like one in 10 times or whatever and clearly, that's

971
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:35,729
right. And that's fair.

972
00:41:35,889 --> 00:41:36,290
Uh

973
00:41:37,129 --> 00:41:41,120
This is a tough one to call because I can see

974
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:42,570
two,

975
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:47,649
well, those 22 options where it's either mistake or, or clearly malicious.

976
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:51,770
Here's the thing I don't get if it was clearly malicious in a targeted attack,

977
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,260
don't you think they would have set up like a couple

978
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:56,149
dozen Gmail accounts with various contacts and tried it out there

979
00:41:57,659 --> 00:42:00,550
or is that just too much hassle for QE? And you just fired off?

980
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,209
Well, it can be a simple bug too

981
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:03,959
where

982
00:42:04,129 --> 00:42:08,979
it was, that was not the intent. And I don't know how this was actually triggered

983
00:42:09,479 --> 00:42:13,229
where obviously there was some sort of command and control system somewhere,

984
00:42:13,629 --> 00:42:16,909
right? That was essentially making the magic happen.

985
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,820
And, and I don't understand what, what went on with that either.

986
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:21,580
And it could be a lot of things. I mean,

987
00:42:21,929 --> 00:42:22,760
in addition, they use

988
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,500
Meiner, which is

989
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,939
relatively uncontrolled. So,

990
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:29,459
and, and obviously, as happened,

991
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,219
Meiner found out and they shut down that account. So now you've lost your data. It

992
00:42:34,169 --> 00:42:34,850
honestly,

993
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:39,229
this smells like a mistake from someone who didn't really know what they were doing.

994
00:42:39,669 --> 00:42:40,570
But

995
00:42:40,739 --> 00:42:41,770
it, at the same time,

996
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:46,429
if I wanted to mount a really nice attack to harvest a bunch of contact information,

997
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:49,070
I'd make it look like a mistake.

998
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,270
You know what I mean?

999
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:54,189
Well, that's one thing I'm kind of wondering now is, are we like some of these, like,

1000
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:55,699
really widespread attacks?

1001
00:42:55,709 --> 00:42:57,389
Are they actually a targeted attack?

1002
00:42:57,399 --> 00:42:59,510
You know, hiding inside of that thundering herd?

1003
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:00,639
I,

1004
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:06,110
I mean, look, you can put on the tinfoil hat and, and make any claim you want.

1005
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:11,310
I think that's a plausible thing to think about, but it, it's not helpful either.

1006
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:12,340
Yeah,

1007
00:43:12,959 --> 00:43:16,979
it's tricky man. Welcome to the, welcome to the future we deserve. Right.

1008
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:19,850
I think really a lot of this,

1009
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:22,189
what it boils down to is having those offline backups and

1010
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:24,719
having those audit logs that can't be modified or new.

1011
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,250
Yeah. But in this case, who cares that that wouldn't have helped either?

1012
00:43:28,649 --> 00:43:31,709
Well, no, no, no, but at least you can sort of clean up after the fact and

1013
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:31,860
I

1014
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:32,419
get

1015
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:32,639
it

1016
00:43:33,419 --> 00:43:35,770
so that, you know, the attack doesn't stay in

1017
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:38,250
assuming they had

1018
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,760
modified data.

1019
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,280
Well, they don't have to have modified data, right.

1020
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:45,409
They just the fact that they still have access to your account six months from now.

1021
00:43:45,419 --> 00:43:48,719
Now I'm assuming Google is smart enough to have nuked everybody's, you know,

1022
00:43:49,229 --> 00:43:50,969
trust relationship with that entity.

1023
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,020
That's, that's happened.

1024
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:59,159
And my understanding is they cleaned it up for anyone who is linked to that provider.

1025
00:43:59,620 --> 00:43:59,949
I mean,

1026
00:43:59,959 --> 00:44:02,540
the thing that gets me really is I don't have to kind

1027
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:05,709
of worry about what happened because I do have these off like,

1028
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:06,110
well,

1029
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,340
effectively offline backups in the sense of Google just has a

1030
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:12,510
whole bunch of magic going on with this Google vault stuff.

1031
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,239
And I can like,

1032
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:13,760
you know,

1033
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:17,810
if somebody were to ever come to me and say what exactly what happened on my domain,

1034
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:20,689
at least I'd be like, well, let me check and I'll tell you, you know, and as a,

1035
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:21,879
as a company

1036
00:44:22,139 --> 00:44:25,590
that level of sort of like what actually, how bad was this? What actually happened?

1037
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,580
Oh, we just lost, you know, the contact list. Ok. Well, it's not great.

1038
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:29,780
-- But
-- see,

1039
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:31,899
and I think that's exactly the point we

1040
00:44:31,909 --> 00:44:35,290
should end this conversation on is the concept that

1041
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:37,800
by leveraging someone like Google,

1042
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:42,969
they have immense resources in terms of security people and

1043
00:44:42,979 --> 00:44:46,840
storage and operations and just everything across the board.

1044
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:47,610
And so

1045
00:44:47,939 --> 00:44:49,919
even though there might be hiccups here and there,

1046
00:44:50,659 --> 00:44:56,600
if this had happened to basically any self hosted organization on the planet,

1047
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:57,840
it would have taken

1048
00:44:58,229 --> 00:45:00,629
more than an hour. Well, it wasn't a Friday. It was.

1049
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:01,280
Yeah. Yeah.

1050
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:04,149
But I mean, that's the thing if it happened on Christmas or a Friday or whatever.

1051
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:07,179
-- I mean, it would have been, especially any
-- day that occurred. I bet,

1052
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:11,560
I bet any other organization who wasn't one of these big guys, someone like Google,

1053
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:13,969
it would have taken a minimum of four hours to

1054
00:45:13,979 --> 00:45:15,409
figure out what was going on and to start,

1055
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:16,929
I would have guessed at least two days.

1056
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:18,689
-- It might even be days.
-- Four hours

1057
00:45:18,699 --> 00:45:21,679
is I'm going to be optimistic and generous.

1058
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:25,679
Well, to me in my mind, just to even get your head around the problem. Right.

1059
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:27,050
How many people truly understand o

1060
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:27,340
off

1061
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,780
for?

1062
00:45:29,219 --> 00:45:31,879
No, there's probably not a ton, there's enough.

1063
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:36,840
But I think, uh, just recognizing the attack, first of all is tricky and,

1064
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:40,479
and my guess is Google knew what was going on because in all seriousness

1065
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:43,639
in the like 20 minutes, I was dealing with this by the end,

1066
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:47,340
it was clear that things were under control already,

1067
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,639
which is awesome. Right. That's fantastic.

1068
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:50,500
And you figure I,

1069
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:54,000
I was helping out one person and it took me 20 minutes to figure all this out.

1070
00:45:54,199 --> 00:45:54,719
You know,

1071
00:45:55,189 --> 00:45:57,399
I wonder if this has happened before and we just never noticed.

1072
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:59,570
I guarantee it has,

1073
00:46:00,139 --> 00:46:05,350
but again, we can't fix everybody. We just have to fix most people. Right.

1074
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:06,639
Yeah.

1075
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:09,340
So anyway, any closing thoughts, Kurt,

1076
00:46:09,689 --> 00:46:11,239
yeah. Make sure you have audit logs

1077
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:15,820
and some way of gripping them or whatever so that if something does happen,

1078
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:17,790
because that's what gets me is a lot of organizations

1079
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,310
just wouldn't have taken a long time to respond.

1080
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,439
But, like they would have had to, you know,

1081
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:24,010
figured out where the data was that they need to look at.

1082
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:26,969
Yes, I'm also familiar with this problem.

1083
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:27,629
It is,

1084
00:46:27,639 --> 00:46:30,360
logging is tricky and it is certainly not an

1085
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,949
easy thing to do and it's becoming increasingly difficult

1086
00:46:33,219 --> 00:46:37,379
as the amount of information we have is growing exponentially.

1087
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:41,189
-- But that's a topic for another day, I think. Yeah.
-- Yeah.

1088
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:41,830
Yeah.

1089
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:44,260
You know what really is interesting is, yeah,

1090
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:45,939
I don't think there's a single piece of useful

1091
00:46:45,949 --> 00:46:47,620
advice we can give people to avoid this attack.

1092
00:46:47,629 --> 00:46:50,570
There is nothing we can tell people which is what makes it so exciting.

1093
00:46:52,689 --> 00:46:54,699
I mean, the only thing I can think of is go through your oo

1094
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:57,909
providers like Twitter, Google linkedin, whatever

1095
00:46:58,209 --> 00:46:58,810
and, you know,

1096
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:01,840
hunt down whatever that link is to see what's connected

1097
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:04,199
to your account and maybe give it a quick once over

1098
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,570
that. That is. But again, that's all I

1099
00:47:06,679 --> 00:47:08,320
got too late at that point.

1100
00:47:08,919 --> 00:47:09,360
Yeah. Yeah,

1101
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:13,459
it is. Again, this is why I'm so excited. This is like Christmas time, man.

1102
00:47:13,469 --> 00:47:15,600
This is basically a, a new

1103
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:17,719
attack. Not, I shouldn't say that

1104
00:47:17,929 --> 00:47:18,969
we've known about it.

1105
00:47:19,659 --> 00:47:23,520
We've known about it, but we haven't seen it, like, legitimately exercised

1106
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:25,439
in a large scale manner.

1107
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:26,030
So

1108
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:28,330
I wonder if this is the new exercise for web.

1109
00:47:29,239 --> 00:47:30,639
It very well could be.

1110
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:33,780
I don't know because, I mean,

1111
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:36,229
people do put their banking details in their Google docs

1112
00:47:36,389 --> 00:47:38,459
and password resets if you have access to their email.

1113
00:47:38,469 --> 00:47:41,699
This is actually extra interesting because I've heard people talk about before

1114
00:47:41,709 --> 00:47:44,709
about putting a Google spreadsheet together with all your passwords in it.

1115
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:44,879
That,

1116
00:47:45,179 --> 00:47:46,580
that's probably bad.

1117
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:49,010
It's, well, it's, it's

1118
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:51,939
probably less worse than having it

1119
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,939
on your desktop. But

1120
00:47:54,429 --> 00:47:56,090
fundamentally, I mean,

1121
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,560
you know that, well, yeah, it's,

1122
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:01,860
it's probably better to use a password specific storage mechanism,

1123
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:04,550
you know, than a spreadsheet.

1124
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:05,969
Um, because you can't

1125
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:09,459
encrypt or password protect specific spreadsheets in Google docs, I don't think.

1126
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:10,659
No, no, you can't.

1127
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,500
So, all right, man, it's time.

1128
00:48:13,229 --> 00:48:13,530
Thank you.

1129
00:48:15,129 --> 00:48:15,659
I'll put up,

1130
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:16,439
uh, well,

1131
00:48:16,449 --> 00:48:20,239
I was just gonna say we'll put up a list of uh those links to where you can access your,

1132
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:22,060
uh, what's accessing your account,

1133
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:23,409
I guess on those major

1134
00:48:23,629 --> 00:48:26,889
providers. So you can double check them. So go to the website for that.

1135
00:48:27,389 --> 00:48:30,060
And, and what, what is the website, Kurt,

1136
00:48:30,459 --> 00:48:31,209
uh, open

1137
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:33,189
-- source security podcast dot
-- com. That's right.

1138
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:35,239
I, I don't think that's the first time you ever said that.

1139
00:48:35,389 --> 00:48:35,989
So,

1140
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:38,429
on the show. So, anyway. All right. Thank you, Kurt.

1141
00:48:38,439 --> 00:48:41,409
Thank you, everybody for listening. It was fun as Kurt said, open

1142
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:43,760
source Security podcast.com where you can find the show notes.

1143
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:47,389
We have links to Twitter, we have a Pound Os S podcast.

1144
00:48:47,399 --> 00:48:50,399
Hashtag you can use to get a hold of Kurt and myself.

1145
00:48:50,439 --> 00:48:52,280
We have a Facebook group that we monitor,

1146
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:55,389
you can handle us there if you want to and otherwise, uh, Kurt,

1147
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:57,520
you have a fabulous rest of your day.

1148
00:48:58,199 --> 00:49:01,379
-- Yeah, I hope everybody's enjoying spring.
-- That's right. Stay safe.

1149
00:49:01,389 --> 00:49:03,659
Everybody don't, don't be clicking on those emails.
