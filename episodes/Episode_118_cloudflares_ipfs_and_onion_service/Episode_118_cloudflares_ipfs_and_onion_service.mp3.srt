Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 118 with myself,

1
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:10,939
Kurt Siefried

2
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:13,189
and my partner in Thought Crime Josh Pressers.

3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,590
So I'm starting to feel like I might be getting

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,729
sick and I don't know if that's just like,

5
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:20,059
like some sort of Stockholm Syndrome from talking to

6
00:00:20,069 --> 00:00:22,530
you too much or if I'm legitimately becoming ill,

7
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,280
probably there's, there's been,

8
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,040
there's been two really nasty colds going around locally.

9
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:31,690
-- Yeah,
-- I know some people who are basically bedridden from catching whatever the,

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,769
the plague that's traversing the globe.

11
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:38,028
-- Is that the one with the puking?
-- I, I didn't ask for that level of detail, but

12
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:40,909
we'll see. Maybe.

13
00:00:41,278 --> 00:00:41,958
Right. That's

14
00:00:42,168 --> 00:00:47,589
when, when people tell me they're sick, that's not on my list of things. I, I ask them

15
00:00:48,278 --> 00:00:51,499
no, social distancing works for preventing the spread of plagues and, you know,

16
00:00:51,508 --> 00:00:53,368
the first week or two of school and

17
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:54,569
voila

18
00:00:54,749 --> 00:00:55,469
the freshman

19
00:00:55,699 --> 00:00:56,109
off.

20
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,040
That's right. That's right.

21
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:02,529
And, and thank goodness for airplanes now.

22
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,449
So the whole world can enjoy disease at the same time.

23
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:07,489
It's fantastic. Yeah.

24
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,089
Every time I travel there's somebody on the

25
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:10,900
plane sneezing or coughing and it's just like.

26
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:15,669
-- That's wonderful.
-- Yeah, seriously, man. I, I have a very large event in Europe.

27
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,089
I'm attending in a couple of weeks

28
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:18,309
and

29
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:20,860
I am completely confident I will,

30
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:25,180
I will leave with some sort of disease that somebody else brought with them.

31
00:01:25,199 --> 00:01:27,110
-- It's
-- great. Can I suggest?

32
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,279
Because this is something I'm trying to do is I'm trying to no longer shake hands at

33
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,230
conferences because it's just too many people and

34
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:35,029
probably most of them have good personal hygiene,

35
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,349
but

36
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:37,150
some of them probably don't,

37
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:42,540
I would assume none of them do. It's easier. It's kind of like, assume, compromise.

38
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:42,930
Right.

39
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:46,849
I just assume nobody washes their hands and

40
00:01:47,269 --> 00:01:50,970
I, I'm sensitive to what you say. But I, like, I'm a hands shaker

41
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:51,970
so I'm,

42
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,430
I'm probably never gonna not do that just because it's

43
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,980
something I do without even thinking about it and,

44
00:01:56,989 --> 00:01:58,730
and rather than trying to,

45
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,919
to be something I'm not, I just wash my hands a lot.

46
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,199
Maybe I should get some golfing gloves or something.

47
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:08,429
Well, you don't know. Something that won't make my hands too sweaty. Right.

48
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,990
You're not a big enough weirdo.

49
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,389
-- Put on some gloves.
-- Yeah.

50
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,660
Well, just, I know because, like,

51
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:18,350
you shake somebody's hand and it's like moist and it's just like, oh,

52
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,270
-- nice.
-- Right. Where is that hand been?

53
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:21,649
Yeah.

54
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:22,259
Then you use

55
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,050
alcohol wipes.

56
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:29,339
-- Oh dear.
-- Just whatever it, it, and part of it as well is I view this as

57
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,300
the more disease I acquire when I'm younger.

58
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:32,830
Hopefully,

59
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:38,220
when I'm much older I will have some level of immunity that might keep me not dead

60
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,360
for longer.

61
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,229
I think we're past the point of that working because

62
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,649
just there's so much stuff going around all the time.

63
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,820
-- Now, let
-- me, let me have this one.

64
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:47,270
Ok,

65
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,779
I'll give you this one. We'll pretend it's 18 hundreds.

66
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:51,979
Yes.

67
00:02:52,369 --> 00:02:54,869
That's right. You died of dysentery. You lose

68
00:02:59,029 --> 00:03:03,220
anyway. Anyway. So, let's talk about cloud flare today. They're up to some

69
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,240
stuff.

70
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,449
Yeah. Well, I mean, they're usually up to some pretty cool stuff and

71
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,250
that's true.

72
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:08,970
To be blunt,

73
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:11,080
you don't do boring things and get 10%

74
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:12,830
of the world's internet traffic coming through your,

75
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:13,669
they

76
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,759
-- only have 10% 10
-- percent.

77
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:16,229
Well, it's,

78
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,669
it's depending on how you measure it

79
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:20,639
volumetrically versus number of requests versus whatever.

80
00:03:20,649 --> 00:03:24,070
Right. So, like volumetrically, the majority of web traffic is video,

81
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,529
right? Like youtube

82
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,460
Netflix,

83
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,210
you know,

84
00:03:28,779 --> 00:03:31,610
no offense. But you watch one hour of Netflix at four K

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,410
and that's equivalent to like reading every single

86
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:38,250
-- text web page for the rest of your life.
-- Right.

87
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:38,800
You know.

88
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,929
Right. Right.

89
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:43,880
Um, so, yeah, when you look at, you know,

90
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:48,610
iii I don't think we can measure web traffic simply by raw volume of traffic because,

91
00:03:48,619 --> 00:03:50,440
yeah, all the video goes over it now.

92
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:52,009
So that kind of skews it a bit.

93
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,529
Um, number of requests is also a bit skewed because, you know,

94
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,729
just, you, you load a front page like cnn.com and it's got how many third party

95
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:00,419
things?

96
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,610
Like hundreds,

97
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,759
-- probably hundreds now. It's,
-- it's a lot.

98
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,169
Um Like, I'm just looking at, oh, wow.

99
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:17,640
Adblock plus 3403. Let's see. What's this other one blocking doing? It's uh 3499.

100
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,108
Uh Where's the other one?

101
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:24,029
Wait, this is how much crap is being blocked from cnn.com? No, no, no.

102
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,459
This is in total, like, since I've opened my browser right

103
00:04:26,609 --> 00:04:26,630
now

104
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:31,390
and I use a youtube ad blocker. Holy jeez. And it says

105
00:04:31,679 --> 00:04:36,709
total ads blocked 9972 total time, save two hours, 26 minutes, 27 seconds. And to

106
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,899
keep that in context, that's with like you only having to watch, I think,

107
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,309
what is it like three or five seconds of the ad and then you can skip it.

108
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:43,920
It, it depends.

109
00:04:43,929 --> 00:04:49,149
So I actually don't block youtube ads on purpose because I feel like it's

110
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,350
altruistic of me to make sure the content creators are getting their ad revenue

111
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,920
and it's super annoying and there are more and more

112
00:04:57,929 --> 00:05:01,119
unskippable 15 2nd ads lately it feels like and,

113
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,709
and I don't know if,

114
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:07,480
if everyone sees that or maybe they just decided I'm a sucker or something, but it's,

115
00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:07,950
it's,

116
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,799
it's on all my mobile devices.

117
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,929
I don't have good ad blocking for youtube and II,

118
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,959
I personally cannot watch youtube videos on my ipad anymore.

119
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:16,040
It's just too annoying.

120
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,489
Um, my kids still watch youtube videos, obviously,

121
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,399
but they're like banging away at that skip ad button as soon as it pops up.

122
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,290
I also feel like it's a gentle reminder

123
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:28,200
from the universe to quit watching youtube and go

124
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:28,790
do something

125
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,109
-- else.
-- This is true.

126
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:31,959
This is hard to argue.

127
00:05:32,154 --> 00:05:36,774
I tell you that as well because I know when I had no ads on youtube, it often be,

128
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:40,095
I'd start watching, you know, a video on, on security

129
00:05:40,355 --> 00:05:42,524
and then I'd end up watching something about, you know,

130
00:05:42,535 --> 00:05:44,535
like carving a duck out of a potato.

131
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,855
It's like, what, what have I done with my life for the last two hours?

132
00:05:48,234 --> 00:05:51,054
So this way when like some horrible political ad pops up,

133
00:05:51,065 --> 00:05:53,804
it shakes me out of my trance and I think, oh, crap.

134
00:05:53,885 --> 00:05:57,665
-- Well,
-- it's like the Netflix Shame Screen. Are you still watching? It's like, yes.

135
00:05:58,135 --> 00:05:58,304
Yes,

136
00:05:58,404 --> 00:05:58,834
I am.

137
00:05:58,934 --> 00:05:59,214
Yes.

138
00:05:59,385 --> 00:06:00,725
Stop judging me

139
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,170
actually.

140
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:03,790
You know what, you know how I get around that is,

141
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:05,899
I always make sure I click the button instead

142
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,769
of letting it time out to the next episode.

143
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,820
And I'm also too impatient to wait the 13 seconds.

144
00:06:10,929 --> 00:06:11,140
-- Are
-- you

145
00:06:11,299 --> 00:06:11,510
one of those

146
00:06:12,179 --> 00:06:13,329
people that takes, like,

147
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:16,450
stops the microwave and takes your food out with like one second to go.

148
00:06:16,619 --> 00:06:17,450
I,

149
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:20,630
if I'm standing near it. Yes, because then it doesn't,

150
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,679
it doesn't beat through

151
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,880
times. It annoys me. I hate three beeps. I don't need three beeps

152
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:25,269
once

153
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,489
one beep is enough.

154
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,649
I want a setting on my microwave that says don't beep three times three is too many

155
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:32,149
anyway.

156
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:35,160
Yeah.

157
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:35,350
So

158
00:06:35,869 --> 00:06:38,619
basically the thing with cloud floor has, uh,

159
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,809
rather cleverly is they found a business model

160
00:06:42,329 --> 00:06:48,339
where the people using cloud flare for free added value to cloud flare, both

161
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,579
for the users and for cloud flare. Right.

162
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,480
Um, and it reminds me of, I don't know, this is going way back in the day,

163
00:06:55,489 --> 00:06:57,750
but security focus.com way back in the day

164
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:00,890
acquired this start up, whatever that was basically,

165
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,869
they would take your firewall logs for free process

166
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,750
them and give you like a really pretty dashboard.

167
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,859
And when I say a really pretty dashboard, I'm talking about 1520 years ago

168
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,290
where nowadays if you looked at that dashboard,

169
00:07:11,299 --> 00:07:13,730
you would cry because it's so terrible, right?

170
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:15,670
But back in the day that was all we had

171
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,089
and, and, and well to digress for a second,

172
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,059
but I never really understood what the point of that dashboard was because action

173
00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:22,890
speaking, what are you going to do with it? Right.

174
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,220
But anyways

175
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,059
and,

176
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,019
and so much like that people would get their firewall logs going through the system,

177
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:30,190
they'd get their pretty dashboard, they show it to their boss, whatever,

178
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,070
everybody's happy.

179
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:33,799
But what this it allowed security focus to do

180
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:38,709
was to aggregate a whole big pile of essentially sensor data from the internet.

181
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,190
And so they could track things like internet worms and viruses going around,

182
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:44,119
you know, based on like, oh you know,

183
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:50,040
port 4321 is like getting super active starting in China now it's spreading to,

184
00:07:50,049 --> 00:07:52,799
you know, Asia and oh, we, now we're seeing it in North America

185
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,220
and to build that sensor network obviously would be horrendously expensive,

186
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:57,390
you know.

187
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,200
So getting

188
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,209
we're, we're,

189
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:03,200
we've really strongly established. I think economically speaking data is

190
00:08:03,309 --> 00:08:07,739
potentially very valuable and you can extract a lot of value from it as a company.

191
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:10,040
And you know, and,

192
00:08:10,049 --> 00:08:13,070
and that to some degree is what cloud flare did by hosting

193
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:15,720
people's sites because part of it too is the marginal cost,

194
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:15,950
right?

195
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,910
Once they've built this system and have, you know,

196
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,470
a couple dozen points of presence around the globe and have it all working,

197
00:08:21,619 --> 00:08:21,839
you know,

198
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,799
the incremental cost of adding a few million

199
00:08:23,809 --> 00:08:26,739
websites that honestly like my website only see

200
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:31,459
kind of like 100,000 hits a month or something like which in today's terms is nothing

201
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:35,840
is like so close to zero as to effectively be zero.

202
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:36,719
You know,

203
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:40,808
like one gmail account is the cost of Google hosting. That is,

204
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,739
yeah, it's, it's pennies

205
00:08:44,109 --> 00:08:45,380
and so

206
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,099
they've got all this traffic coming through their

207
00:08:48,109 --> 00:08:49,590
system and that's part of their thing is,

208
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:52,159
you know, how do they keep kind of getting

209
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,059
more traffic and growing? Right?

210
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,099
Because their existing customers obviously will hopefully

211
00:08:56,109 --> 00:08:57,140
be growing and getting more traffic.

212
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,000
But how do you acquire new customers? Right.

213
00:08:59,109 --> 00:09:03,340
You've already got free, you've already got free. Http S that was a big one, right?

214
00:09:03,349 --> 00:09:06,789
Like a lot of people. Oh, you know, I need to go to HTTP S,

215
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,270
oh, I just, I go to Cloud Flare for, for free.

216
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:12,580
Oh, that was easy. Click, click. Done. What, what's next?

217
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,909
Right. How do we, how do we make it better from here?

218
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,729
And clearly

219
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:20,630
IP FS Internet, what is it? Interplanetary file system?

220
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,270
Which is a great name.

221
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,400
Yeah, I wasn't, I was, at first I read that I was like,

222
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:26,309
are they doing something with the deep space network?

223
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,780
Like what?

224
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:29,380
That's the first thing I thought,

225
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:29,900
jeez,

226
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,270
we are

227
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,849
-- old men
-- and then I got sad to learn. They weren't.

228
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,840
Yeah, exactly.

229
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,960
So IP FS is,

230
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,320
as I understand it, the long and the short of it is

231
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,200
they run an IP FS gateway

232
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:45,169
that talks to an IP FS back end, which is this like file,

233
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:46,989
coin Blockchain thing anyways,

234
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:49,539
the long and the short of it is, is IP FS is

235
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:53,090
effectively, it's a Blockchain slash file system

236
00:09:53,299 --> 00:09:54,250
that stores data.

237
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,880
Um, so you store a document in it,

238
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:00,270
like a web page and the sort of name of that web page

239
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,210
is a hash value for that web page and they use multiple hashes,

240
00:10:04,219 --> 00:10:05,059
I think they said they use

241
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:07,559
sha 256 and something else. I forget what.

242
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:10,059
And so that's the

243
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,070
that big long fancy string is the

244
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:16,299
uh the the identifier of that web page. So

245
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,390
you go to an IP FS gateway slash the

246
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,150
site slash that identifier and you get that document.

247
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,580
So obviously you need like a, a bit of magic wrapped around it for, you know,

248
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,710
all the URL S and links to work and for people to be able to find things, right?

249
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,849
And people have, you know, they've written some tooling around that.

250
00:10:31,859 --> 00:10:35,469
So you can like, basically you can take a static capture of a website

251
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,440
and dump it into IP FS

252
00:10:38,109 --> 00:10:39,570
and you know,

253
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:41,969
all the links work and things like that, you know,

254
00:10:41,979 --> 00:10:45,130
things like search and stuff won't work unless you kind of rebuild it.

255
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:46,619
What this means is

256
00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:50,770
they are now strongly moving into the territory of,

257
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:54,979
you know, we're a carrier, we provide access to content,

258
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:57,400
we don't necessarily host that content ourselves

259
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,710
in the sense of

260
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,140
we may have a cache or a copy of that content,

261
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,969
but the actual back end hosting that content is not us, right?

262
00:11:05,979 --> 00:11:09,489
It's, it's on wordpress.com or it's on your personal web server or it's

263
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:11,330
whatever, right?

264
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,520
And this is something that they've been pushing for a long time, right?

265
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,289
Because they, they keep coming back to the whole,

266
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:20,750
like we basically don't boot anybody off unless they're like, truly,

267
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,299
you know, really violating our terms of service,

268
00:11:23,619 --> 00:11:28,090
right? And they did that once in the past um or at least once in the past that we know of.

269
00:11:28,099 --> 00:11:29,200
Right. Right. Right.

270
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:33,179
And so this IP FS what this does is it gives people a way

271
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:34,460
to

272
00:11:34,869 --> 00:11:39,140
host content in a way that is very hard to take down

273
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:42,299
because you basically have to get cloud flare to blacklist it,

274
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,330
but to actually get the back end taken down

275
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,809
is basically damn near impossible at this point.

276
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:51,460
Right. It sounds like the, the, the data can never be removed once you put it in

277
00:11:52,369 --> 00:11:52,750
and

278
00:11:53,469 --> 00:11:53,849
it's

279
00:11:53,969 --> 00:11:53,979
a

280
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:54,780
Blockchain.

281
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:55,239
That's the

282
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:55,369
whole

283
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:55,549
point.

284
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,609
It's a magic Blockchain though because like

285
00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:01,590
the Bitcoin Blockchain is hosted everywhere.

286
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:03,340
Whereas it sounds like this one,

287
00:12:03,669 --> 00:12:06,549
you will have a subset of data on a client.

288
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,390
Well, you would set up your own copy of this Blockchain with your own data,

289
00:12:11,489 --> 00:12:11,919
right?

290
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:12,919
Like

291
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,140
it's shared like you

292
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,820
-- control what you're sharing,
-- right?

293
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,179
Well, you could share,

294
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:22,429
you can run it privately or you can be part of the bigger one is my understanding,

295
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:22,640
right?

296
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:22,809
So

297
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,559
same thing could happen with Blockchain, right?

298
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:27,200
You can, you can effectively take a bunch of Bitcoins

299
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,099
for example, and do your own Bitcoin network now,

300
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:33,570
nobody would because the value of that smaller network is

301
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:35,640
much less than the large network.

302
00:12:35,849 --> 00:12:36,940
Yeah, but that's stupid.

303
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,940
There's, there's no point in that.

304
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,049
Exactly.

305
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,619
Um Whereas with this, with hosting your own files, you can now take your files,

306
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,440
shove them into this IP FS thing, you know your own copy of it or the global copy,

307
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,229
as I understand it

308
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:50,690
and then get it fronted on cloud flare.

309
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,820
Well, you can even, I mean,

310
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,380
you could host it yourself.

311
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,940
I mean, well, you put yourself in quotes where you,

312
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,580
you plug your own website into this.

313
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:03,010
And I guess so here's, here's what I'm wondering about this. I see

314
00:13:03,609 --> 00:13:05,539
kind of two plays here

315
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,450
is, first of all, this gives cloud flare access to

316
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,609
more data and I guess maybe easier for people to,

317
00:13:14,619 --> 00:13:18,210
to upload data into the cloud flare ecosystem, right?

318
00:13:18,219 --> 00:13:20,820
Because the idea here is you in theory,

319
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,260
just run this and start shoving stuff into it.

320
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:27,049
-- And now you have a website hosted somewhere.
-- Well, let's be even more brutal.

321
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:29,969
It allows people to shove content that may or may not be their

322
00:13:29,979 --> 00:13:33,530
own content into a system where that content can no longer be removed.

323
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,200
Yeah, we'll get to that one.

324
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:40,049
And, and secondly though is so let's face it today.

325
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:43,200
A significant amount of data is stored on S3

326
00:13:43,469 --> 00:13:44,109
and,

327
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:45,159
and

328
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,239
you can't build a new S3 and I I have a suspicion called

329
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:53,940
smart enough to know this and this is where a lot of people fail is they always think,

330
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,000
oh, we're going to compete with S3, we'll build a better and cheaper one.

331
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:00,570
But it's like you can't compete with the technology by copying it.

332
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,169
You have to out innovate it,

333
00:14:02,369 --> 00:14:05,229
right? The scale of three, you just, you can't approach their call

334
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:10,140
and, and so here. But, well, some you could, you just need to be able to

335
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,559
like someone like Claude

336
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:14,590
might be able to where they build enormous data centers with.

337
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:18,739
But

338
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,099
so here's my point. Here's my point though is

339
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:21,979
we,

340
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:26,309
we kind of got taken the model of we have a giant file store

341
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,140
in Amazon to we have a giant shared file store that is the planet Earth

342
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:33,570
and this is

343
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,659
this is awesome in a lot of ways.

344
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:39,400
But the thing that I guess is somewhat terrifying here is

345
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,270
you need a lot of people to join into this to really make it scale,

346
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:44,940
right?

347
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,380
Because essentially you're going to be limited by the

348
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:50,599
disk space that's on probably N divided or,

349
00:14:50,609 --> 00:14:51,140
or you know,

350
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,919
the number of users divided by some value because

351
00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:55,940
there's also going to be some level of duplication

352
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,359
and it's not infinite.

353
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,539
And so it, it will be interesting to see how that works. I mean, let's face it.

354
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:04,909
You could conceivably

355
00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:09,099
just fill this thing up with garbage and make it unusually slow and bad.

356
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:12,789
Well, my understanding is that currently all the IP FSS that are available,

357
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:15,750
essentially, you have to kind of, if you really want to use it,

358
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,380
you have to build your own IP FS Blockchain host it, run it and

359
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,340
get, you know, set up the gateway with cloud flare.

360
00:15:22,469 --> 00:15:25,429
And the other thing to remember is I think one of the big problems is solving crap,

361
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,780
disappearing off the web all the time

362
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:30,830
-- in that part. I like a
-- lot. Right. And that drives me nuts.

363
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,630
It's really

364
00:15:31,809 --> 00:15:32,140
annoying.

365
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,049
I was just at a conference besides Edmonton and, you know,

366
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,630
the, the main conference guy,

367
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,700
I guess a few days afterwards took the kind of took the site down and said, you know,

368
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,090
thanks.

369
00:15:40,099 --> 00:15:40,640
See you guys next year.

370
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,640
And I was like, oh, please put the content back up because I want to like reference.

371
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,969
Exactly. I was like, please like, and he did like, he was like, oh, yeah, good point.

372
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:47,250
Right.

373
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,770
And I guess it just didn't occur to him that people

374
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,299
would still want to look at the schedule after the fact.

375
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:52,219
And I'm like, no, trust me,

376
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:52,770
you

377
00:15:53,549 --> 00:15:55,840
please leave this up forever. You know, and that's,

378
00:15:56,119 --> 00:15:57,599
you know, like I still maintain

379
00:15:57,789 --> 00:15:58,849
cre.org. I haven't

380
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,580
updated or changed it in like over a decade.

381
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:04,130
Right? It just lives in an S3 bucket.

382
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:05,590
We're using cloud Florent to

383
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,900
turn it into a website and

384
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:08,590
that's it.

385
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,369
Right. And that, that will be there.

386
00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:14,239
I need to do this with, with my website breast.net and I should,

387
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,789
I should investigate this and see if I can't just use

388
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:19,500
IP FS instead because it would be fun to learn.

389
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:20,219
And

390
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:23,950
it, it like, it's just some static content at this point.

391
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,280
It's, it's nothing exciting. It hasn't done anything exciting in

392
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:28,049
you

393
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:31,200
as I understand it right now. You'd have to run your own IP FS.

394
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,460
Um I don't

395
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,479
know where you would get access to an IP

396
00:16:34,489 --> 00:16:36,330
FS where you can just upload your arbitrary content.

397
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,150
But no doubt those will exist at some point.

398
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,869
And that's the question. Right? Can I,

399
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,630
I don't know.

400
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:45,080
Well, the thing is also once you upload data into an IP FS,

401
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:47,630
as long as that IP F is running that content is available.

402
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,419
Well. Right. exactly.

403
00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:52,250
You can't selectively delete a bunch of it.

404
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:56,099
Like I can accidentally delete my half my S3 bucket or whatever and be like whoops

405
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:56,559
now.

406
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,020
Right. Right. Well, that's why.

407
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:01,900
But even then you can set up rules like for example, with S3,

408
00:17:01,909 --> 00:17:04,930
all my buckets have rules that anything I delete

409
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,680
sticks around for 30 days before it's deleted for real,

410
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:10,410
just so I can accidentally screw things up.

411
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,410
I'm more likely to forget to pay my Amazon bill of like $3 a month at some point.

412
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,140
And then, you know, Amazon will turn it off.

413
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:16,900
Right.

414
00:17:17,348 --> 00:17:17,848
Yeah, that,

415
00:17:17,858 --> 00:17:21,198
that is actually my biggest fear is my credit card being

416
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:24,128
declined someday and then they delete all of my data.

417
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,380
That's actually probably the biggest scenario for cloud data loss

418
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,280
is billing related issues.

419
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:31,459
So I,

420
00:17:31,469 --> 00:17:33,150
I think what I really like about this

421
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,520
IP FS though is that we're strongly establishing

422
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,969
these content networks as effectively as carriers in

423
00:17:39,979 --> 00:17:42,810
that classic American sense of the phone network of

424
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,790
we're not responsible for this content.

425
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:45,260
And,

426
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,579
but here's the trick cloud flare is getting to a point

427
00:17:47,589 --> 00:17:48,890
where they can sort of have their cake and eat it,

428
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,890
but we're not responsible for this content.

429
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,800
But if it is really heinous content, you can tell us and we will block it.

430
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,069
And so they have that out of,

431
00:17:56,219 --> 00:18:00,099
yeah, we, we kind of agree that there is some content that is so heinous that. Yeah, I

432
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:00,849
just,

433
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:01,579
I I'm not even

434
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:01,939
going to say

435
00:18:02,209 --> 00:18:02,250
that,

436
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:02,880
I mean,

437
00:18:03,099 --> 00:18:04,560
you can have copyright

438
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,530
issues, right?

439
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:09,410
Where somebody might own a video and if I upload the video to my website

440
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,739
and then you get a takedown order like that's perfectly legitimate and I'm OK with

441
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:14,869
so,

442
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,479
yeah, I mean, uh I think, I think this is good because quite frankly,

443
00:18:18,489 --> 00:18:20,489
obviously I'm a bit bullish on the Blockchain now

444
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,530
that my job title is Chief Blockchain Officer.

445
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:24,829
And I think

446
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:28,680
this property of many blockchains of, you know, once the data is in there,

447
00:18:28,689 --> 00:18:31,770
it's in there, it cannot be removed

448
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,609
is applicable to a lot of systems.

449
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:37,670
And here's the thing, I think that really changes things that people are forgetting

450
00:18:38,479 --> 00:18:42,660
data storage used to be expensive and we had to curate the data and get rid of stuff.

451
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:46,390
You know, it's like like a lot of libraries, right?

452
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:46,689
They,

453
00:18:46,699 --> 00:18:48,040
they get rid of their old books and they

454
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:50,969
get rid of garbage because they have finite space.

455
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,010
That's not a problem in the data world really anymore.

456
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,219
It, it is true.

457
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:57,329
Not

458
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,030
only that,

459
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:01,349
not only that, I guess here's the thing I keep thinking of,

460
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,989
this might end up being a terrible idea

461
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:08,780
and cloud flare might end up abandoning it in a couple of years.

462
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:10,949
But even if they abandon it,

463
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:14,910
they're going to learn things that will be invaluable in the future

464
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:18,569
-- and the rest of us will learn too because, you know the experience of it.
-- Exactly.

465
00:19:18,579 --> 00:19:22,469
Exactly. And I think that's the beauty of doing something like this is

466
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:27,449
even if you fail, if you learn some lessons, you didn't really fail.

467
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:31,890
And, and that's what excites me more than anything is the things we're going to learn

468
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:33,390
to go off on a tangent.

469
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,930
Our research and development has really been gutted in a lot

470
00:19:36,939 --> 00:19:39,300
of the western world and R and D has gone from,

471
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,199
you know, something we have as a budget line item

472
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:44,739
to, we spend money on start ups. So essentially you're, you're,

473
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:48,920
you're providing a lottery pool for people who do the R and D privately.

474
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:51,540
And if it works out then they, they win, you know,

475
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,619
they get acquired and they go public or whatever.

476
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:54,500
And

477
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:59,930
the other thing with R and D is a lot of R and D now is like, no, this has to be directly,

478
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:02,439
um, something we can product

479
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,609
like right away.

480
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:07,930
Like my favorite example being the swifter, like God, I hate the swifter. I get it.

481
00:20:07,939 --> 00:20:09,060
It's useful, it's handy.

482
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:12,290
But fundamentally the amount of R and D that was spent on the swifter to come up.

483
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,150
Like, it's like razor blades. Have you heard the latest thing in men's razor blades?

484
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,660
He has no idea

485
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,869
why would you want that?

486
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,010
Apparently it makes the shave more comfortable or something.

487
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:22,800
I'm just like, whatever I use

488
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:23,520
warm water,

489
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,449
hot water,

490
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,060
hot water, warm water. Yeah.

491
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,030
But, you know, remember we went, we were now,

492
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,229
I think what is the maximum six or eight blades or something stupid?

493
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:35,489
There's ones that vibrate, there's ones that squirt goo, there's ones with like,

494
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,819
something on the bar.

495
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,479
So you want to know something really funny is I bought

496
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:44,540
a safety razor because the blades are like three cents each

497
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,729
and it, it does a very nice job.

498
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:53,160
It's, and it's enjoyable. I have a brush and soap and,

499
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,839
yeah, I, I, I've done it in the past but the problem I find is with a safety razor, I,

500
00:20:56,849 --> 00:20:59,729
I gotta pay attention whereas with like a five bladed razor

501
00:20:59,739 --> 00:21:01,650
I can just hack away at my face half asleep and,

502
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,050
like,

503
00:21:02,229 --> 00:21:03,119
I just can't cover

504
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:03,800
myself.

505
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,569
It is true.

506
00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:08,579
It's easy to look like you've been in a bar

507
00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:11,500
fight with you to shaving with a safety razor.

508
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,010
But,

509
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,530
-- yeah, it's, it's an acquired skill.
-- Oh,

510
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:16,650
totally.

511
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,119
Yeah.

512
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,910
But, um, no, back to this, I mean,

513
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:20,939
it, I also like the idea of this,

514
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:23,739
you know, it drives me nuts like sun.com. It's gone.

515
00:21:25,449 --> 00:21:25,750
Right.

516
00:21:26,229 --> 00:21:26,660
Um,

517
00:21:26,989 --> 00:21:28,880
there's all these websites that had

518
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,239
good technical documentation that's just gone.

519
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:33,079
Right.

520
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:37,630
There's so much stuff that it was out there at some time and

521
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,819
it probably is still out there. But good luck.

522
00:21:40,829 --> 00:21:41,800
Well, here's, so,

523
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,400
here's the other half of that though is if

524
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,280
cloud flare decides not to host old content,

525
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:50,219
this doesn't save us because today it sounds like their,

526
00:21:50,229 --> 00:21:52,500
their front end is pretty much the only way

527
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,800
in at the moment and hopefully that changes.

528
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:55,109
But,

529
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,150
you know what I mean?

530
00:21:56,609 --> 00:22:01,030
Yeah. Oh, I agree. And I mean, ii, I don't know, I can't speak for cloud flare.

531
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,920
I mean, on the one hand, they,

532
00:22:03,199 --> 00:22:04,089
they do

533
00:22:04,219 --> 00:22:07,979
generally seem to be a reasonably well behaved network player,

534
00:22:07,989 --> 00:22:08,800
but on the other hand, like,

535
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,819
they're certainly not open sourcing their crown jewels.

536
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,800
And I don't blame the one bit for that because,

537
00:22:13,219 --> 00:22:15,180
like, come on folks, like, really, you know,

538
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:18,660
and part of it too is, you know, I keep coming back to with a lot of these cloud players,

539
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,500
for example,

540
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:22,589
let's say Amazon web services was like, oh, you know what?

541
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:24,849
We got a little drunk last night and we decided we're just,

542
00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:28,500
we're going to open source, all of our source code for all of Amazon web services.

543
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,750
Would it matter?

544
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,000
And the answer is not really because

545
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,510
the operational experience needed to run something,

546
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,609
the scale of Amazon

547
00:22:37,109 --> 00:22:41,130
I can give you the code and I can give you the source code and I can give you all the docs.

548
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,609
But like the only other people that have the expertise

549
00:22:44,619 --> 00:22:47,430
to run something that big are like Google and Microsoft,

550
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:52,089
nobody else has anything remotely that big that

551
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,910
and understands the scale issue,

552
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:55,589
right?

553
00:22:55,979 --> 00:22:57,869
You know, it'd be like giving you and me

554
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:02,060
the blueprints to an Airbus 320 it's like, no, we can't build this in our

555
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,680
garage. We can't do anything with that.

556
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,790
However, however you say that and there,

557
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,790
there are players in other parts of the world that could take that

558
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:16,050
and, and do something with it could damage Amazon as an organization. So

559
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:16,640
it

560
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,310
-- is a tricky line to walk for
-- sure what I'm saying essentially is we're,

561
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:22,189
we're at the point now

562
00:23:22,349 --> 00:23:24,569
and this is especially true with cloud services.

563
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:25,150
Cloud.

564
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,750
The thing people really got to remember is

565
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,709
cloud services are not just good software,

566
00:23:28,719 --> 00:23:31,109
they're good software combined with good operations.

567
00:23:32,069 --> 00:23:32,099
Yeah.

568
00:23:32,729 --> 00:23:33,859
And I think that's part of,

569
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:37,640
and I think that's part of what cloud flare has been doing traditionally is

570
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:39,859
cloud flare has traditionally been

571
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:43,430
taking on that ops work for their customers.

572
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:45,699
You know, I I very early went to Cloudflare because

573
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:51,119
oh, for like 20 bucks a month plus, uh what is it? $5 a month for every domain after that

574
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:55,680
you guys will do my SSL certificates and all of the, you'll eat all my D DOS

575
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:56,510
attacks

576
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,430
and you'll basically do like

577
00:23:58,535 --> 00:24:01,435
my DNS serving and, you know, a whole pile of stuff

578
00:24:01,885 --> 00:24:02,234
done.

579
00:24:02,405 --> 00:24:02,625
Right.

580
00:24:02,635 --> 00:24:04,905
They make it easier and, and let's, I mean,

581
00:24:04,915 --> 00:24:08,114
let's bring up this onion service right now because of that.

582
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:10,464
-- Like, oh
-- God, getting an onion service.

583
00:24:10,474 --> 00:24:11,635
Right. It's terrible.

584
00:24:11,645 --> 00:24:16,435
And, and now cloud flare, you have the ability to, basically, your website can be,

585
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:19,834
have, have a dot onion address on the Tor network.

586
00:24:19,844 --> 00:24:23,375
Well, it still feeds into the whole kind of concept of and this with

587
00:24:23,614 --> 00:24:26,234
Tor Onion especially we don't host the content

588
00:24:26,739 --> 00:24:27,560
and we can't

589
00:24:27,819 --> 00:24:30,959
necessarily like we can blacklist the content, but we cannot,

590
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:34,180
absolutely cannot take it down and we can't even tell you who's hosting it.

591
00:24:34,189 --> 00:24:36,959
It's just this dot onion address and God knows where it is,

592
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:40,599
you know, unless you're the NSA and you start turning off like half the internet to,

593
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:43,319
you know, ok, we turn off that half it was still up, ok.

594
00:24:43,329 --> 00:24:45,400
Turn off this other half it went down, ok.

595
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:47,920
You know, start localizing it like crazy stuff like that

596
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,810
if a Tor

597
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:53,650
service is run properly and not, you know, exposing its public IP address.

598
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,140
Yeah, it's, it's the, it's just, it's,

599
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:59,979
there's content online that we can't take off, we can block it but we can't

600
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,020
remove it.

601
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:04,520
Well, although now the one thing I will say

602
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:09,680
is the, the advantage I can see to what cloud flare is doing is

603
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,349
if you want to run your own onion service.

604
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:17,130
You, there's a lot of heavy lifting and it's actually painful to get. Right.

605
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:21,420
Whereas now anybody can have a dot Onion address,

606
00:25:21,739 --> 00:25:23,930
meaning there are people in

607
00:25:24,109 --> 00:25:30,329
certain places that can access your site where they may not have been able to before.

608
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:33,410
-- And so that could have an advantage.
-- Didn't,

609
00:25:33,689 --> 00:25:37,849
uh, China just block Twitch. Yeah, they just block Twitch game streaming.

610
00:25:38,099 --> 00:25:38,689
Ok.

611
00:25:39,199 --> 00:25:42,510
That's it. It's, it's, it's turned off for now until they decide to turn it back on.

612
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:43,430
Right.

613
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,250
Yeah, exactly. That's,

614
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:48,540
you know, that's, uh, yeah, like we run into this all the time.

615
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:51,829
Well, I run into this, you know, the, I want to CV e.org thing is

616
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:52,719
ad N

617
00:25:53,089 --> 00:25:54,989
sect to a Google form because

618
00:25:55,219 --> 00:25:56,569
I'm not hosting a form.

619
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:59,949
Google does it great, you know, it feeds into a spreadsheet and I can access it

620
00:26:00,229 --> 00:26:04,229
and, you know, once in a while, uh, everybody in China just can't do it

621
00:26:05,959 --> 00:26:09,489
interesting, you know, trying to block Google once in a while,

622
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:11,099
it just happens. Right.

623
00:26:12,719 --> 00:26:12,959
Right.

624
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,170
So, you know, and,

625
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:17,920
and I part of me really disagrees with that and part of me is really like, well,

626
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:20,510
you know, China is a sovereign country and they get to pick their rules

627
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,209
and what they

628
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:21,479
-- want
-- and

629
00:26:21,729 --> 00:26:21,819
it

630
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,719
is, I can disagree with them personally,

631
00:26:24,729 --> 00:26:28,479
but obviously what I think doesn't change their policy,

632
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,310
-- which
-- is

633
00:26:29,439 --> 00:26:29,530
probably

634
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:30,319
more to the

635
00:26:30,469 --> 00:26:33,170
point. I think we firmly established sovereign countries get to do what

636
00:26:33,569 --> 00:26:35,530
generally speaking they want to do.

637
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:36,849
Right. And that's just part of the,

638
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,160
that's just part of how it works

639
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:41,760
and that is a huge threat to clown flare. And they're

640
00:26:42,209 --> 00:26:42,660
raison

641
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:43,140
d'etre,

642
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:46,270
you know, that's their core thing is to get this content to people.

643
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:50,479
Well, things like the great firewall of China make that a big problem.

644
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,530
So, things like this

645
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,729
allow them to, you know, get their, get the content out.

646
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,819
Um And there's a lot of people with content who really,

647
00:26:59,829 --> 00:27:01,530
really want it to be available to everybody,

648
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:04,260
right?

649
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:07,300
And, and there's one other advantage, the Tor or not,

650
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:10,459
the Tor the cloud Fuller website says about this is today.

651
00:27:10,469 --> 00:27:12,589
If you visit a lot of websites through

652
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,040
Tor,

653
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:17,599
it will give you a capcha or it'll say things like you have to

654
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:21,270
wait to make sure you're not like conducting ad D OS or whatever.

655
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:25,589
And so it is like tours already slow and then you add that on top and it becomes really,

656
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:26,550
really slow.

657
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,689
And so I, I won't lie.

658
00:27:28,699 --> 00:27:33,900
I will appreciate that because I mean, anytime I see a dodgy URL,

659
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:36,469
I need to check out like fire up tour.

660
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,790
Like I, I'm not going to that with my browser, like I don't need a visit from the feds

661
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,670
to go into some crazy website.

662
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,310
So it, I don't know.

663
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:45,790
Again,

664
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,599
I feel like this is one of those things that

665
00:27:47,609 --> 00:27:51,660
I applaud cloud flare for trying something new and different.

666
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,060
And let's see if it works and even if it doesn't,

667
00:27:54,069 --> 00:27:56,160
we're going to learn something new and interesting.

668
00:27:56,739 --> 00:28:00,329
Well, but it also lets people experiment with these technologies and use them.

669
00:28:00,469 --> 00:28:00,989
You know, like,

670
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,239
because the bar to entry to a lot of technologies is quite painfully high.

671
00:28:05,739 --> 00:28:06,479
Yes.

672
00:28:06,699 --> 00:28:08,079
And not only that, you know what,

673
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:11,079
you know what I love with the onion addresses is

674
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,839
your onion address

675
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:15,969
is based upon an RS A

676
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,119
key ID

677
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:21,439
and like Facebook has one that has Facebook at the beginning of it.

678
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:25,300
And I guess they used an insane number of computers to brute force it

679
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:26,329
generate a

680
00:28:26,619 --> 00:28:27,859
couple billion keys.

681
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:29,880
When you're Facebook, you just run that

682
00:28:31,449 --> 00:28:33,359
and I can totally do that.

683
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:38,540
Actually you put in Amazon or just how much GP U time are you willing to buy?

684
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,140
Right, $0. That's my budget.

685
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:42,270
So

686
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,140
right. We'll get right on that.

687
00:28:45,489 --> 00:28:46,939
Indeed. Indeed.

688
00:28:46,949 --> 00:28:48,489
That that is one of the things I think of those

689
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,979
sometimes that could be fun to like just pre generate a gazillion

690
00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:52,780
torque

691
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,079
onion addresses and look for fun ones like with, you know,

692
00:28:56,579 --> 00:28:59,060
maybe foul language or clever sayings.

693
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:01,599
But again, I'm I'm too lazy to do that. So,

694
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:04,300
and I guess this is one of the other advantages log

695
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,969
flare brings is

696
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,989
you can use the dot onion addresses because

697
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,920
they're stored in a organization's DNS record,

698
00:29:12,199 --> 00:29:12,800
which is,

699
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:15,000
which is actually really cool because now you don't

700
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:17,209
have to worry about going to ridiculous string.

701
00:29:17,219 --> 00:29:20,239
I possibly can't type in and have to copy and paste from somewhere

702
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:24,900
to, I'll just type in, you know, conf.com and I end up in the Tor network.

703
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:25,719
So that's neat.

704
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,290
Yeah. No, like I said, the

705
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:33,010
usability is something we often forget. That is a huge barrier

706
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,060
to entry.

707
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:34,609
Uh

708
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,130
Yes. And Tor

709
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:36,979
is

710
00:29:37,099 --> 00:29:37,670
in Tor

711
00:29:37,829 --> 00:29:39,430
is comically unusable.

712
00:29:39,689 --> 00:29:40,030
It is,

713
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,219
is not too bad anymore.

714
00:29:42,229 --> 00:29:46,150
II, I tried out the Tor Browser the other day just to see if it, what it was like.

715
00:29:46,469 --> 00:29:48,969
It's nice. You run it, it connects and you do tour stuff.

716
00:29:48,979 --> 00:29:50,760
I mean, I wouldn't dare use it for anything.

717
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:54,150
I would consider a sensitive operation but for like just

718
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,410
checking out random URL S, it's, it's totally awesome.

719
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:01,969
-- All right, man, I, I think we need to call this one. Do you have any parting
-- thoughts?

720
00:30:01,989 --> 00:30:04,170
Maybe? Try, try something new today?

721
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:08,099
That's fair, I guess. Good job plot flair. Keep, keep the fire,

722
00:30:08,479 --> 00:30:08,849
right?

723
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:13,079
Alright, sweet. So thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.

724
00:30:13,089 --> 00:30:15,880
You can go to open source security podcast.com. Hit up the show notes.

725
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:20,660
I will put a link to the IP FS client in the show notes which actually Kurt and

726
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:24,000
I tried to find this before the show and it took us much longer than it should have.

727
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:24,599
So

728
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,469
-- we will save you the trouble if you go to
-- check out the

729
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:27,619
show

730
00:30:28,969 --> 00:30:31,319
it was very hard to find and then you can hit,

731
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:34,239
you hit us up on social media with the Pound Os S podcast.

732
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,760
Hashtag and yeah, Kurt, have a fantastic rest of your day.

733
00:30:38,109 --> 00:30:39,359
You too. Thanks everybody.
