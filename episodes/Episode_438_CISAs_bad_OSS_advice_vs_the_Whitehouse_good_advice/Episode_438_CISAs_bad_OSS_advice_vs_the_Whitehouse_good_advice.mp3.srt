Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,359
Kurt Siegfried and my partner in thinking about things, Josh Pressers,

2
00:00:12,369 --> 00:00:12,960
didn't you do?

3
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,810
Thinking about things just the other day?

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:15,119
I

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,569
think you did.

6
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:21,709
I'm gonna be honest with you about an hour after we record the podcast,

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,500
like somebody like Mel or Felix might ask me like, hey, what did you talk about?

8
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,069
And I'm like,

9
00:00:28,659 --> 00:00:29,770
stop.

10
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:30,930
Actually,

11
00:00:31,049 --> 00:00:33,990
I can attest to this because there's been more than one time I've told her, oh,

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,919
remember we talked about this on the podcast?

13
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,240
He's like, no, I don't remember it at all.

14
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:40,360
But I'm the same thing with emails.

15
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:45,119
Like I'll write an email and like an hour later you expect me to remember an email.

16
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,279
-- That's the
-- point of writing. But

17
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,419
-- yeah, whatever, like
-- same thing with the podcast because like,

18
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,880
if we'd done 10 or 20 of these, yeah, it'd be amazing and special.

19
00:00:53,889 --> 00:00:55,360
And now it's 400 later,

20
00:00:55,664 --> 00:00:57,234
here's what makes it even more exciting

21
00:00:57,554 --> 00:01:00,263
is. So you said partner and thinking about things

22
00:01:00,743 --> 00:01:03,313
and I'm pretty sure you said that in the last couple of weeks.

23
00:01:03,324 --> 00:01:05,063
But we also have some podcasts.

24
00:01:05,072 --> 00:01:06,973
We're like building up in the hopper because we've

25
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:08,933
got some vacation time and things coming up.

26
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:10,933
So, you probably said it.

27
00:01:10,944 --> 00:01:14,244
But I don't remember when, and I don't remember when that episode will come out.

28
00:01:14,253 --> 00:01:16,143
So you got to love it. It's all good.

29
00:01:16,164 --> 00:01:18,494
I really got to automate the transcription of these things.

30
00:01:18,674 --> 00:01:20,694
It's on the list. So, I've, I've done

31
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:26,388
a lot of research into that. I, OK. So I, I just, we kind of tangent on that note.

32
00:01:26,398 --> 00:01:29,227
I found a LLM model

33
00:01:29,487 --> 00:01:32,867
from the open A I people. I think they called it Whisper or something like that.

34
00:01:32,987 --> 00:01:33,947
Yeah, whisper will do it.

35
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:36,608
The challenge is, it's like a lot of LLM things.

36
00:01:36,617 --> 00:01:38,907
A good foundational model is nice and all.

37
00:01:38,947 --> 00:01:42,498
But what you want is something like me geek where it's like speaker identification

38
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:46,097
-- and all that other stuff.
-- It didn't do speaker identification, but it got

39
00:01:46,232 --> 00:01:48,802
a lot right, because I tried a couple of things.

40
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:51,211
-- So
-- whisper and speaker identification is one

41
00:01:51,222 --> 00:01:53,082
-- of those things where it
-- doesn't exist.

42
00:01:53,092 --> 00:01:54,162
It doesn't do it. Well,

43
00:01:55,262 --> 00:01:57,501
whisper technically, doesn't do it,

44
00:01:57,622 --> 00:02:01,442
but you can do it in a prestage actually relatively easily because like

45
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:04,281
the tone of your voice and the tone of my voice are like, it's like,

46
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,421
remember when that guy released the uh the vuvuzela

47
00:02:06,821 --> 00:02:08,222
filter notch

48
00:02:08,602 --> 00:02:10,991
for the World Cup and it's just like this one

49
00:02:11,996 --> 00:02:13,255
and like, oh, the Vuze Zs are

50
00:02:13,386 --> 00:02:14,255
gone. Thank God,

51
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,496
I miss them.

52
00:02:15,865 --> 00:02:18,895
I miss them every day anyway. All right, we have a real topic I don't want to talk about

53
00:02:19,156 --> 00:02:21,735
and stuff right now and, and, and transcriptions. It's on the list.

54
00:02:21,925 --> 00:02:25,776
Anyway, there have been two very interesting and we say

55
00:02:25,906 --> 00:02:29,216
not at all similar documents released from Cisa in

56
00:02:29,225 --> 00:02:30,565
the White House in the last couple of weeks.

57
00:02:30,576 --> 00:02:32,136
And I'm actually really excited because I've been like,

58
00:02:32,145 --> 00:02:35,576
bugging the heck out of Kurt to talk about this Cissa document,

59
00:02:35,585 --> 00:02:36,735
which I think is terrible.

60
00:02:37,235 --> 00:02:38,656
And then like,

61
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,399
I, I don't know, a couple of days ago from the time we're recording now,

62
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,770
the White House releases a thing.

63
00:02:43,779 --> 00:02:47,240
And I'm like, oh, holy crap. Thank goodness. We didn't record before this because,

64
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:48,050
because

65
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:48,179
I

66
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:53,229
CIA was July 8th and the White House was July 10th.

67
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,630
-- Ok.
-- And, but I didn't find the White House one, I think until the 12th,

68
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,589
so I missed it.

69
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,639
Yeah, it's, uh, well, I mean, do you want to, you're the American,

70
00:03:00,649 --> 00:03:01,800
you should talk about your own government.

71
00:03:01,809 --> 00:03:05,080
I want to start with the CIA document because I think it's, it's terrible.

72
00:03:05,649 --> 00:03:06,423
-- So,
-- yes

73
00:03:06,992 --> 00:03:10,022
and not. And, and what I love is, it's terrible on

74
00:03:10,402 --> 00:03:14,723
sort of such a deeply fundamental level. It actually takes a bit of explaining.

75
00:03:15,973 --> 00:03:17,453
Well, no, no, it's not just terrible.

76
00:03:17,462 --> 00:03:22,582
Like, like a hamburger with pickles and hot sauce and like,

77
00:03:22,593 --> 00:03:24,292
fig jam would be terrible.

78
00:03:24,302 --> 00:03:26,983
-- That would just be terrible.
-- I've never had that. I don't know.

79
00:03:26,992 --> 00:03:28,832
Well, now I want to try this.

80
00:03:29,223 --> 00:03:32,423
But you know what I'm saying? It's not like simple, terrible. It's complicated.

81
00:03:32,505 --> 00:03:36,005
It's complicated. I agree. I agree. OK, so let's just start, they, they

82
00:03:36,356 --> 00:03:40,126
put out a blog post that says continued progress towards a secure open

83
00:03:40,235 --> 00:03:43,026
-- source ecosystem.
-- Is it a blog post? It's in their news section.

84
00:03:43,035 --> 00:03:44,645
So I thought it was more official than a blog

85
00:03:44,755 --> 00:03:47,356
and it says blog on the top of the page. I don't know

86
00:03:48,016 --> 00:03:48,046
who

87
00:03:48,246 --> 00:03:48,576
cares.

88
00:03:48,705 --> 00:03:49,395
It doesn't matter,

89
00:03:49,626 --> 00:03:50,716
it doesn't matter. That's the thing.

90
00:03:50,725 --> 00:03:53,395
Like when the federal government releases a thing, this is true.

91
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,856
It's not like when you and I write a blog post, this was,

92
00:03:55,865 --> 00:03:57,916
-- this probably took three months
-- and

93
00:03:58,285 --> 00:03:58,886
mine goes

94
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:00,069
like they get,

95
00:04:00,429 --> 00:04:00,828
they get

96
00:04:01,339 --> 00:04:03,149
well, my work work ones, not

97
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:05,169
the stuff I write is me like

98
00:04:05,548 --> 00:04:05,608
that's

99
00:04:05,768 --> 00:04:05,899
coherent,

100
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,598
-- but
-- you don't have a domain ending in.gov.

101
00:04:08,688 --> 00:04:09,479
That's right. That's right.

102
00:04:09,488 --> 00:04:13,348
So anyway, they basically publish this, this post.

103
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:18,178
And I would say the fundamental message behind it is

104
00:04:18,188 --> 00:04:21,378
you should measure the goodness in your open source.

105
00:04:21,398 --> 00:04:21,658
Yes

106
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:22,549
and

107
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:26,691
well, sort of let's skip to. So they have this the idea of a framework

108
00:04:26,821 --> 00:04:27,291
because,

109
00:04:27,421 --> 00:04:28,411
well, but before that,

110
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:32,451
I want to literally read this one sentence that I think captures the essence of it.

111
00:04:32,462 --> 00:04:37,981
All the task of assessing the trustworthiness of Os S that is in use or

112
00:04:37,992 --> 00:04:40,291
that is being considered for use is more

113
00:04:40,302 --> 00:04:43,092
complex for Os S than for proprietary software

114
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:45,832
because there is generally speaking,

115
00:04:45,842 --> 00:04:48,332
no direct relationship between the authors of

116
00:04:48,342 --> 00:04:50,492
software and those who use the software.

117
00:04:50,502 --> 00:04:52,065
That's so cute because, you know,

118
00:04:52,075 --> 00:04:54,695
I was just talking to Bob at Microsoft the other day about my Windows.

119
00:04:54,704 --> 00:04:58,595
11 problems. Oh, hang on a second. I don't have a relationship with Microsoft.

120
00:04:58,605 --> 00:05:00,755
Beyond giving them money to use Windows.

121
00:05:00,765 --> 00:05:03,315
You don't, I mean, if you're a huge company,

122
00:05:03,325 --> 00:05:08,195
you do because you're probably in some sort of weird contractual agreement.

123
00:05:08,385 --> 00:05:11,445
I love this whole pretending that somehow

124
00:05:11,904 --> 00:05:15,154
I can go to like Google and be like, hey, Google, I,

125
00:05:15,165 --> 00:05:18,154
I deleted a file and could you please fix it for me?

126
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,920
They would laugh at you except they can't even get your message,

127
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:22,920
right.

128
00:05:22,929 --> 00:05:27,119
Like I remember, I remember I was speaking with somebody I know who works at Google,

129
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:31,350
who I was like, I want to report a, like a weird bug and they're like,

130
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:32,760
I don't think you can do that.

131
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,579
There's no way

132
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,760
and, and, and, but he was also like, he's like, I don't think I can do that either.

133
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:41,690
-- Like he couldn't even do it internally.
-- It wouldn't surprise me at all. Right.

134
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:44,720
Here's so, here's what I think is the important part of this.

135
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:48,279
They have a framework which we can look at. I don't, it's, it's kind of unimportant.

136
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,760
The point is this sort of message around trustworthy, open source

137
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,649
I think is flawed fundamentally from two different sides.

138
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,109
And actually the the the document from the White House

139
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:05,059
gets part of this right? And we're going to read that, I'll read that in just a minute.

140
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,709
But there's the stop trying to measure open source quality.

141
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,886
That's not the point of open source.

142
00:06:12,967 --> 00:06:17,777
The point is open source is a thing that exists that you can become a part of.

143
00:06:17,786 --> 00:06:21,476
Not like let's measure open source and figure out which open source is the best,

144
00:06:21,486 --> 00:06:25,946
which leads to the second half of that, which is in the vast majority of cases.

145
00:06:26,027 --> 00:06:29,777
If you measure open source you're using and it scores a zero,

146
00:06:29,796 --> 00:06:33,337
you're still gonna use it because there's nothing else to use.

147
00:06:33,346 --> 00:06:36,914
So what's the point of this stupid measuring in the first place?

148
00:06:37,114 --> 00:06:39,484
It's not that there's nothing else to use. It's worse than that.

149
00:06:39,493 --> 00:06:42,473
It's you're already using it. And the cost of switching will be

150
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:43,794
quite significant.

151
00:06:44,373 --> 00:06:47,734
Like even if they're perfect example, Apache and engine X,

152
00:06:47,743 --> 00:06:51,794
they are actually quite comparable pieces of software, web servers that

153
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:56,651
given an Apache configuration and set up, you could actually with not too long,

154
00:06:56,661 --> 00:06:59,140
probably tens of minutes to hours, replace it with engine

155
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,520
X.

156
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,980
OK? Try doing that with Kubernetes.

157
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:04,800
-- What exactly are you going to replace Kubernetes with
-- Docker

158
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:06,131
-- Swarm?
-- Right?

159
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,101
Or like maybe Terraform except

160
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,510
-- Terraform went off the deep end and it went to some weird open source name
-- but

161
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,730
Terraform isn't

162
00:07:13,091 --> 00:07:14,330
Kubernetes. That's not.

163
00:07:15,221 --> 00:07:18,571
But I'm saying like the things that are like comparable

164
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,369
like there is Lib J peg.

165
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,450
That's it. Like that's,

166
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,690
-- that's
-- all folks and any framework lib J peg is going to score zero.

167
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,459
And then the other thing that really gets me is I always come

168
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,029
back to this thing with the open source versus closed source again,

169
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,329
like I just love how we sort of pretend like having a contractual relationship with

170
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:43,510
an entity that is typically on several

171
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:46,109
orders of magnitude larger than the customer.

172
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:48,989
Microsoft, Apple Amazon, those are all

173
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,709
-- basically trillion dollar companies at this point.
-- OK?

174
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,410
-- I have a theory about this actually.
-- But my point is

175
00:07:54,622 --> 00:07:56,721
even if you're the US government and you're huge,

176
00:07:56,902 --> 00:08:01,481
if you said Microsoft, we really want the default windows background to be read.

177
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:03,872
-- They'd be like, no,
-- probably not,

178
00:08:03,881 --> 00:08:07,622
they might listen to you a little bit if you have a big enough contract,

179
00:08:07,631 --> 00:08:09,272
but odds are not good.

180
00:08:09,451 --> 00:08:11,532
Well, but here, here's my theory about this though

181
00:08:12,062 --> 00:08:14,721
and, and this is true of the open SSF scorecard as well.

182
00:08:14,731 --> 00:08:17,002
I know we've harped about that many times in the past.

183
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:19,752
And I think this is a very similar problem is

184
00:08:19,873 --> 00:08:24,253
people who often work on these sort of frameworks and frame these problems.

185
00:08:24,264 --> 00:08:26,894
They're always framing it in this context of,

186
00:08:26,903 --> 00:08:29,753
I need to make sure the thing I'm taking in is trustworthy.

187
00:08:29,764 --> 00:08:33,773
And I think that feels like a very big company security attitude to me, right?

188
00:08:33,783 --> 00:08:35,403
Where these big companies are all about, like,

189
00:08:35,573 --> 00:08:38,573
we're going to create these frameworks, we're going to create these rules,

190
00:08:38,582 --> 00:08:41,023
we're going to control our risk that's coming in.

191
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:43,972
-- Right. Like that is what they do.
-- Well, it, it's,

192
00:08:44,073 --> 00:08:44,783
they want like,

193
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,125
sure we want to accept the risk or refuse the

194
00:08:47,135 --> 00:08:49,666
risk or ensure the risk or compensate for the risk.

195
00:08:49,895 --> 00:08:51,466
And we're a big company and blah, blah, blah,

196
00:08:51,486 --> 00:08:54,625
they operate in a world that most of us don't

197
00:08:54,716 --> 00:08:58,625
-- because
-- they can because they're spending sometimes millions of dollars.

198
00:08:58,635 --> 00:09:00,806
-- But
-- because they have to, so without going into

199
00:09:01,005 --> 00:09:02,945
detail, the CS A just has a new member,

200
00:09:02,955 --> 00:09:06,426
which is a large bank and sometimes we sign up new members and they're like, cool,

201
00:09:06,435 --> 00:09:07,755
whatever we pay you, we're a member.

202
00:09:07,765 --> 00:09:08,065
Great.

203
00:09:08,226 --> 00:09:10,265
And then we have other members like this bank

204
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,159
that is asking us for,

205
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:15,809
it was eight different kinds of insurance to prove that we have it

206
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,549
right.

207
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:18,390
And like most of these,

208
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,359
I actually know about most of these insurances

209
00:09:20,369 --> 00:09:22,090
because I've been in the business long enough,

210
00:09:22,099 --> 00:09:23,239
like some of it was like, you know,

211
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,630
just standard business insurance and then it was like,

212
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,669
there's some other insurances that they wanted to make sure that we had and if not,

213
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,179
why not?

214
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:29,830
And blah, blah, blah.

215
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:30,630
And

216
00:09:30,989 --> 00:09:33,849
that's the like this is like asking the US like

217
00:09:33,859 --> 00:09:36,030
the US government lives in the US government world,

218
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:39,409
they don't live in the world that the most of us, the rest of us live in.

219
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:43,349
No, I agree. I agree. And so their view of reality

220
00:09:43,729 --> 00:09:44,309
is

221
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:48,359
different than our view of reality because their reality is actually different.

222
00:09:48,369 --> 00:09:48,640
-- But
-- I,

223
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,869
I don't think that counts because we're going to read a

224
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,599
thing from the White House here in just a minute.

225
00:09:52,609 --> 00:09:54,520
I'm just going to read it now because it's, it's good.

226
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,890
-- Well,
-- but some people are clever enough to actually accept a

227
00:09:57,219 --> 00:10:02,440
more, let's say, broadly accepted version of reality versus the one they live in.

228
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,280
Maybe.

229
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:03,960
Sure,

230
00:10:04,219 --> 00:10:06,510
look, here's, here's what I think is so good.

231
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,463
So the White House released a memorandum. Um

232
00:10:09,674 --> 00:10:10,883
Does it have a title

233
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:14,554
memorandum for the heads of executive departments and agencies

234
00:10:14,903 --> 00:10:16,424
subject, administrative

235
00:10:16,564 --> 00:10:21,143
uh sorry, administration, cybersecurity priorities for the fy 2026 budget. Ok.

236
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:24,424
-- That must be it.
-- It's boring. So, you know, it's actually kind of interesting.

237
00:10:24,434 --> 00:10:27,984
-- It's very
-- boring and it covers a wide variety of topics.

238
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,763
It's not focused on open source by any means.

239
00:10:29,773 --> 00:10:30,244
But no,

240
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,544
they have a paragraph about open source that I'm just going

241
00:10:32,554 --> 00:10:34,968
to read the whole paragraph because it's so freaking good.

242
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:38,228
And it says improve open source software security and sustainability.

243
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:41,607
-- That's like the paragraph header,
-- the fact that they used the word sustainability.

244
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:42,778
Yes, we'll get to that. I

245
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:43,148
know

246
00:10:43,427 --> 00:10:46,328
that's the point. That's the point, right. That's the key.

247
00:10:46,617 --> 00:10:47,747
And this is where I read this.

248
00:10:47,757 --> 00:10:50,388
And I'm like, there's no way this is from the government, but anyway.

249
00:10:50,398 --> 00:10:53,987
It says recognizing the many benefits of open source software

250
00:10:53,997 --> 00:10:57,247
departments and agencies should ensure secure use of open source

251
00:10:57,257 --> 00:11:00,752
software and contributing to maintaining open source code to help

252
00:11:00,762 --> 00:11:05,192
sustain components depended on by the agency contribute to maintaining.

253
00:11:06,921 --> 00:11:09,841
I love that. Right. And that's the point. Ok. Well, I'm going to keep going.

254
00:11:09,851 --> 00:11:10,921
Then it says maintenance activities

255
00:11:10,932 --> 00:11:12,961
could include developing mechanisms that enable

256
00:11:12,971 --> 00:11:14,702
and encourage employees and contractors to

257
00:11:14,711 --> 00:11:16,622
contribute to open source software components

258
00:11:16,932 --> 00:11:18,831
including security related contributions,

259
00:11:18,841 --> 00:11:21,952
monitoring changes to code tracking and correcting potential error

260
00:11:22,036 --> 00:11:24,426
and flaws in the code and other related activities.

261
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,885
Agencies should integrate open source software

262
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:29,156
considerations including process to review,

263
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:32,315
approve inventory and centralize open source consumption into agency.

264
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:34,255
It and cybersecurity governance structures,

265
00:11:34,265 --> 00:11:35,955
agencies are encouraged to study the

266
00:11:35,966 --> 00:11:38,216
benefits that could be gained through establishment

267
00:11:38,385 --> 00:11:41,786
of a governance function modeled after private sector,

268
00:11:41,796 --> 00:11:44,255
open source program offices that defines roles,

269
00:11:44,265 --> 00:11:46,255
responsibilities and methods of engagement.

270
00:11:46,869 --> 00:11:48,960
This is remarkably sane.

271
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,039
Well, it's like that Swiss thing that came out where it's kind of like, yeah,

272
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:54,760
there's this the boat sized hole of, you know,

273
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:58,440
you must uh this this one Swiss government thing is like you you need

274
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,000
to start using open source with the

275
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,659
exception of pre-existing third party licensing,

276
00:12:02,669 --> 00:12:03,150
blah, blah, blah.

277
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:06,619
So like Microsoft and all, but the fact that people are saying this out loud now

278
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,609
is yeah, like this whole sustainability thing

279
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:10,400
that's

280
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,799
so big because they're no longer saying

281
00:12:12,969 --> 00:12:14,900
you have to use open source securely. It's,

282
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:18,559
you have to participate in using open source securely.

283
00:12:18,969 --> 00:12:21,729
Yes. Well, and that's the thing, right. That's the key

284
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:25,210
is there's no, we'll put quotes around secure,

285
00:12:25,229 --> 00:12:27,690
but there's no secure usage of open source where

286
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,479
you are strictly a consumer of that open source.

287
00:12:30,489 --> 00:12:31,409
That's not a thing.

288
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:32,780
And this is where I think there's like such

289
00:12:32,789 --> 00:12:35,330
a stark contrast where sis is basically pulling the,

290
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,869
you should be afraid of this thing.

291
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,489
So we built a tool that lets you be more afraid versus the White House.

292
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,450
That's basically saying

293
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:46,070
-- get involved, you chumps like come on.
-- So sis a though, so that's the thing.

294
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,630
The White House is different in that they are in theory

295
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,950
like kind of the highest level of policy and strategy.

296
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,989
I mean, in theory, the

297
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,419
government

298
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:58,359
and SISA is much more down in the dirt. And a perfect example of where CIA

299
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,109
where their framework is beyond terrible

300
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,549
is I I'll just read it first for the project.

301
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:07,820
The number of active contributors are unexpected changes in account ownership

302
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,419
for the product, the presence of known vulnerabilities or out of date dependencies

303
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,109
for protections,

304
00:13:14,309 --> 00:13:18,049
whether the project requires two factor authentication on developer accounts.

305
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:22,900
Sorry, I don't mean to laugh at that, but it is so ridiculous uh for policies,

306
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:24,809
whether the project requires code review

307
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,950
or has responsible vulnerability disclosure process.

308
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:31,250
So there's two problems with this number one, these are all sort of like policy,

309
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,280
things, not actual security, things like

310
00:13:33,719 --> 00:13:37,460
-- a project can require code reviews, but do they actually get done or not?
-- Right.

311
00:13:37,469 --> 00:13:37,739
Right.

312
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:42,950
My favorite is when I have code reviews on my repo and then I code review my code.

313
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:46,929
-- This
-- leads to the second subtle thing of

314
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,190
why this these four things are beyond uselessly

315
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,900
terrible is because they are building a framework

316
00:13:52,909 --> 00:13:55,159
on what they can measure easily today.

317
00:13:55,289 --> 00:13:58,840
That is true. I'll agree with that statement. These can be measured.

318
00:13:59,570 --> 00:13:59,669
No,

319
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,940
no, easily. Because for example, I have actually done this. It's kind of a jerk move.

320
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:05,619
I have

321
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,109
like when we're evaluating SAS

322
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,059
suppliers,

323
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:12,140
I literally will look for what their security contact is and email them and say

324
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:14,219
I need to report a security vulnerability.

325
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:15,179
What do we do?

326
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,030
Oh, that's not bad.

327
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,950
And then I see if they actually respond or not and I kind of go like, sorry,

328
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,900
this was a test

329
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:25,780
-- but like I need to make sure you respond.
-- I mean, that's fair. That's fair.

330
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,450
And, and, and some of them, you know,

331
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,729
I get like an auto responder five minutes later and then I

332
00:14:29,739 --> 00:14:31,679
get like a human response a day later and I'm like,

333
00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:33,859
totally acceptable. Yeah. Yeah, for

334
00:14:33,969 --> 00:14:34,000
sure.

335
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:38,010
-- And some of them I never hear back and I'm like, oh, ok then yeah,
-- that went,

336
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,830
that went to a black hole

337
00:14:39,982 --> 00:14:42,562
and some of them I can't find a way to, to do it.

338
00:14:42,862 --> 00:14:43,442
Yeah, for Sure.

339
00:14:43,453 --> 00:14:47,663
Or I finally or my favorite is I'll email their sales department because sales like

340
00:14:47,783 --> 00:14:50,913
-- they will reply to your
-- email. Yeah, sales and legal always reply.

341
00:14:50,922 --> 00:14:51,242
Yeah.

342
00:14:51,362 --> 00:14:56,882
Yeah. But the point is none of this is anything that requires work to measure.

343
00:14:56,893 --> 00:14:59,922
It's just passive, they're measuring passive things.

344
00:14:59,973 --> 00:15:02,242
Well, and thank goodness that that's one thing I will say.

345
00:15:02,252 --> 00:15:04,083
Thank goodness it's passive because goodness

346
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:04,375
know,

347
00:15:04,385 --> 00:15:06,195
we don't need every company on the planet

348
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:09,366
emailing every open source maintainer asking them questions.

349
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,656
That would be ridiculous.

350
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:13,255
-- Well, we did that with log for J It was awesome.
-- That's true.

351
00:15:13,435 --> 00:15:17,476
And, well, and so, you know what stuck out to me when I, when I saw this at first was

352
00:15:17,745 --> 00:15:20,606
the very first one. It says a number of active contributors.

353
00:15:20,945 --> 00:15:24,575
-- It's one, it's always one. Well, they,
-- they want more than one

354
00:15:24,765 --> 00:15:26,296
in their framework thing that might have built them.

355
00:15:26,306 --> 00:15:28,296
It's got something about checking

356
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,840
the number of maintainers and my first thought was Man XZ almost had two,

357
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,429
but now they're back down to one.

358
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:34,530
Well,

359
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,280
every project

360
00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:41,479
I use statistically is there's one person who has done like 80% of the commands and,

361
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,210
you know, it's,

362
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,010
it's a perfect statistical

363
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:47,390
patto distribution across every project I've ever looked, you know,

364
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,239
with the exceptions of the ones that have a robot,

365
00:15:49,489 --> 00:15:51,849
it, with all the commits in the robot. Oh, I know. Depend

366
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:55,229
aot or whatever. Oh, that thing is really, yeah. Here. OK.

367
00:15:55,239 --> 00:15:57,640
Not to go too tangential but does depend a

368
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:57,770
bot

369
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,710
count as a good contributor.

370
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,390
I mean,

371
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,979
I would argue, depend

372
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,539
aot can't approve pr s.

373
00:16:03,549 --> 00:16:07,039
-- So I would argue, no,
-- I would argue if a project is using,

374
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,950
depend a bot and actually rapidly updating their dependencies.

375
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:11,260
I

376
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:11,700
mean, that,

377
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:12,320
that's what they

378
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:12,630
keep

379
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,020
saying

380
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:13,539
they want.

381
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:15,530
Yeah, that's good behavior. I agree.

382
00:16:15,669 --> 00:16:19,109
I mean, I think you get into a weird discussion about

383
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,130
what is a maintainer and things like that.

384
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,190
-- And I don't want to do that today, but I
-- think more it boils down to.

385
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:24,419
Ok,

386
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:28,260
here's the world that all these people want is I want all my dependencies up to date

387
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,469
but nothing to break.

388
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,039
That's it. That's what they want.

389
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:35,929
And, and every project should have 15 maintainers that way if anyone gets hurt

390
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:36,500
and all

391
00:16:36,711 --> 00:16:38,242
containers are contributing equally.

392
00:16:38,252 --> 00:16:42,252
So, like there isn't one core maintainer we can't afford to lose.

393
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:43,831
And ironically, this is exactly.

394
00:16:43,841 --> 00:16:46,812
Red Hat's business model of, we will take all this software

395
00:16:46,961 --> 00:16:49,041
and if like, the maintainer isn't available or

396
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:51,961
isn't, he's on vacation this week or she's not

397
00:16:52,122 --> 00:16:53,202
responding,

398
00:16:53,492 --> 00:16:54,591
we will ship a patch

399
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:56,822
hopefully in a reasonable amount of time and

400
00:16:56,942 --> 00:16:58,581
you can consume it and pay us for it.

401
00:16:58,942 --> 00:17:02,452
-- Well, that doesn't
-- scale. Right. I mean, we're, we're so far past that now.

402
00:17:02,783 --> 00:17:05,134
Right. There's like, how many millions of N PM packages

403
00:17:05,313 --> 00:17:08,413
-- for
-- sure. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Well, and that's the thing.

404
00:17:08,423 --> 00:17:11,713
Like when Red Hat started that business, there were what,

405
00:17:11,743 --> 00:17:14,413
1000 open source projects on the planet,

406
00:17:14,753 --> 00:17:18,773
-- like,
-- maybe, but we're in wide use. Yeah, probably. I mean,

407
00:17:19,114 --> 00:17:23,073
that's the thing that blows my mind is like, you look at those NP MS and wow,

408
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:27,053
$10 million a week, like, even if 90% of them are automated bots,

409
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,374
-- that's still
-- a lot.

410
00:17:28,635 --> 00:17:30,656
Yeah, for sure. Well, and not only that,

411
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:31,536
when

412
00:17:31,686 --> 00:17:34,855
one of the pieces of signal people look for,

413
00:17:34,865 --> 00:17:38,395
when they're looking at a project is they will go to the N PM page, for example,

414
00:17:38,406 --> 00:17:40,875
and be like, how many downloads does this thing get a week?

415
00:17:40,995 --> 00:17:44,436
And it's 10 million, you're going to say it must be a good project.

416
00:17:44,446 --> 00:17:46,215
Everything is fine here.

417
00:17:46,985 --> 00:17:47,995
But what choice do I have?

418
00:17:48,005 --> 00:17:51,306
Like I, you and I have actually spent time investigating and, and,

419
00:17:51,316 --> 00:17:54,456
and like trying to, you know, pick open source and like

420
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:55,699
yada yada yada

421
00:17:55,819 --> 00:17:59,130
and to this date, like essentially it boils down to,

422
00:17:59,239 --> 00:18:02,099
I can occasionally find a good signal

423
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:05,280
and I can occasionally find a terrible signal. Yeah.

424
00:18:05,609 --> 00:18:11,449
And so there's once in a while where I can say, wow, like this project clearly cares.

425
00:18:11,459 --> 00:18:12,550
This is great.

426
00:18:12,739 --> 00:18:14,150
Like a good example would be Korda,

427
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,939
Korda had their own in house built Java Applet server.

428
00:18:18,949 --> 00:18:20,489
And then one version they're like,

429
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,829
we got rid of it and replaced it with an open source component

430
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:25,550
that probably has a lot less vulnerabilities than the crap we wrote.

431
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,280
And then another time they're like, oh,

432
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,930
this dependency we track had a vulnerability.

433
00:18:29,939 --> 00:18:30,939
Doesn't have a CV or anything,

434
00:18:30,949 --> 00:18:33,479
but we caught it and we fixed it like we updated it great.

435
00:18:33,489 --> 00:18:36,420
And then there's the, the, the opposite side where, you know, you see a,

436
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:39,599
-- a project where,
-- no, I don't think there's an opposite side.

437
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,380
-- I don't think there are
-- projects that refuse.

438
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:46,040
But for example, are they haven't shipped an update in eight years

439
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:50,380
-- and it's dead.
-- That doesn't make it bad. It might make it dead.

440
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,109
But that's a different thing. There's so here's the thing.

441
00:18:53,209 --> 00:18:55,040
I think this is where I'm going to split

442
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,165
hairs over this one because I think it's important.

443
00:18:57,175 --> 00:19:01,385
There is projects, I think all projects try to do the right thing.

444
00:19:01,395 --> 00:19:06,145
I don't think any open source project is going to purposely try to be bad, right?

445
00:19:06,155 --> 00:19:09,704
I don't think that is a thing. I think there are projects that are dead.

446
00:19:09,824 --> 00:19:12,954
I think there are projects that react negatively

447
00:19:13,074 --> 00:19:17,224
to, we'll say misbehaving community members.

448
00:19:17,234 --> 00:19:21,635
But I fundamentally don't think any project is necessarily bad.

449
00:19:21,645 --> 00:19:24,665
And I think that's part of what makes this discussion so weird

450
00:19:24,939 --> 00:19:25,579
is

451
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,619
tools like what, what

452
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,839
Sisa has built,

453
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,719
they're trying to create two buckets, good and bad

454
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:34,189
and there isn't a bad bucket, right?

455
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:38,719
There's good and there might be better, but I don't think bad is a thing.

456
00:19:38,949 --> 00:19:41,520
I would argue there is a bad bucket, but it's very small.

457
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,569
And in my experience of looking at hundreds,

458
00:19:43,969 --> 00:19:46,380
probably less than 1000 but more than 500 projects,

459
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,079
there's like,

460
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:49,939
literally a handful where it's like they have outstanding vulnerabilities,

461
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:51,959
no maintainers or anything going on.

462
00:19:52,045 --> 00:19:52,864
And it's just like,

463
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:56,944
-- like it's a combination of dead and has known flaws
-- that's just dead.

464
00:19:56,954 --> 00:19:57,604
That's ok.

465
00:19:57,775 --> 00:19:59,224
Well, but it has known flaws.

466
00:19:59,234 --> 00:20:02,824
Like there's so there's dead but not known flaws and that's,

467
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:04,185
you can probably use that safely

468
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:07,984
-- but stuff that has known flaws,
-- no dead is dead.

469
00:20:07,994 --> 00:20:11,925
I would say it's dead and you know about some of the vulnerabilities

470
00:20:11,935 --> 00:20:14,505
or it's dead and you don't know about some of the vulnerabilities,

471
00:20:14,515 --> 00:20:17,625
-- but there's still a crap load of vulnerabilities back
-- to this.

472
00:20:17,635 --> 00:20:19,055
None of that matters

473
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:22,619
because it's in my dependency chain. I can't change it easily.

474
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:29,099
-- Yeah, you're not changing it or
-- I'm using it and replacing it is like, either, well,

475
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:32,180
I could stop using it and if I could stop using it then, well,

476
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,349
I should just do that with all the stuff I can stop using

477
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,199
and

478
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:36,790
reduce my risk.

479
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,890
But obviously I'm using it because it does something

480
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,550
that I needed it to do at some point.

481
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,270
And so

482
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:46,510
what gets me like, I think the problem is a lot of this software is infrastructure.

483
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,060
It's not a nice to have Solitaire or mobile game. It's infrastructure

484
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:52,910
and we don't have infrastructure unless we need it.

485
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,390
-- Because it's expensive.
-- I will agree with that.

486
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,869
And I think there's a second piece to that, which is,

487
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,780
let's say we do stand up some sort of brand new Greenfield thing

488
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,069
that has no vulnerabilities in any of the stuff we're using.

489
00:21:05,689 --> 00:21:09,050
How many days do you think it'll take before you start having vulnerabilities?

490
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,739
-- I bet three or
-- less.

491
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,310
And the other thing is like by definition,

492
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,420
anything the government does is pretty much almost

493
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,849
always infrastructure and boring life have to happen.

494
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,760
-- That's good. We
-- need

495
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,770
boring. Like they do occasionally mobile games.

496
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,530
Like there's a mobile waste management game and was

497
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,729
-- part of my waste management app from
-- the government.

498
00:21:24,739 --> 00:21:25,689
Seriously,

499
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:27,560
it was the city of Edmonton has waste

500
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:29,670
management app that basically does two useful things.

501
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,589
One it tells you when your garbage day is and two, it's got a little,

502
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:35,119
it tells you how to sort your garbage because I guess some people are not so

503
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,869
good at that and it's got a little built in game to sort your garbage.

504
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:37,890
I

505
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:40,050
want to play this game.

506
00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:42,599
It's, you just throw like the bottle in the right thing.

507
00:21:42,609 --> 00:21:43,770
It's the same thing as curious George.

508
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:47,859
Uh

509
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:48,949
Anyway,

510
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,729
and that's the thing by definition, what

511
00:21:51,849 --> 00:21:53,550
Cisa is dealing with is the government, by definition,

512
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,770
what the government is doing is infrastructure and that is always complicated.

513
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:00,479
-- It
-- doesn't matter though. I don't, I think that point is moot. I think you've got

514
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:03,930
an example here. We have two agencies, right?

515
00:22:03,939 --> 00:22:06,569
-- But I don't know if the White House counts as an agency.
-- Well, no, no, no.

516
00:22:06,579 --> 00:22:08,050
The White House is non agency.

517
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,489
-- All right,
-- whatever you've got the CIA you have, the White House

518
00:22:10,885 --> 00:22:14,194
is saying you need, you should measure open source and be afraid.

519
00:22:14,204 --> 00:22:16,425
And the White House is saying get involved.

520
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:21,474
My hope is that the White House Guidance trickles its way around

521
00:22:21,905 --> 00:22:24,844
and we see these agencies because it's not even just

522
00:22:24,854 --> 00:22:27,175
Cisa I've seen this come from more than one agency,

523
00:22:27,185 --> 00:22:29,484
especially lots of big companies that I've seen.

524
00:22:29,494 --> 00:22:31,584
But I'm hopeful this guidance will trickle around

525
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:36,599
and we will seem less of a, we should measure our open source

526
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,359
and that turns into something like

527
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:45,550
we need to be like good shepherds of open source, not just like

528
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:51,449
a, a some sort of lamprey sucking all of the blood we can find out of this ecosystem.

529
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,589
I'm going to say something a little mean, which is

530
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:59,050
the CIA Guidance is both wrong and useless in that. Even if you follow the

531
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:02,694
CSA Guidance, implement it to A T it's not helpful.

532
00:23:02,704 --> 00:23:07,915
The White House advice is look, you need to use OS S so get involved and get good.

533
00:23:08,244 --> 00:23:12,494
The CIA advice is be afraid, make it measurement,

534
00:23:12,614 --> 00:23:16,834
pick a good one except we're just, there's not good ones like there's, or, or,

535
00:23:16,844 --> 00:23:18,885
or there are good ones like the Linux kernel

536
00:23:18,895 --> 00:23:21,635
or curl or whatever like big nice mature projects.

537
00:23:22,064 --> 00:23:24,785
But, like, when you're looking for a bunch of N PM node stuff,

538
00:23:24,795 --> 00:23:27,145
there's nothing like that in that space.

539
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:28,479
Right.

540
00:23:28,489 --> 00:23:32,589
Like when I'm in my Python pip little world and I'm looking for a thing, like, ok.

541
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:36,670
Yeah, there's pandas and numpy and psych and NLTK. They're freaking awesome.

542
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,810
But when I'm looking for, like, a thing to convert, like, html to markdown,

543
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:42,979
it's like, yeah, I'm, I'm just picking kind of whatever works.

544
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:43,089
Right.

545
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:43,869
Exactly.

546
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,540
And there's like 17 of them,

547
00:23:45,739 --> 00:23:48,270
you know, and three of them have not been updated in this.

548
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,739
I was going to say this decade actually also the last decade.

549
00:23:51,709 --> 00:23:54,680
And in some cases though, it's, that's ok because I was, I,

550
00:23:54,819 --> 00:23:56,699
I was looking at some file conversion utility

551
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,189
and it was like last done in like 2008,

552
00:23:59,199 --> 00:24:01,920
but it's like that file format is so simple and so done that.

553
00:24:02,709 --> 00:24:05,550
No, that's it. Like it, this is it, it's done,

554
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,079
you know,

555
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,500
there's a security vulnerability in it.

556
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,189
There's also some funny examples of this where

557
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:13,229
I remember I wrote a tool one time that I,

558
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:15,630
people kept mailing me these spreadsheets and they

559
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,030
were spreadsheets produced by some other tool.

560
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,030
And so they had a completely known format.

561
00:24:20,405 --> 00:24:23,375
I had to extract all of the CV E ss out of them.

562
00:24:23,484 --> 00:24:25,905
I had to parse the CV ES and then

563
00:24:26,074 --> 00:24:27,454
add back in

564
00:24:27,564 --> 00:24:30,844
our basically justifications for these.

565
00:24:31,285 --> 00:24:33,645
And I wrote a, I, I basically just looked,

566
00:24:33,655 --> 00:24:38,055
I typed in the stack overflow like I need to parse an Excel file with Python.

567
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,739
And of course, there was an example and I took it and

568
00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:43,420
I copied and pasted it

569
00:24:44,069 --> 00:24:44,780
and then

570
00:24:44,969 --> 00:24:48,599
I needed to basically there was a bug in the, in the library.

571
00:24:48,609 --> 00:24:51,569
It wasn't doing something the right way. I forget what it even was.

572
00:24:51,579 --> 00:24:53,099
And so I go to the project and

573
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:56,280
it hadn't been updated in like seven years. I'm like, oh boy,

574
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,660
like this is literally critical infrastructure now

575
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,300
and then. But anyway, that led me on the path of, oh, this project is dead.

576
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,579
This other project

577
00:25:05,685 --> 00:25:09,905
is maintained and proper and it took me a day and I, I converted everything.

578
00:25:09,915 --> 00:25:12,604
But yeah, like that's one of those instances. I,

579
00:25:12,915 --> 00:25:17,494
I had no idea because I was just like sucking down some open source and using it,

580
00:25:17,505 --> 00:25:17,905
you know,

581
00:25:18,114 --> 00:25:20,834
and you were lucky though you're in the Python world where quite

582
00:25:20,844 --> 00:25:24,425
often there is more than one option for reading Excel files or

583
00:25:24,765 --> 00:25:25,435
PDF to

584
00:25:25,685 --> 00:25:26,255
HTML.

585
00:25:26,494 --> 00:25:26,594
There's

586
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:27,905
only one option.

587
00:25:28,344 --> 00:25:30,665
-- Well,
-- now there's, there's one best of breed all

588
00:25:30,984 --> 00:25:31,155
dead.

589
00:25:31,285 --> 00:25:31,895
One in the

590
00:25:32,145 --> 00:25:32,305
Alive.

591
00:25:33,329 --> 00:25:33,680
Yeah.

592
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:37,339
But I mean, a lot of people don't even have that option with their software.

593
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:37,699
You know,

594
00:25:37,709 --> 00:25:39,589
there's a lot of things where somebody wrote one of

595
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:41,180
it and why would anybody else write another one?

596
00:25:41,329 --> 00:25:44,079
So that I, like I said, I think it boils down to the

597
00:25:44,369 --> 00:25:47,079
CSA guidance is just it's like talking about how to

598
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:50,750
breed horses better when we're entering the 19 forties.

599
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,420
-- And it's like the car era.
-- I mean,

600
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:52,949
yeah,

601
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:53,800
I agree.

602
00:25:54,859 --> 00:25:59,209
If you're, let's say you, you run their framework and then they call it t

603
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,099
check, I tried to run it. I couldn't get it to work. Right.

604
00:26:02,109 --> 00:26:04,859
-- And I gave up because I couldn't be bothered just
-- looking at this,

605
00:26:04,869 --> 00:26:08,380
everything I use would fail it because everything I use has like one developer

606
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,380
and that's my point, right? That's my point. Let's say

607
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:12,660
you run this

608
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:15,500
and a bunch of your software scores zero.

609
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:20,180
What are you, what, what's step two like, well, just don't run it again.

610
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,160
Yeah,

611
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:21,939
like

612
00:26:22,069 --> 00:26:25,530
I love that. I'm using this Leper Chat A I front end and it uses a post Gras

613
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,660
docker container that's like kind of really out of date, but like who cares?

614
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:31,780
It only talks to

615
00:26:32,069 --> 00:26:34,099
it through one internal service and like,

616
00:26:34,109 --> 00:26:36,209
I'm not gonna ask the developer to update it because it's

617
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,079
like who cares pointless?

618
00:26:38,189 --> 00:26:40,719
-- Or
-- you could update it for them Kurt,

619
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,319
but it doesn't matter,

620
00:26:42,449 --> 00:26:43,510
then stop complaining.

621
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:44,069
Well,

622
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:45,640
but or I could spend that time writing

623
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,790
backup documentation that would actually benefit people.

624
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:48,089
It's fair.

625
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,400
I have a good example of this actually.

626
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,640
So a long time ago I worked at a little

627
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,719
ISP and I'm pretty sure I've told this story before,

628
00:26:54,969 --> 00:26:58,680
but I decided I was like, starting my security journey

629
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:00,819
and I thought I'm gonna run,

630
00:27:01,689 --> 00:27:04,300
I think it was just called crack back in, back then

631
00:27:04,969 --> 00:27:06,660
crack. Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

632
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:10,420
I'm going to run crack against the password file and we're going to tell

633
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:14,859
all the people who have terrible passwords that they should change their password.

634
00:27:14,869 --> 00:27:16,060
-- Why
-- would
-- you do that?

635
00:27:16,189 --> 00:27:21,359
-- Why?
-- Because I was a burgeoning security nerd. It felt like something we should do.

636
00:27:21,369 --> 00:27:23,670
And honestly, back in the olden days, there was no two of a,

637
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,579
there was no M fa there was none of that.

638
00:27:25,589 --> 00:27:27,339
-- So,
-- no, no. Right. Right.

639
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:31,510
And so anyway, we had 9000 user accounts at

640
00:27:31,709 --> 00:27:32,780
this ISP

641
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:37,640
and we had, I think, like 1500 hits in the first day.

642
00:27:38,719 --> 00:27:42,099
That's it in a day on like crappy hardware.

643
00:27:42,339 --> 00:27:44,479
But anyway, we got all these hits

644
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,530
and then I'm like, what do we do now?

645
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:51,219
And this is, and I was like, turn it off, delete the data. We're never doing this again

646
00:27:51,489 --> 00:27:52,459
because it was like,

647
00:27:52,469 --> 00:27:56,239
this is the company knew they could not handle the support burden,

648
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,849
asking 1500 people to change their passwords.

649
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:02,949
And so the solution was to stick our head in the sand and not do anything about it,

650
00:28:02,979 --> 00:28:05,650
not even the support burden, but you would just piss them all off.

651
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,010
That's true. You'd probably lose some of those customers.

652
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,489
-- Why
-- did you look at my password? I thought you said my password was secure.

653
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,839
That's true. That's a good point.

654
00:28:12,849 --> 00:28:15,650
I didn't even think of that angle and, but anyway, here's my point. Right.

655
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:19,489
And I think this is how I'm going to sum up my final thoughts on this whole thing.

656
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:22,430
I think the guidance Sisa created

657
00:28:22,689 --> 00:28:26,430
is we'll say what feels like doing something.

658
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:28,829
And I think in the world of security sometimes

659
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:32,619
we do things to feel like we're doing something,

660
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:37,430
-- but sometimes that is actually worse than nothing.
-- The goalkeeper's dilemma.

661
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,109
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah, exactly.

662
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:40,589
So, statistically

663
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,520
what's the best thing to do as a goalkeeper

664
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:44,430
in soccer is to basically stand your ground?

665
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,349
Yeah, stand still.

666
00:28:45,536 --> 00:28:48,446
But if you do that, the crowd will set you on fire and you'll lose your job.

667
00:28:48,495 --> 00:28:51,385
Well, I I'm less worried about that if I'm on fire

668
00:28:51,656 --> 00:28:53,656
and not a hypothetical example, right?

669
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:55,526
Like some countries take this very seriously.

670
00:28:55,765 --> 00:28:56,395
That's fair.

671
00:28:56,576 --> 00:28:57,885
I would say it's actually,

672
00:28:57,895 --> 00:29:00,985
I think for me it's a very subtle thing of SISA is looking

673
00:29:00,995 --> 00:29:04,686
at open source from the perspective of there's all this negative stuff,

674
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:07,235
do stuff so that you can avoid the negative.

675
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,365
And the White House is looking at this saying there's all

676
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:11,781
this open source and there's a whole bunch of positive stuff.

677
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,222
Embrace that and lean into it.

678
00:29:13,411 --> 00:29:19,182
Yeah, I think that's fair. A basic fact of life is no amount of avoiding the bad stuff.

679
00:29:19,192 --> 00:29:21,982
Like no amount of not doing something will get

680
00:29:21,991 --> 00:29:24,702
you in shape or a happier human being like,

681
00:29:24,712 --> 00:29:28,062
yeah, not smoking is a good thing, but like you have to exercise,

682
00:29:28,072 --> 00:29:31,842
you have to eat better, you have to make actual positive engagement.

683
00:29:31,852 --> 00:29:36,141
Like no amount of avoiding bad air codes, bad open source

684
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:41,829
will result in me participating and helping build better open source. That's it.

685
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:42,880
And I mean,

686
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,530
honestly, here's the thing.

687
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:48,109
Imagine if 10,000 people across the federal government, which is not a lot.

688
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:50,609
Right. The federal government in the US is pretty big.

689
00:29:50,619 --> 00:29:55,510
I don't know, let's look us federal government employees.

690
00:29:55,609 --> 00:29:56,729
It's about 2 to 3 million,

691
00:29:56,829 --> 00:30:00,500
it says about two and a quarter million civilian personnel,

692
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,770
civilian.

693
00:30:01,859 --> 00:30:04,180
So you've also got the dod, you've got all the law enforcement,

694
00:30:04,276 --> 00:30:06,956
it says two and a quarter million military personnel.

695
00:30:07,326 --> 00:30:09,605
Well, regardless, 10,000 people is

696
00:30:09,715 --> 00:30:12,656
-- a doable number. Yeah,
-- 10 1000 is a rounding error.

697
00:30:12,666 --> 00:30:17,485
And imagine if those 10,000 people each spent 10 hours a year, not a month,

698
00:30:17,495 --> 00:30:18,786
not a week a year

699
00:30:18,946 --> 00:30:22,765
-- helping improve an open source project.
-- That would be remarkable for sure.

700
00:30:23,395 --> 00:30:25,645
And, and not just the government, here's the thing.

701
00:30:25,826 --> 00:30:26,135
Yeah,

702
00:30:26,265 --> 00:30:29,196
if the White House releases this sort of guidance,

703
00:30:29,385 --> 00:30:31,956
the private sector is also going to pay attention,

704
00:30:32,761 --> 00:30:33,161
right?

705
00:30:33,232 --> 00:30:35,921
And I think that's part of this is we also need

706
00:30:35,932 --> 00:30:40,932
these big companies to stop treating open source like a liability

707
00:30:41,112 --> 00:30:44,501
and start trying to get involved in some meaningful way.

708
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:48,421
Like I said, embracing the positive and engaging and doing something positive,

709
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:51,541
like no amount of not littering is going to help build a new park in your city.

710
00:30:51,552 --> 00:30:52,141
You know, like

711
00:30:52,432 --> 00:30:52,741
if

712
00:30:53,011 --> 00:30:57,011
I, I think it's starting to shift because quite frankly,

713
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,682
one thing I've noticed and you've probably noticed this but never thought about it

714
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:03,069
is the companies and organizations and especially the start

715
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:06,709
ups that really engage actively with open source.

716
00:31:06,719 --> 00:31:09,449
Quite often do a lot better than the ones that don't.

717
00:31:09,459 --> 00:31:11,260
And obviously there are ones that just strip mind the

718
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,790
heck out of open source and do just fine.

719
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,680
That happens

720
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,760
one caveat to that.

721
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:18,359
I would also point out is those things are often big enough that they

722
00:31:18,369 --> 00:31:21,930
sort of do the engagement internally and don't return it to the public.

723
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:24,189
So they do get the benefit of internal

724
00:31:24,293 --> 00:31:27,744
like that synergy well or whatever the firm is like where

725
00:31:27,754 --> 00:31:30,104
I improve something 1% he improved something 1% you know,

726
00:31:30,114 --> 00:31:32,293
stone soup and we get this thing that's massively better.

727
00:31:32,894 --> 00:31:36,504
And like Amazon Apple, Microsoft all do this

728
00:31:36,614 --> 00:31:37,534
internally

729
00:31:37,663 --> 00:31:40,173
and some of them like Microsoft are also starting to return

730
00:31:40,183 --> 00:31:43,073
it back to the community with some pretty good results.

731
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:44,843
-- I
-- think if you look at

732
00:31:45,114 --> 00:31:48,484
a number of large companies, I mean, there's a lot of organizations

733
00:31:48,738 --> 00:31:50,267
doing a lot of really good public work.

734
00:31:50,277 --> 00:31:54,157
I mean, Google and Microsoft, even Amazon to a degree has been doing quite a bit.

735
00:31:54,167 --> 00:31:56,238
There's a bunch of banks that have been doing a lot. I mean,

736
00:31:56,527 --> 00:31:59,037
there are plenty of companies you can look at for

737
00:31:59,047 --> 00:32:00,917
good examples of how to do this right now.

738
00:32:00,927 --> 00:32:03,437
Granted, I also recognize that like any big company,

739
00:32:03,447 --> 00:32:05,267
I'm sure for every person doing it right.

740
00:32:05,277 --> 00:32:08,267
There's one or more people screwing it up.

741
00:32:08,557 --> 00:32:12,677
I would have never guessed this guess. Ok. So there's two sites of data for the Linux

742
00:32:12,862 --> 00:32:16,302
uh 6.1 kernel. There's the by chain sets and bylines changed.

743
00:32:16,432 --> 00:32:19,572
So looking at by change sets, not lines, but by chain sets.

744
00:32:19,852 --> 00:32:23,541
-- What is the top company
-- if I had to guess right now?

745
00:32:23,972 --> 00:32:27,592
-- I bet. Is it, is it arm or Intel? Not
-- even close? Huawei.

746
00:32:27,911 --> 00:32:28,222
Huawei.

747
00:32:28,932 --> 00:32:30,041
-- Oh, yeah. Ok. I buy
-- that

748
00:32:30,452 --> 00:32:30,822
but

749
00:32:30,972 --> 00:32:37,041
-- 9.2% Intel at nine unknown at
-- eight. OK. I was close. I was close. You said way off.

750
00:32:37,145 --> 00:32:39,166
-- Come on. Uh well,
-- Google Lena

751
00:32:39,485 --> 00:32:43,086
A MD Red Hat, Meta and video souza oracle

752
00:32:43,225 --> 00:32:47,206
NXP semiconductor at 2%. That's, I've never even heard of them.

753
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:50,765
That does not surprise me in any way. They're probably building socks.

754
00:32:50,865 --> 00:32:55,255
And, and if you look at my lines changed, it's oracle A MD, Google Intel. Unknown.

755
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:58,125
Real tech. Yeah. Real tech has a lot of drivers, I bet. Yeah.

756
00:32:58,276 --> 00:32:58,696
Yeah. Yeah.

757
00:32:58,895 --> 00:32:59,615
But yeah, like

758
00:33:00,265 --> 00:33:01,245
it's, it's

759
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,819
big companies like big boring.

760
00:33:03,829 --> 00:33:07,670
-- We make stuff companies because
-- like the Linux kernel is the best.

761
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,030
I mean, Linux won.

762
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:10,160
Yeah.

763
00:33:11,069 --> 00:33:12,760
All right, we need to end this one. So

764
00:33:12,869 --> 00:33:15,420
I, like I said, I think all of this

765
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,790
and I think this is true for security.

766
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,510
All of this security that boils down to trying to slap people

767
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,939
on the wrist and make them not do the bad thing.

768
00:33:21,949 --> 00:33:24,040
Like the whole phishing email training thing.

769
00:33:24,209 --> 00:33:24,699
No,

770
00:33:24,829 --> 00:33:28,520
make it so that like their computer works properly and clicking a link doesn't

771
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:32,319
result in all of your money being sent to some random person in Macau

772
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:36,619
and make sure they're not afraid to come tell you if they do make a mistake.

773
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:38,579
That's a huge other part of that.

774
00:33:39,369 --> 00:33:39,900
Or

775
00:33:40,469 --> 00:33:42,550
to ask even because I think some places they're so

776
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,170
hostile that even just asking you get in trouble for,

777
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:45,640
right?

778
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,010
Which is the correct thing to do.

779
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:50,260
You don't punish somebody for saying, hey, this invoice looks a little

780
00:33:50,469 --> 00:33:52,719
like we get that all the time where we get these wonky invoices.

781
00:33:52,729 --> 00:33:56,849
-- And I'm like, I google it and I'm like, oh, this is totally a scam.
-- So it's very funny.

782
00:33:56,859 --> 00:33:59,930
I, I make our, our awareness training every year at, at Anor

783
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:03,810
because I hate, I've, I've tried to find something that's like appallingly bad.

784
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,439
And I would say 80% of the training,

785
00:34:06,449 --> 00:34:09,168
I think just boils down to just please come and ask me

786
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:13,080
if something seems weird like the end of every slide is that.

787
00:34:13,228 --> 00:34:17,139
And I think 90% of that is just like pause, take a breath and think for a moment.

788
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:20,520
But on the other side, lots of people come and ask me questions now.

789
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:23,129
And I'm like, and I even tell them, I don't care how

790
00:34:23,245 --> 00:34:24,425
dumb you think it is.

791
00:34:24,655 --> 00:34:26,083
-- Yep.
-- Come to me with it. Oh,

792
00:34:26,094 --> 00:34:27,625
the same thing with security reports.

793
00:34:27,635 --> 00:34:30,333
-- Like I would rather 100 false positives.
-- That's awesome.

794
00:34:30,344 --> 00:34:32,813
All right, I'm ending the show. All right. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you for listening.
