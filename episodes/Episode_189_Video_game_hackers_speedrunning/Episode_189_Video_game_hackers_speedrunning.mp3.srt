Hello and welcome to episode Thursday of

1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,250
the open source security podcast with myself,

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,779
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime Josh Pressers.

3
00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:14,090
I mean, that's one way to do it.

4
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:15,810
So dear listener,

5
00:00:15,819 --> 00:00:19,250
we are going to stop saying the episode number

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,829
during Kurt's intro because I've been publishing some things

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,450
out of order and it's an enormous pain in my butt to open up a bunch of audio files

8
00:00:27,863 --> 00:00:30,333
out the correct episode number, paste it in,

9
00:00:30,382 --> 00:00:32,882
make the audio sound correct because obviously you can

10
00:00:32,893 --> 00:00:34,902
imagine when you record on different days you get different

11
00:00:34,912 --> 00:00:39,772
quality and I'm tired of it and I give up so no more episode numbers in the intro.

12
00:00:39,783 --> 00:00:41,022
Maybe we should just have like,

13
00:00:41,143 --> 00:00:41,152
oh,

14
00:00:41,263 --> 00:00:44,362
what's that like? Text to speech service that Amazon has.

15
00:00:44,373 --> 00:00:45,573
Maybe we should just use that.

16
00:00:45,673 --> 00:00:47,842
No, I'm not doing that.

17
00:00:47,952 --> 00:00:49,842
Those sound terrible. Everyone.

18
00:00:50,006 --> 00:00:50,026
So

19
00:00:50,476 --> 00:00:51,355
no more,

20
00:00:51,486 --> 00:00:53,655
no more episode numbers.

21
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:56,355
Which is unfortunate because we won't talk about prime numbers,

22
00:00:56,366 --> 00:00:59,756
but we could just talk about a number if we saw Desire.

23
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,375
Thursday is a prime I believe.

24
00:01:01,585 --> 00:01:02,616
Is it why not?

25
00:01:04,715 --> 00:01:07,066
It's a better off ted reference that I tickled.

26
00:01:07,585 --> 00:01:07,816
I've

27
00:01:08,255 --> 00:01:08,386
never

28
00:01:08,536 --> 00:01:10,375
seen that also. I just googled Ted

29
00:01:10,555 --> 00:01:11,195
Space F

30
00:01:11,295 --> 00:01:12,096
Thursday and

31
00:01:12,349 --> 00:01:13,250
the results

32
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:20,459
are odd. I, I just, to our listeners, you should definitely Google Ted Space Furs.

33
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,599
A Flursdayii. I, yeah,

34
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,019
I'm gonna, I'm going to do this. Like, it's just all over the place.

35
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:31,300
The first thing I get is a florist.

36
00:01:31,339 --> 00:01:36,250
I'm getting parliamentary debate results followed by

37
00:01:36,669 --> 00:01:39,169
some gardening related content,

38
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,809
followed by some newspapers from the 19 seventies.

39
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,370
I have no idea what's going on here. This is the strangest Google results

40
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:51,330
I have ever seen. I'm going, I will investigate this and see what I can come up with.

41
00:01:51,339 --> 00:01:51,650
But

42
00:01:51,919 --> 00:01:52,940
my suspicion,

43
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:57,099
oh, you know what, bad OCR because it's all books dot Google dot C A results.

44
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,940
That's what you're getting. Yes, that would make sense. That's fair.

45
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:00,839
Yeah,

46
00:02:00,949 --> 00:02:02,769
this is ok. This is Thursday.

47
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:06,610
Yeah, this is Thursday getting mangled and you spelled it flur.

48
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:06,970
Yeah.

49
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,380
Ok. Yeah. Yeah.

50
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:12,440
Well, and you figure Google has the technology to do kind of, you know,

51
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:14,279
fuzzy matching where it assumes.

52
00:02:14,289 --> 00:02:15,940
Oh, maybe you spelled the word wrong.

53
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,929
I'm going to look up things that are similarly spelled

54
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:19,740
to this.

55
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,339
Thursday is not a word.

56
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:24,029
Everything is a word.

57
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,690
If the internet should teach you anything, it's, that everything is a word.

58
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:32,229
Actually, there was a local radio station one time that did a contest which was,

59
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:36,240
can you type two English words into Google and only get one result.

60
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,110
And I don't think anyone could do it. Yeah.

61
00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:41,990
The, the, the, what, what are those called Google Lottery or whatever?

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,210
Yeah, I remember this is back in the day and because there was a couple I could type in,

63
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,130
uh, that would end up on my documentation.

64
00:02:47,869 --> 00:02:48,990
Right. Ok. Yeah. Yeah.

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,399
Well, this is kind of related to today's topic which is speed runs.

66
00:02:52,669 --> 00:02:52,839
Yeah,

67
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,190
we're going to talk about video games again because I'm sick

68
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,529
of all anyone talks about is bad news and screw that.

69
00:02:58,539 --> 00:03:01,869
So we're going to talk about hacking video games, which is also very speed running.

70
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,410
Well.

71
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:04,559
Ah, but this is what I find interesting is,

72
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:09,339
is if you look at a lot of the speed runs videos, they're, they're not,

73
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,210
I wouldn't consider it hacking

74
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:12,710
because it's not like they're,

75
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,119
they're actually like patching the game or modifying the game in any way or even

76
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,979
some of them do. But I'm saying, like, a lot of them are straight up.

77
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,559
You sit down, like, for example,

78
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,470
at a console here's the controller and the guy does stuff.

79
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,860
And what I love is,

80
00:03:25,869 --> 00:03:28,059
and because you were mentioning this too is there's a whole

81
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,750
bunch of youtube videos where it's not just a speed run,

82
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:34,419
but it's developers of that game watching the speed run going on.

83
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:38,059
Yeah, we didn't. Wow. Like that's messed up. It's so much fun.

84
00:03:38,779 --> 00:03:42,100
Start at the beginning because I think we love to get

85
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,470
ahead of ourselves every time we talk and that's fine.

86
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,009
So I'm going to assume everyone knows what video games are

87
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,399
and I'm not going to assume everyone knows what speed running is because this is a,

88
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,770
I would say in the last couple of years, it's become much more popular than it was.

89
00:03:55,779 --> 00:03:58,360
It's been around for at least a decade, probably longer.

90
00:03:58,369 --> 00:04:02,360
I've never heard of it in public or I've let me put it this way.

91
00:04:02,369 --> 00:04:05,360
The only people I know that talk about this are like you and TJ,

92
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:08,509
that's fair. I talk about it a lot.

93
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,130
So if you know me, I've talked to you about speed running, I guarantee it.

94
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:15,419
So essentially what happens is everyone's familiar with video

95
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:18,600
games and the idea being you start playing the game

96
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,910
and there's some logical conclusion to the game

97
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,779
in most games, you beat the end boss,

98
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,959
there's games where it could be beating a score or I mean,

99
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,510
like Minecraft is a great example where like the end of Minecraft is squishy.

100
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,489
So what does that mean?

101
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,679
Well, originally it's, you beat the Ender Dragon at the end that there's

102
00:04:35,907 --> 00:04:36,578
Yeah, sure.

103
00:04:36,588 --> 00:04:38,507
But the problem with Minecraft is there's so many,

104
00:04:38,518 --> 00:04:40,937
it's bifurcated and there's so many different versions now, right?

105
00:04:40,988 --> 00:04:44,838
And so what happens in speed running is the idea is

106
00:04:44,977 --> 00:04:49,638
how can I get from the start of the game to the end of the game as fast as possible?

107
00:04:49,648 --> 00:04:52,458
And we should probably mention that

108
00:04:52,717 --> 00:04:55,578
what qualifies the end of the game

109
00:04:55,798 --> 00:04:57,097
in some cases is like,

110
00:04:57,108 --> 00:04:59,898
what you would consider to be classically completing the game.

111
00:04:59,907 --> 00:05:02,548
And in some games it's they consider that getting to

112
00:05:02,558 --> 00:05:04,618
like the final screen that says like well done.

113
00:05:04,696 --> 00:05:08,596
You did it right? Because there's some games you can get to glitch out

114
00:05:08,936 --> 00:05:10,895
well and they even have different categories.

115
00:05:10,906 --> 00:05:14,626
So I will pick on Super Mario World as one of my

116
00:05:14,635 --> 00:05:17,805
favorite examples here where this is a game on the Super Nintendo.

117
00:05:17,816 --> 00:05:21,865
If you've never played it, you're totally missing out. It's an amazing fun game.

118
00:05:21,876 --> 00:05:25,526
It is one of my favorites. It is so good. I love that game so much.

119
00:05:25,545 --> 00:05:28,566
And there are kind of a couple of different ways to beat it.

120
00:05:28,575 --> 00:05:33,165
And so you can just go right to the end boss to Bowser, beat him and that,

121
00:05:33,175 --> 00:05:34,134
that's one way right.

122
00:05:34,144 --> 00:05:36,894
There's beating all of the levels and then beating Bowser,

123
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:39,454
there's getting to the end credit screen.

124
00:05:39,463 --> 00:05:42,294
And I say that because some people found a bug that

125
00:05:42,303 --> 00:05:45,854
lets you create arbitrary code execution in Super Mario world.

126
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:47,334
Oh, and it crashes or something?

127
00:05:48,343 --> 00:05:51,873
Well, they, they basically, they, they figured out where the like

128
00:05:52,063 --> 00:05:55,204
the the program is that runs the end credits

129
00:05:55,473 --> 00:05:59,854
and they cause arbitrary code execution to jump to that instruction.

130
00:05:59,864 --> 00:06:03,391
Like there's actually a really, really good explaination video on youtube.

131
00:06:03,402 --> 00:06:06,182
I will link to in the show notes that talks about how they do this,

132
00:06:06,191 --> 00:06:07,712
how they overwrite all the data.

133
00:06:07,721 --> 00:06:08,511
And it's like,

134
00:06:08,622 --> 00:06:11,391
and to be clear, they're doing this like with like the standard controller,

135
00:06:11,402 --> 00:06:12,101
like they're not hooking

136
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:12,312
up.

137
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:13,191
And

138
00:06:13,682 --> 00:06:16,421
so basically what happens is they get on Yoshi,

139
00:06:16,432 --> 00:06:20,462
they cause like a glitch state in the game and then they placed all these items around

140
00:06:20,471 --> 00:06:22,861
the level that writes memory in certain locations

141
00:06:22,872 --> 00:06:25,191
that by doing a certain action with Yoshi,

142
00:06:25,212 --> 00:06:28,552
you basically cause the game to jump into the

143
00:06:28,562 --> 00:06:31,321
X and Y coordinates of items you have placed

144
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,529
in the game which then jumps to the end credits. It's completely insane.

145
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,829
So they basically invented return oriented programming in a video game

146
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,140
actually

147
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:44,649
really

148
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:48,739
impressive. It's amazing. And so in fact, this has been really topical lately.

149
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,529
If if you, if you read Reddit, you would have noticed this has been a huge topic for

150
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:56,089
the game legend of Zelda Ocarina of time

151
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,220
because they actually recently achieved arbitrary code execution.

152
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,268
And in a way humans can do it

153
00:07:02,477 --> 00:07:04,657
because historically, it's been one of those, you know,

154
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:07,278
only a task can do it because you have to push the, you know, a million buttons,

155
00:07:07,287 --> 00:07:08,347
a second type thing.

156
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:10,937
But they found a way that a human being with a

157
00:07:10,947 --> 00:07:14,828
controller can do these actions and then make ocarina of time,

158
00:07:14,838 --> 00:07:15,358
do anything.

159
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,347
And of course, in their, in the instance of speed runners,

160
00:07:17,358 --> 00:07:19,067
they're just jumping to the end credits.

161
00:07:19,078 --> 00:07:22,708
But it doesn't mean you have to, there's actually there's another video from

162
00:07:22,928 --> 00:07:26,268
uh it was uh one of the games done quick. I forget which one I will try to find it.

163
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:28,787
But they basically took Mario three. They

164
00:07:29,186 --> 00:07:31,686
started in arbitrary code execution flaw

165
00:07:31,976 --> 00:07:34,325
and then they reprogrammed the game. And

166
00:07:35,006 --> 00:07:39,885
it's absolutely amazing what they did here because, and this was task, right?

167
00:07:39,895 --> 00:07:42,305
This wasn't a human when I say, OK, if I say task,

168
00:07:42,316 --> 00:07:43,876
that's called tool assisted speed run.

169
00:07:43,885 --> 00:07:44,825
And that's where like

170
00:07:44,925 --> 00:07:47,846
you plug a computer into the controller port and

171
00:07:47,855 --> 00:07:50,385
the computer can push the buttons at ridiculous speeds.

172
00:07:50,395 --> 00:07:54,955
But anyway, they like they reprogrammed Mario three to do crazy things. And it's,

173
00:07:55,415 --> 00:07:57,966
it's so wild anyway. But the point is

174
00:07:58,084 --> 00:08:00,824
this is a fascinating topic because it's fun

175
00:08:01,044 --> 00:08:05,634
and it is essentially hacking video games in almost every instance there are,

176
00:08:05,644 --> 00:08:08,444
there are speed runs that do not do

177
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:10,694
what I would call hacking where you're leveraging bugs

178
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,463
and you're causing, you know, arbitrary code execution or whatever.

179
00:08:13,473 --> 00:08:15,364
But the vast majority of them

180
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:16,223
do

181
00:08:16,394 --> 00:08:19,463
this exact thing. My favorite was I was watching this one speed run video

182
00:08:19,634 --> 00:08:22,144
and the developer was like, he's just running past the God guys.

183
00:08:22,153 --> 00:08:23,093
He's not shooting them.

184
00:08:23,593 --> 00:08:24,584
It's like, well,

185
00:08:24,794 --> 00:08:25,493
yeah, because

186
00:08:25,653 --> 00:08:26,864
you don't need to

187
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:31,049
like unless they drop something, some loot item that you need to complete the game.

188
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:31,179
Yeah.

189
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,460
You know, like,

190
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,929
and so it was interesting is this,

191
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,340
this speed run basically was predicated on getting healed a

192
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:39,669
lot because you got shot a lot and you just,

193
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,130
like, ran through the game.

194
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:44,510
I know which one you, I forget the name of the game. It's a fairly new game.

195
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,789
And actually that one they had the developer, I think was at games done

196
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,289
quick when they ran it and it was,

197
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:52,760
yeah, it's fascinating because the developers just never

198
00:08:53,052 --> 00:08:56,002
imagine someone would do this. And, I mean, but here's the thing, right?

199
00:08:56,013 --> 00:08:59,932
And this is why I love this topic in the security context is,

200
00:09:00,143 --> 00:09:01,523
I mean, what are security bugs?

201
00:09:01,643 --> 00:09:01,752
You're

202
00:09:01,872 --> 00:09:01,922
not

203
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:02,093
supposed

204
00:09:02,263 --> 00:09:02,283
to

205
00:09:02,432 --> 00:09:02,853
do that?

206
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:07,242
Right. Exactly. Why would anyone do that? And, and I have a great story I always tell.

207
00:09:07,252 --> 00:09:10,083
So my first job out of college was

208
00:09:10,093 --> 00:09:12,393
for this company that wrote life insurance software.

209
00:09:12,603 --> 00:09:18,825
And I remember they were, we used some ridiculously old database on the back end.

210
00:09:18,835 --> 00:09:19,955
It was one of those like bree

211
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,296
style databases, you know,

212
00:09:21,306 --> 00:09:25,135
key value pairs and they were rewriting the application to use SQL.

213
00:09:25,145 --> 00:09:28,116
And I remember at one point they had any time

214
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,676
a company makes like a fundamental technology switch like that.

215
00:09:30,685 --> 00:09:33,096
I just, you know, I want to go find a bottle of liquor.

216
00:09:33,645 --> 00:09:35,116
That's exactly what happened.

217
00:09:35,349 --> 00:09:39,650
But anyway, so I remember we, we had the login screen

218
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,330
and in, in the old system, there wasn't even logins,

219
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,700
like if you had a computer hooked up to

220
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,960
the system because it ran in like freaking mainframes,

221
00:09:46,969 --> 00:09:49,669
like you were just, your security was physical and it was

222
00:09:50,099 --> 00:09:51,659
because everybody had, and this, I

223
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,340
think part of it too is this a lot of people remember this

224
00:09:54,619 --> 00:09:58,520
back in the day, people had offices and those offices had locked doors. Exactly.

225
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,000
Exactly. So anyway,

226
00:10:00,104 --> 00:10:05,674
we are rewriting this to, to work with the SQL server and they have the log in and I,

227
00:10:05,684 --> 00:10:07,344
I did a sequel injection on the login.

228
00:10:07,354 --> 00:10:10,044
I'm like, look at this and I remember the developer looked at me and said,

229
00:10:10,054 --> 00:10:11,224
why would anyone do that?

230
00:10:11,325 --> 00:10:16,094
I'm like, I just did that. And what's funny is you're making a login screen.

231
00:10:16,104 --> 00:10:20,205
So ostensibly you're making the promise or the contract that

232
00:10:20,255 --> 00:10:22,945
you have to have a valid user name and password.

233
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,765
I'm assuming it's a user name and password to get in.

234
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:27,409
Yeah. Right. And yeah, and then the developer is like, I don't get it.

235
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:31,809
Why would that be a problem? You're building something to explicitly handle,

236
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:33,760
you know, to enforce a condition.

237
00:10:34,109 --> 00:10:36,409
Josh just showed you how to bypass that condition.

238
00:10:36,979 --> 00:10:38,119
It's like every time I, you know,

239
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,489
when you're driving on the road and you see like

240
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,890
mashed up guard rails that haven't been replaced yet,

241
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,330
you know, it makes me kind of nervous because

242
00:10:43,849 --> 00:10:46,510
a that guard rail was put there for probably a good reason and b

243
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,150
clearly was put there for a good reason because now it's all mashed up.

244
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:52,849
So like we should probably replace that one would think. But, but anyway, right,

245
00:10:52,989 --> 00:10:57,219
the the attitude is you have developers building something

246
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:01,369
and they assume people are going to act with, with good intent.

247
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,979
And in the case of obviously computer security,

248
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:07,710
the bad intent often leads to bad consequences.

249
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:10,239
But in the case of most of these video game speed runs,

250
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,140
the bad intent leads to awesome speed runs

251
00:11:13,244 --> 00:11:13,414
well.

252
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:14,125
And in fairness too,

253
00:11:14,135 --> 00:11:15,734
there's a lot of games that kind of suck

254
00:11:15,744 --> 00:11:17,924
because they try and force you through a certain,

255
00:11:17,934 --> 00:11:19,224
you know, sequence of events.

256
00:11:19,234 --> 00:11:21,784
And I get that like 20 years ago, like, remember the original, you know,

257
00:11:21,794 --> 00:11:26,205
Doom or the original Half Life where, you know, you had to go do this,

258
00:11:26,215 --> 00:11:26,885
flip this button.

259
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,905
Get the rocket to fire, blah, blah, blah. I kind of get that.

260
00:11:28,914 --> 00:11:31,705
But then there's more modern games where it's like you have to like,

261
00:11:32,085 --> 00:11:32,094
oh,

262
00:11:32,215 --> 00:11:34,465
there's a penny arcade comic, but you have to, like,

263
00:11:34,474 --> 00:11:37,585
you have to go through duct work and actually make a noise to alert a bad guy.

264
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,044
And, you know, it's kind of the joke is, but I'm playing like a ninja character.

265
00:11:40,054 --> 00:11:42,395
Why can't I, like, sneak past it, drop down and cut his throat.

266
00:11:43,349 --> 00:11:44,570
Right. Right. Right.

267
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,960
And I think some of the newer games

268
00:11:46,969 --> 00:11:50,130
are getting more interesting in that regard where they're

269
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,650
way more open and you can do far

270
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:55,130
more interesting things than you necessarily could before.

271
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:55,640
And one of my,

272
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:59,729
so my favorite example of this actually is the legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild,

273
00:11:59,739 --> 00:12:01,400
which is on the Nintendo Switch.

274
00:12:01,409 --> 00:12:02,520
And if you've never played it,

275
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:05,349
it is an amazing game for a variety of reasons

276
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:07,090
and I'm not going to Fanboy on it too much.

277
00:12:07,099 --> 00:12:08,830
I've seen some pretty crazy videos coming

278
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:09,489
of that game.

279
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,929
Like if you, if you want, right, he basically just built this huge physics engine.

280
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:17,599
And like my favorite example actually is my, my son figured this out.

281
00:12:17,609 --> 00:12:21,179
There's these puzzles where you have to like hold the controller and move it in,

282
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:24,739
in space because like literally it's got the gyroscope inside of it.

283
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,979
And as you move the controller, it moves a platform

284
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,340
on the screen. OK?

285
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:32,299
And like you have a ball in a maze sort of game, right where you have to move it.

286
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:34,539
And he figured out if he just flips the controller upside down,

287
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:34,669
uh

288
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:37,419
The bottom of the maze is flat, right?

289
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,830
You could just roll it to the end. I'm like, that's amazing.

290
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:44,630
I never would have thought of that. And yeah, like there you go, you just choose it.

291
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,530
And all of a sudden pu

292
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:48,789
what goes for? Actually a really hard puzzle is now a joke

293
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,869
and the game is full of stuff like this where you can just,

294
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,669
you can do crazy things and the speed runners abuse this

295
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:57,340
where so you're obviously you're supposed to start the game,

296
00:12:57,349 --> 00:12:58,750
you play the game, you get your weapons,

297
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,270
you get your power ups and then you go beat the, em.

298
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:04,429
Well, it turns out if you can get to the end boss, you can basically defeat him.

299
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,440
So they basically show up naked with the exact weapons they need to defeat it. I'm,

300
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,719
I'm totally serious. These people have like, no armor.

301
00:13:11,729 --> 00:13:14,039
They show up and they, they have

302
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,830
like, they literally, they, if they, if they miss a hit,

303
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,179
they die because they have it exactly choreographed

304
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,549
and they can do it in under half an

305
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:25,250
hour and it took me like 200 hours to beat this game when I did it.

306
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:25,940
It is

307
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:30,020
well, and that also speaks to me as to making the games a bit more open ended.

308
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,690
And, you know,

309
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,289
like one thing I've seen is kind of that style where it's more like a well like magic,

310
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:36,250
the gathering or pathfinder where, you know,

311
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,679
you have these cards with these traits and these abilities

312
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,520
and you can mix them in new and interesting ways.

313
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,010
Yeah. Right.

314
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,719
And what I like, one thing I love about the game Starcraft,

315
00:13:44,729 --> 00:13:46,719
there's a really good quote at any time.

316
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,849
The game of Starcraft in a specific matchup is unbalanced, but

317
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,400
the game overall is generally quite well balanced because part of it is, you know,

318
00:13:56,409 --> 00:13:59,380
so I remember when battle cruisers came out and then they had the

319
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,840
ability to teleport jump and for a while all these tran players would like

320
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,409
rush two or three battle cruisers out jump them

321
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:07,900
over to the enemies and just destroy them.

322
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,789
But within like, two weeks,

323
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,460
you know, the opposing, basically the people had to deal with this,

324
00:14:12,469 --> 00:14:13,520
figured out how to deal with this.

325
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:14,140
Like, you know,

326
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:17,650
put up some scores to shoot up or get some queens to shoot up or whatever, like,

327
00:14:17,969 --> 00:14:20,809
you know, it, so the game kind of rebalanced because it's like, ok,

328
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,200
there's this strategy that, yeah, if you're not prepared for it absolutely works.

329
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:27,510
But if you know how to react to it, oh, it's, it's actually really easy to deal with.

330
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,869
It's just that, that novelty and that newness where it's like,

331
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,010
what the heck is going on?

332
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,390
Right. I think that's fair. That's

333
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:35,109
true of everything. Right.

334
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:38,190
I mean, attacking, defending our security world, right?

335
00:14:38,289 --> 00:14:39,429
Like, oh, proper overflow,

336
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,140
return oriented programming.

337
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,979
Oh, you know, I remember when XSS came out and everybody's like, what,

338
00:14:43,989 --> 00:14:44,929
why would anybody do that?

339
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,190
I'm like, because they get to control what they show you on the web page. Yeah.

340
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,750
But it,

341
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,570
it took people a while to understand or one of my favorites actually is double freeze

342
00:14:53,729 --> 00:14:57,179
where for the longest time we thought double free issues were only crashes.

343
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:00,510
And then one day solar designer shows up and says, hey, look what I can do.

344
00:15:00,729 --> 00:15:00,940
And

345
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:05,799
all of a sudden we're like, oh, crap. And we had a decade of ignoring these bugs.

346
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:08,750
I remember when, basically I, yeah, I remember

347
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:11,429
that pretty much that week where I was like, well,

348
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,270
these are all getting CV S now and people are arguing with me and I'm like,

349
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:16,109
go look at this posting like that's it.

350
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:17,390
Like, just go read the posting.

351
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,830
I'm giving these CV si understand that you don't like this and you, you,

352
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,539
you whatever, but too bad.

353
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:23,530
These are all,

354
00:15:24,729 --> 00:15:28,190
you know what ruined it for me was learning it and then thinking,

355
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,239
what about all the crap?

356
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:33,080
We said not a bug two years ago now, I've got to go look at it all again.

357
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:36,559
We don't work there anymore. It's not our problem. Not anymore. Well,

358
00:15:36,729 --> 00:15:37,140
that's not true.

359
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,950
I still deal with this stuff all the time, but it's,

360
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,679
it's definitely different for sure.

361
00:15:41,849 --> 00:15:42,359
And,

362
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:45,080
yeah. Yeah. But this was also what, 20 years

363
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,260
more, probably, probably almost 30 years ago, man, it's been a long time.

364
00:15:48,304 --> 00:15:50,934
I don't even remember anymore. It's been long anyway. Anyway.

365
00:15:50,945 --> 00:15:56,294
The point being that it is one of those fascinating games of cat and mouse and

366
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,025
I mean, in all seriousness as well.

367
00:15:58,034 --> 00:16:02,275
So in the speed running world now where you have the ability to update games where,

368
00:16:02,284 --> 00:16:08,044
for example, the Zelda developers are constantly fixing bugs in the Zelda game.

369
00:16:08,054 --> 00:16:09,695
And so there are bugs

370
00:16:09,804 --> 00:16:13,405
and to be clear they're fixing bugs or they rebalancing it. Like are they actually

371
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,530
saying like this behavior should not have existed? We're going to patch around it?

372
00:16:16,539 --> 00:16:18,299
I don't, I don't think it's rebalancing.

373
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:22,489
I think it's legitimately fixing bugs where they, because what,

374
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,659
what you'll see in speed running.

375
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:26,669
And this is even true of the old games like on the Nintendo where they

376
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:32,710
will run the Japanese version of the game because the Japanese version is like 1.0.

377
00:16:32,719 --> 00:16:34,929
And then the version that came out in the United States would be

378
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,580
like version 1.1 and they fixed some of the bugs that were just

379
00:16:38,715 --> 00:16:40,804
covered from the time each version got released.

380
00:16:40,815 --> 00:16:44,775
And of course, more often than not, the more bugs you have in these games,

381
00:16:44,784 --> 00:16:48,734
the more they can abuse them, which gives them obviously faster times.

382
00:16:49,034 --> 00:16:50,965
And like this is a challenge actually in all

383
00:16:50,974 --> 00:16:53,775
seriousness because so let's say you're a speed runner,

384
00:16:53,784 --> 00:16:56,575
you want to start getting into the Zelda game right now,

385
00:16:56,585 --> 00:17:00,215
you need to find an original version of the cartridge which they don't make anymore.

386
00:17:00,224 --> 00:17:02,414
So you have to acquire one used.

387
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:03,184
Mhm.

388
00:17:03,284 --> 00:17:03,815
Right.

389
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:08,020
And so, I mean, this is one of the challenges. Isn't that what the pirate pays for? No.

390
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:11,310
So in all seriousness, you can hack some of the older switches,

391
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,868
but the newer switches are,

392
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,640
they learned a bunch of lessons and they're pretty un hackable at this point.

393
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,750
When you said car, my brain went to, like, not the old stuff. Yeah. Yeah.

394
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:24,930
The old stuff, you can get flash ROMs and all that kind of nonsense.

395
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:26,819
And so they have ways to work around that.

396
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:29,125
But like when you're playing, say breath of the Wild on the switch,

397
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:32,734
if you don't have a 1.0 cartridge, you can't do some of the tricks.

398
00:17:32,744 --> 00:17:34,255
And now what happens in the speed

399
00:17:34,265 --> 00:17:36,255
running world is they'll have different categories.

400
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:39,724
Well, they'll say 1.0 speed runs go over here.

401
00:17:39,734 --> 00:17:42,734
And if you're playing on a fully patched version, you're over here.

402
00:17:42,744 --> 00:17:45,035
So different divisions in weight classes. Right. Right.

403
00:17:45,045 --> 00:17:47,375
And, and people will say like no major bugs.

404
00:17:47,385 --> 00:17:49,734
Like a great example is with Super Mario world,

405
00:17:49,942 --> 00:17:53,952
you can do the arbitrary code execution, you can beat the game in like five minutes,

406
00:17:53,962 --> 00:17:54,401
I think.

407
00:17:54,411 --> 00:17:57,082
Whereas if you play it for real records like 12, I think,

408
00:17:57,092 --> 00:17:58,932
and they just have two categories where there is

409
00:17:58,942 --> 00:18:01,041
all people who want to do arbitrary code execution.

410
00:18:01,052 --> 00:18:02,112
You're competing over here.

411
00:18:02,121 --> 00:18:05,001
People who want to actually like play the game as if you're a human.

412
00:18:05,131 --> 00:18:09,161
You go over here and you compete on in this, you know, Playpen makes sense. Yeah.

413
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:12,521
Yeah. Yeah, it totally makes sense. Absolutely. So anyway, anyway, it is,

414
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,739
there's so much, there's so much to talk about.

415
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,199
I'm so excited too because I love this topic so much. So.

416
00:18:18,209 --> 00:18:20,500
So here's one of the other really cool aspects of this that,

417
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:24,219
that is kind of based upon the developer saying, oh why would anyone do that?

418
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:24,729
Is

419
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:28,560
there are also games that don't technically stop you from doing things

420
00:18:28,569 --> 00:18:30,900
and my favorite example here is a game called Super Metroid,

421
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,540
which is also for the Super Nintendo.

422
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,599
And when you speed run it,

423
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,099
there's obviously the way we would play it or the game

424
00:18:37,202 --> 00:18:41,621
kind of guides you gently through it to go over here. Do this, go over here, do this.

425
00:18:41,631 --> 00:18:44,041
And the speed runners found out that you don't actually have to

426
00:18:44,052 --> 00:18:46,102
do anything in the order they tell you to do them in.

427
00:18:46,271 --> 00:18:49,881
And so if you can, for example, get up over a cliff,

428
00:18:50,082 --> 00:18:52,501
you can go there, right? Like there's nothing stopping you.

429
00:18:52,511 --> 00:18:55,712
And so one of the craziest speed runs, if you've ever played Super Metroid,

430
00:18:55,722 --> 00:18:57,391
there's an order you beat the bosses in.

431
00:18:57,401 --> 00:18:59,171
They have something called the reverse boss order where

432
00:18:59,182 --> 00:19:00,921
they go and beat like the hardest boss first.

433
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:01,021
And

434
00:19:01,124 --> 00:19:03,343
it's amazing because like the whole while they're doing it,

435
00:19:03,354 --> 00:19:05,313
they're losing life because they're in like this lava

436
00:19:05,323 --> 00:19:08,264
filled level that is constantly draining your life.

437
00:19:08,274 --> 00:19:11,323
So they don't have any of the upgrades that keep the lava from draining your life. And

438
00:19:12,073 --> 00:19:13,104
it's so

439
00:19:13,323 --> 00:19:15,144
bizarre watching these guys do it.

440
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,744
But the thing I always think of here is, you know,

441
00:19:17,754 --> 00:19:19,254
we always talk about the fact that when you have

442
00:19:19,264 --> 00:19:21,864
a motivated attacker and you can't defend against them.

443
00:19:21,874 --> 00:19:24,933
Like these were motivated individuals like they have

444
00:19:25,046 --> 00:19:27,946
the will to figure this out. And they did,

445
00:19:28,095 --> 00:19:30,625
when you consider how much time some people spend playing video games.

446
00:19:30,635 --> 00:19:32,745
And I don't mean this, like, derogatorily, but like,

447
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,046
professional Starcraft players,

448
00:19:34,056 --> 00:19:37,706
like these guys are grinding 8 to 10 hours a day for, you know, the last decade.

449
00:19:37,715 --> 00:19:42,145
Right. Exactly. And they can, I couldn't play eight hours of a video game in one day.

450
00:19:42,156 --> 00:19:46,505
If you told me I would get a million dollars for doing it. I just, I can't, I can't do it.

451
00:19:46,515 --> 00:19:48,855
I think your hands would probably fall off at this point.

452
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:53,099
And that's actually a thing like that's the thing in Starcraft now is like a lot of

453
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,500
these players are aging out in their like thirties

454
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,459
and they're literally the one guy was like,

455
00:19:57,569 --> 00:20:01,329
yeah, my doctor says I have the hands of like a 60 year old man, right? I believe that.

456
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:01,719
So,

457
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,969
so you say this,

458
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,719
I have my right thumb is really sore right now.

459
00:20:06,729 --> 00:20:10,780
And the reason for that is Animal Crossing just came out on Friday

460
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:15,020
and I have played a lot of animal crossing and like, I have literally,

461
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,189
I have repetitive stress in my thumb.

462
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,109
I had Nintendo thumb as a kid. You know that weird.

463
00:20:19,238 --> 00:20:19,258
Yeah,

464
00:20:19,787 --> 00:20:23,728
you don't get that anymore because now you've got like the the nice stick to move.

465
00:20:23,738 --> 00:20:26,008
But yeah, for real, I've played actually

466
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:31,128
I have another funny story. So in my household, we own three switches,

467
00:20:31,478 --> 00:20:32,488
Nintendo switches.

468
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:35,637
And the reason for this was we got one on launch day and

469
00:20:35,647 --> 00:20:38,637
then it became obvious that we would need a second one to avoid,

470
00:20:38,647 --> 00:20:40,767
we'll say problems with my marriage.

471
00:20:40,937 --> 00:20:41,998
And so we,

472
00:20:42,797 --> 00:20:43,838
we acquired a second.

473
00:20:45,608 --> 00:20:46,017
That's right. That's

474
00:20:46,248 --> 00:20:46,328
right.

475
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,208
So we, we acquire a second one

476
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:52,776
and then it, at one point, my wife and Children left on a trip and

477
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:56,446
I was left without a switch and the new Mario maker came out and I just said,

478
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:57,355
I'm buying another switch.

479
00:20:57,365 --> 00:21:01,036
Right. I'm not going to not play this game. I want to play it right now.

480
00:21:01,066 --> 00:21:03,556
And I had a lot of free time because like the wife and kids were gone.

481
00:21:03,806 --> 00:21:08,355
So anyway, buy a third switch. And then on uh Animal Crossing came out on Friday.

482
00:21:08,365 --> 00:21:09,365
And on Sunday,

483
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:13,765
I went and bought 1/4 switch to avoid anyone killing anyone else in our house.

484
00:21:14,426 --> 00:21:18,296
Now I own, everyone has a switch and everyone has a copy of Animal Crossing

485
00:21:18,683 --> 00:21:22,683
in Fairness. I remember buying my first ipod and I'm like, I'll buy one ipod. My

486
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:23,404
people will share it.

487
00:21:23,413 --> 00:21:26,524
And then the next day I was at the apple store getting the second ipod. And then,

488
00:21:26,693 --> 00:21:30,543
and then when I bought their ipads, I was like, I'm not even pretending like I need,

489
00:21:30,553 --> 00:21:32,683
I need a black ipad and I need a white ipad.

490
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:33,774
So we can tell them apart.

491
00:21:34,114 --> 00:21:38,144
So like literally to this day just I, every 3 to 4 years reup.

492
00:21:38,154 --> 00:21:39,784
I've thought about getting, getting a switch.

493
00:21:39,793 --> 00:21:42,614
But yeah, I don't know, man, those things are like cocaine. Uh,

494
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:47,004
they're, they're fantastic. I'm not going to you. I love it. It is awesome.

495
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:50,812
And now I have the little one which I'm loving because I thought the switch is too big.

496
00:21:50,822 --> 00:21:53,651
That's my story. But Animal Crossing is great, by the way.

497
00:21:53,802 --> 00:21:55,261
Yeah. No, it's, and, and, well,

498
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:57,072
see, that's what gets me about Nintendo, right?

499
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:59,472
Is they got two things build quality because like

500
00:21:59,482 --> 00:22:02,661
I took my Nintendo wii not the Wii universal,

501
00:22:02,671 --> 00:22:05,472
but like the original Wii and it had been sitting in like a,

502
00:22:05,482 --> 00:22:08,781
a plastic box in my garage for like five or six years and I plugged

503
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:11,432
it in and then realized I couldn't plug it in because it didn't have HDMIO.

504
00:22:11,442 --> 00:22:15,592
So I had to go on Amazon by like a 20 I think it was like a $23 adapter

505
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:19,400
and then that showed up like four days later, plug it in and it just works. Yeah. Yeah.

506
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:19,640
There,

507
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:23,040
I still have my original Nintendo in the basement

508
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,949
and every now and then I will plug it in

509
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,589
and it is basically flawless to this day.

510
00:22:27,689 --> 00:22:29,380
And the second thing is Nintendo.

511
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,239
I don't know what pact they made with the devil,

512
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,959
but they make some of the most fun games to play

513
00:22:35,209 --> 00:22:39,390
it. I won't disagree with you. I have been like Mario, Zelda,

514
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:43,800
Mario and Zelda alone. Mario and Zelda are my favorite games ever.

515
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:46,930
Well, alone, those games Nintendo would make enough money to it.

516
00:22:46,939 --> 00:22:47,819
Would be embarrassing,

517
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,390
right?

518
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,099
Like they literally, if they literally only made those two franchises,

519
00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:54,689
they could stay in business for 100 years.

520
00:22:54,699 --> 00:22:55,589
Probably.

521
00:22:55,729 --> 00:22:58,739
They, there's actually a really cool quote from.

522
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:58,989
So,

523
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,010
so the guy who created Donkey Kong and Mario and Zelda and

524
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,829
there's Peakman and there's a bunch of basically most of Nintendo's characters,

525
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:08,359
except for me,

526
00:23:08,545 --> 00:23:10,324
except Metroid were created by this guy named

527
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,444
Shigeru Miyamoto.

528
00:23:11,545 --> 00:23:12,984
And he is,

529
00:23:13,145 --> 00:23:13,334
I

530
00:23:13,494 --> 00:23:14,415
read an

531
00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:16,545
interview with him once that he used to joke,

532
00:23:16,555 --> 00:23:18,864
you was the best video game designer in the world because he was

533
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:21,645
the only video game designer in the world when he created Donkey Kong.

534
00:23:21,655 --> 00:23:24,285
And like now I don't think anyone would argue with that.

535
00:23:24,295 --> 00:23:28,324
Like he, he, he's the Einstein of video games. Yeah, for real straight up.

536
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,719
But anyway, he has this quote where he basically says

537
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:35,430
that he will never release a game before it's done because

538
00:23:35,439 --> 00:23:38,420
a game delayed by two weeks is delayed by two weeks,

539
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:41,390
but a game released bad is bad forever.

540
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,079
And there's been so many of those like,

541
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:45,339
remember like what was it Red Dead redemption?

542
00:23:45,349 --> 00:23:48,959
Like watching some of those glitchy attempts to play it, like, what was it?

543
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:52,459
Red Dead Redemption or another one that was just so glitchy. I don't know.

544
00:23:52,469 --> 00:23:54,560
I mean, I don't, I haven't played Red Dead Redemption.

545
00:23:54,673 --> 00:23:56,494
I don't feel like I saw a lot of

546
00:23:56,673 --> 00:23:58,734
like great broken glitches

547
00:23:59,553 --> 00:23:59,614
that

548
00:24:00,473 --> 00:24:04,593
but there are games that had been released that were unplayable, bad.

549
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:09,284
Absolutely. Who could imagine releasing broken software to people,

550
00:24:09,423 --> 00:24:09,973
you know, as,

551
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:12,514
as we have like Oracle patch or Oracle

552
00:24:12,524 --> 00:24:15,573
quarterly patch and patch Tuesday for Microsoft.

553
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:17,994
And I mean, I get at some point it's normal,

554
00:24:18,004 --> 00:24:19,833
you can't fix all the bugs before you release it.

555
00:24:19,843 --> 00:24:20,343
But yeah,

556
00:24:20,527 --> 00:24:22,037
leaving it in a playable state.

557
00:24:22,047 --> 00:24:24,358
And I, I think in general software, you know,

558
00:24:24,368 --> 00:24:28,458
being in a not completely unusable security state would be good.

559
00:24:28,498 --> 00:24:31,708
Well, and you have to think, I mean, video games back in the day,

560
00:24:31,718 --> 00:24:34,307
it's a little different now with all the online everything,

561
00:24:34,317 --> 00:24:37,958
but back in the day you had a cartridge or a CD.

562
00:24:38,037 --> 00:24:40,787
And that was the end, if it, if it was broken

563
00:24:41,037 --> 00:24:41,958
that, that was it,

564
00:24:42,128 --> 00:24:42,947
there was, there was no,

565
00:24:43,307 --> 00:24:44,838
all those, what is it, those, um,

566
00:24:44,848 --> 00:24:47,911
Atari et cartridges is that they dumped out in the middle of

567
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:50,631
the desert and somebody actually tracked down and dug them back up,

568
00:24:50,641 --> 00:24:51,362
right?

569
00:24:52,271 --> 00:24:52,291
So

570
00:24:52,482 --> 00:24:57,732
horrifically bad. But that was not because I mean, so ET sucked for its own reasons.

571
00:24:57,741 --> 00:25:02,671
However, I will say that game was made in like a month by one person.

572
00:25:02,822 --> 00:25:05,881
So in that context it's surprisingly good,

573
00:25:06,102 --> 00:25:06,641
but

574
00:25:06,791 --> 00:25:09,631
it was, it was terrible and I don't know if this is true.

575
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:12,102
I, I'll, I'll try to look it up and put a link to it. But I,

576
00:25:12,235 --> 00:25:17,436
I remember I heard once they released more ET cartridges than they had sold Atari,

577
00:25:17,446 --> 00:25:20,406
which obviously you can imagine, just economically speaking,

578
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:21,676
that is a bad decision.

579
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:25,615
Yeah, it's in the, it's a popular rumor according to Wikipedia.

580
00:25:26,015 --> 00:25:26,095
Yeah.

581
00:25:26,245 --> 00:25:27,576
You think they would?

582
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,505
And no one's going to admit anything because everything

583
00:25:30,515 --> 00:25:32,375
that happened around that game was a train wreck.

584
00:25:32,385 --> 00:25:37,926
Well, they buried 728,000 cartridges of various games.

585
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,410
The whole,

586
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,839
the whole game industry crashed at that

587
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:45,729
point because Atari was releasing shovelware.

588
00:25:45,739 --> 00:25:47,589
Although one of the issues actually,

589
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:50,290
so I just watched a documentary about this not long ago

590
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,640
is Atari, like anyone could release Atari games because they had the

591
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,140
attitude of we'll just sell units,

592
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:58,609
people can make software and so people were releasing garbage

593
00:25:58,729 --> 00:25:59,300
and then,

594
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,400
and this is one of the things Nintendo actually did

595
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:03,280
when they released the Nes is they said no,

596
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:03,709
no,

597
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:06,300
if you're going to release games, like you have to come to us.

598
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,859
And this is actually where the Nes lockout chip comes from.

599
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,189
Nintendo was famous for being completely fascist about who

600
00:26:12,199 --> 00:26:14,130
they would let develop games for their platform.

601
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,930
Yeah, but on the flip side, yeah, there weren't a lot of terrible ones.

602
00:26:17,939 --> 00:26:21,329
Oh, there were tons of terrible Nes games. Well, I don't remember them.

603
00:26:21,859 --> 00:26:26,010
Yeah. True. Survivor Bias, man. No, I'm thinking of actually I downloaded a RO

604
00:26:26,189 --> 00:26:29,439
pack and I was looking for some of them and like, yeah, I tried playing

605
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,739
two random ones and it was

606
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:31,770
terrible

607
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:32,619
and there were,

608
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:36,780
there were like 200 Change Nes games if I recall correctly or was it 400?

609
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:39,089
It's, it's 2 to 400 somewhere in there. Right.

610
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:39,859
And

611
00:26:39,989 --> 00:26:42,900
if you told me to basically like list Nintendo games,

612
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:45,140
I think I would struggle to list more than 20

613
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,260
because I can list like the 20 that aren't terrible.

614
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,859
715. 0, wow. That many.

615
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:50,900
Now,

616
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:53,489
at the same time there's a guy, I will find a link to this.

617
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,550
There's, there's a runner who goes by TMR. He's the Mexican runner

618
00:26:57,839 --> 00:26:58,369
and

619
00:26:58,949 --> 00:26:59,780
like, that's his name.

620
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:03,099
T MRI just got, I'm like, wow, that's, that's borderline racist.

621
00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:06,849
OK. The Mexican runner that can't be right. I'm like, oh no, that, that's him.

622
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:10,550
He, he lives in Mexico in his defense. So he is literally a Mexican runner.

623
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:11,150
But

624
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:12,069
OK,

625
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,349
so anyway, he beat

626
00:27:17,045 --> 00:27:21,614
Nes game like he made that his goal. What does this guy do for a day job?

627
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:24,354
That's his day job. He like, he does like Twitch Streaming and

628
00:27:24,864 --> 00:27:26,395
he streams on Facebook now.

629
00:27:26,405 --> 00:27:28,555
He's a, I haven't watched the stream because I like,

630
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,255
I'm not willing to do that on Facebook.

631
00:27:30,265 --> 00:27:30,584
But

632
00:27:30,704 --> 00:27:32,194
yeah, yeah, like he's the real deal.

633
00:27:32,204 --> 00:27:34,744
He's really funny actually when he does speed runs at

634
00:27:34,755 --> 00:27:36,795
like games done quick or any of these events,

635
00:27:36,844 --> 00:27:37,584
he is,

636
00:27:37,714 --> 00:27:40,744
he's a hoot because he's really funny and his

637
00:27:40,755 --> 00:27:43,275
humor is really dry and he's really good.

638
00:27:43,569 --> 00:27:45,869
So it's, it's one of the, you need that, like,

639
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,829
combination where you can be really good and really boring

640
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:51,219
or you can be really funny and kind of bad

641
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:53,150
when you're both. It's amazing.

642
00:27:53,329 --> 00:27:53,650
Yeah.

643
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,310
No, it's,

644
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:56,609
it's funny to watch those professional video game

645
00:27:56,619 --> 00:27:59,010
commentators because some of them are not good.

646
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:02,369
But I get that there's such a small pool of them that it doesn't really matter.

647
00:28:02,469 --> 00:28:05,810
But the thing is though, some of them are just beyond hilarious. And

648
00:28:05,979 --> 00:28:07,930
it's funny because there's actually a couple that remind me

649
00:28:07,939 --> 00:28:09,989
of myself in that they are terrible on their own.

650
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:13,150
Just terrible on everyone with the right partner.

651
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:14,569
Beautiful.

652
00:28:14,719 --> 00:28:16,810
Well, no, some of these commentators are good on their own.

653
00:28:16,819 --> 00:28:20,819
Like um no, no, I, I get this. I, there are very few I will say this.

654
00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:22,400
So actually I will, I will tell the story.

655
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,430
I don't know if I've ever told you this story before or not,

656
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:27,339
but I tell it to everyone I talk to about us.

657
00:28:27,349 --> 00:28:28,569
The podcast is

658
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,969
when I met you for the first time,

659
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:31,890
right?

660
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,640
And I remember because Vincent was someone we worked with at

661
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:38,439
Redhead and he basically will say prepared me for meeting you,

662
00:28:38,449 --> 00:28:38,599
right?

663
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:39,550
And,

664
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,579
but anyway, I'm like, ok, we'll see like, and,

665
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:48,140
and you are one of those person that you fill a room, I'll say that, right?

666
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:51,069
That's the polite way of saying you're just kind of loud and in everyone's face.

667
00:28:51,189 --> 00:28:52,739
But like, you fill the room, right.

668
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:56,339
And I remember I met you and I thought I want to do a podcast with this guy someday.

669
00:28:56,349 --> 00:28:57,619
Like that is my goal.

670
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:00,949
And of course, we, we made it there and, and I'm very pleased by that.

671
00:29:00,959 --> 00:29:03,719
That's because the usual reaction is people want to punch me in the throat.

672
00:29:03,729 --> 00:29:06,739
I, I, that mine was, I want to do a podcast with you. So it worked.

673
00:29:07,046 --> 00:29:10,895
But like the point is like, I know if I did a podcast, it would be by myself.

674
00:29:10,906 --> 00:29:11,765
It would be boring.

675
00:29:11,936 --> 00:29:14,965
If I did, if you did a podcast, it would probably also be boring.

676
00:29:14,975 --> 00:29:16,485
But I feel like when you put us together,

677
00:29:16,495 --> 00:29:19,926
we have the right Yang and Yang on most of this that I think it works

678
00:29:20,056 --> 00:29:22,086
and it's, it's awesome anyway. Anyway.

679
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:26,046
But at the same time, like there's lots of podcasts, like I listen to a lot of podcasts

680
00:29:26,225 --> 00:29:26,725
and

681
00:29:26,855 --> 00:29:30,765
there are very few that are one person I can tolerate

682
00:29:31,251 --> 00:29:34,112
because generally speaking, I think when you're by yourself,

683
00:29:34,212 --> 00:29:35,791
it gets boring eventually.

684
00:29:35,802 --> 00:29:39,352
Whereas when there's other other people, you can work together. It's hard.

685
00:29:39,362 --> 00:29:41,261
Well, how do you present two different viewpoints?

686
00:29:41,602 --> 00:29:45,612
Right. Like you do a funny voice for one. No, seriously, right? Like they don't,

687
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:46,411
they don't,

688
00:29:46,442 --> 00:29:50,072
the one thing I've consistently not the good one person podcasts are either

689
00:29:50,391 --> 00:29:53,251
somebody who is going over like amazing content.

690
00:29:53,261 --> 00:29:55,462
Like say David Allen's GTD podcasts

691
00:29:55,677 --> 00:29:57,218
come out like four times a year

692
00:29:57,858 --> 00:30:01,578
or they interview people a lot, which is, well, basically a two person podcast.

693
00:30:01,588 --> 00:30:02,978
Yeah, that's not a one person podcast.

694
00:30:02,988 --> 00:30:06,177
Then I don't, I consider I'm ok with, with interview podcast because like,

695
00:30:06,187 --> 00:30:07,988
whiskey Business is a great example where like

696
00:30:07,998 --> 00:30:09,697
that guy is always talking to somebody,

697
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:10,078
right?

698
00:30:10,328 --> 00:30:10,978
Whereas,

699
00:30:11,338 --> 00:30:14,687
yeah, if it's just a person talking into a microphone,

700
00:30:14,907 --> 00:30:18,598
it always bores me and I never, I never stick with them.

701
00:30:18,647 --> 00:30:21,494
Well, I think this is one of the reasons public speaking is so scary to most people.

702
00:30:21,504 --> 00:30:21,683
Right.

703
00:30:21,693 --> 00:30:23,994
Like getting up in front of everybody having 100% of

704
00:30:24,004 --> 00:30:26,443
their attention for 5 to 30 minutes and speaking,

705
00:30:26,453 --> 00:30:27,764
let's, let's be blunt.

706
00:30:27,774 --> 00:30:27,984
Right?

707
00:30:27,994 --> 00:30:30,264
Like one thing I've noticed with this thing going around

708
00:30:30,274 --> 00:30:32,404
the world is watching some of these politicians speak.

709
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:34,563
Wow, brutal, terrible.

710
00:30:34,573 --> 00:30:37,244
You know, and then some of these politicians, it's like, ok, wow, I,

711
00:30:37,254 --> 00:30:39,244
I feel slightly less terrible now.

712
00:30:39,384 --> 00:30:42,963
It's, yeah, it's not for everybody and it's, it's hard, it's really hard.

713
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:44,404
It's hard to hold an audience.

714
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:49,219
I, I have so many stories. II, I like, I love giving talks to conferences. I really do.

715
00:30:49,229 --> 00:30:50,540
I really enjoy it. And

716
00:30:50,739 --> 00:30:52,060
I have been to

717
00:30:52,209 --> 00:30:54,859
probably more bad security talks than good.

718
00:30:54,869 --> 00:30:56,739
I would say if I was going to count them all.

719
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,569
And I'm,

720
00:30:57,579 --> 00:31:00,599
I'm actually really sad what we'll have to do an episode at some point

721
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:04,140
here because I have this marvelous star Trek talk I've been working on for,

722
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,209
for years at this point,

723
00:31:05,219 --> 00:31:09,280
but it's all about the security problems on the starship enterprise.

724
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:12,150
And I call it next generation enterprise security because

725
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,489
I focus on Star Trek the next year.

726
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:14,410
Like it's,

727
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:16,469
it's a marvelous talk and I don't know if I'm going

728
00:31:16,479 --> 00:31:18,229
to be giving it for a very long time now.

729
00:31:18,239 --> 00:31:20,489
But anyway, anyway, I'm not talking about this right now.

730
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,310
That's depressing and annoying. And it is time for us to wrap up anyway. So

731
00:31:24,459 --> 00:31:28,150
here's what I will tell anyone interested in this is

732
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,339
there are amazing resources if you want to get

733
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:34,540
into speed running or just watch speed running.

734
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:37,270
Because like, for, I, I, I've tried doing some of this.

735
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:38,349
I can't

736
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:38,989
rocket

737
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:40,250
jump

738
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,459
anymore. Well, sort of.

739
00:31:41,469 --> 00:31:42,380
So, I mean, here's,

740
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:44,619
the challenge is so at one point I was able to

741
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:47,329
beat the original Super Mario Brothers in about six minutes.

742
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:47,719
Right.

743
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,880
But I was playing an hour a day probably to get there.

744
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:53,729
And I realized finally, like, I'm sick of playing this game.

745
00:31:53,739 --> 00:31:58,349
I don't want to play it anymore. And I actually yesterday I picked up my switch.

746
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:00,010
I started Super Mario Brothers

747
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:05,199
and I, I suck. Right. Because like, I've lost the skills. I need to beat it that fast.

748
00:32:05,209 --> 00:32:07,069
And it's like, well, that's that

749
00:32:08,329 --> 00:32:11,130
I'm not going to invest the time again to do this.

750
00:32:11,459 --> 00:32:15,839
But, but if you watch people do it, it's, it's amazing and you know what, you know,

751
00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:16,800
what really

752
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,959
is the thing I always tell people is,

753
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:24,890
I don't understand how, like my father can watch football on a Sunday all day.

754
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,369
Like, it just doesn't hold my attention.

755
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,369
I can watch maybe an hour of it and I'm like, I'm sick of this.

756
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,890
I don't care if you're into a sport

757
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,280
and you watch the professionals do it.

758
00:32:33,449 --> 00:32:35,290
I can now appreciate that because, like,

759
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,329
I watch these people play Super Mario brothers and I appreciate

760
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:40,050
what they're doing and I know how hard it is.

761
00:32:40,439 --> 00:32:46,260
And so it has given me a appreciation for sport ball that I never had in the past.

762
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,180
Well, it's, it's classic Dunning Kruger.

763
00:32:48,189 --> 00:32:51,310
You need to actually have a reasonable amount of knowledge to

764
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:53,670
have an appreciation for who is good and bad at this.

765
00:32:53,709 --> 00:32:55,060
Yeah, that's exactly right.

766
00:32:55,069 --> 00:32:58,880
Or like, are they even playing, like, if you showed me 10 football games and said, ok,

767
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:01,199
which one of these teams is playing good football and bad football?

768
00:33:01,209 --> 00:33:01,770
I'd be like,

769
00:33:02,589 --> 00:33:07,180
yeah. Right. Exactly. I, yeah, I have no idea. One of them won. Ok. That was neat.

770
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:08,839
I have no idea what happened.

771
00:33:09,209 --> 00:33:10,189
Yeah, exactly.

772
00:33:10,479 --> 00:33:11,500
Anyway, anyway,

773
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:14,859
all right, sweet. I'm going to call this and for real.

774
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:17,900
Like, if, if this is something you'd be mildly interesting, go check it out.
