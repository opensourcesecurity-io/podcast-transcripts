Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast.

1
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:11,810
Episode 131 with myself, Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:11,819 --> 00:00:12,529
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,149
What's new man?

4
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:15,439
I ran out of decaf

5
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:16,530
coffee. Decaf.

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,079
Why is that a problem? Like it's decaf, you could drink water.

7
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:24,440
Apparently when I drink real coffee, I talk too fast on the podcast.

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,879
You do talk fast but running out of decaf

9
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:30,159
just like stir some mud in your water or something and it's

10
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,649
pretty much the same thing. Right.

11
00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:35,020
-- Well,
-- here's the weirdest part as far as I can tell my Costco doesn't sell decaf

12
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:35,729
coffee.

13
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:39,849
I don't know if I've ever looked Costco's coffee selection,

14
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,130
-- I think is quite bad and I generally don't purchase
-- coffee.

15
00:00:43,139 --> 00:00:43,169
There,

16
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:43,340
there's,

17
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,209
you have about 10 choices.

18
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,970
Half of them are pods and half of them are beans and most of the beans are Starbucks.

19
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:49,209
So.

20
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,459
Right. And I don't look at the pods.

21
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:52,479
I,

22
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:57,439
I actually had one of those pod making coffee things once and the waste was horrific.

23
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,330
And then I started using it to make, uh, noodles

24
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,340
because I could get hot water very quickly.

25
00:01:02,349 --> 00:01:04,919
And then I realized why am I using a very

26
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,599
expensive coffee maker to make hot water when I can

27
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:12,830
use my $25 tea kettle over there. And it actually gets hotter and better. So

28
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:14,220
I got rid of it.

29
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,309
I grew up with one of those German instant hot water taps that has like,

30
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:19,669
basically a little boiler.

31
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:19,699
Oh,

32
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,419
those are the best man. Yeah.

33
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:25,389
And so I just, I, I took that for granted and now it's, it's II,

34
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,029
I really do wish I had one.

35
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,699
I got one of the electric kettles when from, you know, various trips to Europe,

36
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:33,279
they always had the nice electric kettles.

37
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,989
-- Now, granted, Europe has 200.
-- Those things are a fire hazard.

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,430
200 and 40 volts, they're not a fire hazard.

39
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,290
They've got 240 volts.

40
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:44,489
So the ones they have work like scary fast and

41
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,660
the one I have is obviously plugs into us.

42
00:01:47,669 --> 00:01:49,250
Voltage 120 volts.

43
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,940
It's still acceptable. I can get a pot of hot water, a liter of hot water in

44
00:01:54,669 --> 00:01:57,580
probably two minutes, which I think is acceptable.

45
00:01:58,019 --> 00:01:59,660
And I really like it because

46
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:05,610
I can put as much as I want, obviously turn it on and it is way faster than my stove was

47
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,500
and it is made of glass and clear. So it amuses me that I can watch the bubbles. So,

48
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:15,300
there you go. That is always fun. It is. It's fantastic, man. I, I love it and,

49
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:19,440
and it also amuses me that it only has leader markings on the side of it.

50
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:22,830
-- So it's clearly this was not built for the US audience.
-- Oh, right.

51
00:02:22,839 --> 00:02:24,000
Because, yeah, sorry. Yeah.

52
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:26,399
See, that wouldn't have occurred to me as a problem, but as a Canadian,

53
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,270
I speak fluent metric and

54
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:29,369
material. Right.

55
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,350
You use the good way to measure things and not a ridiculous,

56
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:36,535
you know, all of our building supplies are, are imperial.

57
00:02:36,544 --> 00:02:38,345
Uh, That doesn't surprise me.

58
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:39,134
Everything.

59
00:02:39,145 --> 00:02:40,395
Half inch copper tubing,

60
00:02:40,404 --> 00:02:41,945
four by eight sheet supply wood that are

61
00:02:41,955 --> 00:02:45,365
actually 49 inches by 83 inches because yeah,

62
00:02:45,764 --> 00:02:47,014
well, that's the beauty of it too.

63
00:02:47,024 --> 00:02:47,335
Like,

64
00:02:47,345 --> 00:02:49,804
like none of those sizes of building materials are

65
00:02:49,815 --> 00:02:52,625
actually the sizes that they say they are,

66
00:02:52,815 --> 00:02:55,804
which is hilarious in its own sad way.

67
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:59,399
And it actually is a nightmare because my house was built in 1919.

68
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,039
And so the two by fours in my house are actually two by four.

69
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,119
So anytime anyone has to do any sort of work on anything

70
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,429
you have to accommodate for that, which is

71
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,919
-- funny and sad at the same, you have to
-- go by a four by six and clean it down.

72
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:12,470
I

73
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,750
put in a regular two by four and scab it out with f

74
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:19,580
it's way easier, man.

75
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,710
It depends what it is too, right?

76
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,399
Like when, when I put in a door and I had to like muck with a load bearing wall.

77
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,389
Yeah, that one got two by six is all cut up.

78
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:32,979
So that's actually a perfect lead in for this, which is um

79
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:38,449
zero. Patch.com has just released three micro patches for three Windows.

80
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,110
Zero days.

81
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,690
Yeah, you need to explain this to,

82
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:44,630
we'll say to me what you actually just did a little while ago

83
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:47,589
because I'm certain there are some listeners that don't understand and like,

84
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,940
I don't run Windows anymore, so I don't even know what's going on.

85
00:03:51,279 --> 00:03:54,149
So basically when you have

86
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:54,259
a

87
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,740
bug, be it security flaw or otherwise in a piece of software,

88
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,320
the typical thing you would do is well with open source, you'd

89
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:06,509
update that software or add a patch to fix the behavior recompile and deploy it, just

90
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,270
-- ignore it forever,
-- which is

91
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:10,580
um or you know,

92
00:04:10,589 --> 00:04:13,309
in the case of something like a proprietary piece

93
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,729
of software where you only have the binary,

94
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,738
typically, you, you wait for the vendor to

95
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,459
issue a fix and for them to do it on their end, right?

96
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,488
They patch the source code, recompile

97
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,579
Q A it test it blah, blah blah and ship it out,

98
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:27,700
which is what Microsoft does every patch Tuesday.

99
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:29,019
-- Right. Yes,
-- exactly.

100
00:04:29,179 --> 00:04:33,109
But the thing is you can for certain types of bugs actually

101
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,820
modify the binary typically in

102
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:35,970
a

103
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,679
relatively small way like several

104
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:46,179
statements or several um essentially several assembler commands can be replaced

105
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,140
to

106
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:48,220
patch that bug.

107
00:04:48,859 --> 00:04:53,440
And this is binary patching and some vendors actually do, do this.

108
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:57,230
So um Google's Courgette, I wrote an article about this probably a decade ago.

109
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,920
Courgette. The idea was,

110
00:04:59,109 --> 00:05:02,279
well, we need to replace this binary, like chrome

111
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,130
your web browser.

112
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,820
We need to update this binary, but we,

113
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:07,399
we actually only need to make a change to like 1% of it

114
00:05:07,619 --> 00:05:09,500
for this, you know, update, right? We're not, right.

115
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,970
We haven't completely changed and rewritten the program from scratch. We've just

116
00:05:13,109 --> 00:05:15,390
added support for this and fix that. And

117
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,929
the actual difference in the Binaries if you build them correctly is like maybe 1%.

118
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,399
So that meant they could chip a patch for your system.

119
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,820
That was a megabyte instead of 100 megabytes, which

120
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,670
you know, when you have many, many millions of end users using this,

121
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:33,769
that really adds up and, and it creates a much better user experience because, well,

122
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:36,980
not to throw Microsoft under the bus, but every Microsoft patch, Tuesday,

123
00:05:36,989 --> 00:05:37,799
I don't even run windows.

124
00:05:37,809 --> 00:05:39,579
I just have a Microsoft office installed

125
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,380
on average. I would say it's about two gigabytes of download

126
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:45,079
which thank goodness, I live in the city and have high speed internet.

127
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:47,170
But I'm thinking if you live out in the country, you know,

128
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:49,140
with five or 10 megabit internet,

129
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:51,570
which is pretty good by country standards in North America

130
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,619
-- that would take all day.
-- Well, Linux

131
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:58,220
patches are similar where you generally have to download a whole new package

132
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:01,774
and you just rip and replace and I'm sure Windows does similar things.

133
00:06:01,785 --> 00:06:02,394
And I know

134
00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:05,195
as part of Microsoft's SDLC program,

135
00:06:05,454 --> 00:06:07,515
they added, they basically made the statement that,

136
00:06:07,524 --> 00:06:09,834
like if you're modifying code in a function,

137
00:06:09,845 --> 00:06:11,954
we're going to rewrite the whole function because

138
00:06:11,964 --> 00:06:13,954
it's quite likely there's other problems in it.

139
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:18,355
And so they're replacing probably quite a bit of code on a regular basis and I,

140
00:06:18,554 --> 00:06:22,355
I doubt they're monkey patching. They're probably rip, rip and replacing files.

141
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:23,160
Yeah.

142
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,799
So, anyways, uh I guess the premise of zero patch is that kind of like, well,

143
00:06:27,809 --> 00:06:31,600
very similar to uh what were those network protection,

144
00:06:31,609 --> 00:06:33,589
uh IP S intrusion protection systems.

145
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:33,619
I'm

146
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,070
trying to think of the vendors that used to sponsor P

147
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:36,839
to own.

148
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:39,290
And so they would get these zero days and then they would write these,

149
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:40,450
these uh what was it called?

150
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:42,119
Like network DNA scripts or something that

151
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,190
the attacks

152
00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:45,399
uh tipping point. That's the one,

153
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:46,269
right?

154
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,640
So the premise was basically, it's like,

155
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:49,809
rather than having to patch 10,000 windows machines,

156
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:52,000
you have this thing sitting on your network that like

157
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:53,000
blocks

158
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,470
attack X.

159
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,600
That's it. It just magically blocks attack X that

160
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,859
we solve the problem.

161
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,079
And so zero patch

162
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:02,959
takes that to the,

163
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,399
well, the machine level where OK, we've,

164
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,549
there's CV E food, there's no patch from Microsoft for it yet.

165
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:14,480
So here's a small binary patch and in this case, they've released um three A SM files,

166
00:07:14,489 --> 00:07:15,630
you know, a similar files.

167
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,869
So, what is this? Like three maybe four dozen lines of text.

168
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,239
So the patch itself, you can, you can look at and see

169
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,399
what it's

170
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,510
attempting to do.

171
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:28,049
Part of the concern though is this is not, you know,

172
00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:29,760
applying a source code patch to source code.

173
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:30,589
This is applying

174
00:07:30,869 --> 00:07:34,899
a small binary patch to a really huge and complicated binary, right?

175
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,529
I mean, most Windows binaries,

176
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,239
um I've met people who disassemble them and,

177
00:07:39,299 --> 00:07:42,799
and try to understand them for a living and it's a, it's a nontrivial task,

178
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,010
but it is doable to be clear.

179
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:50,239
This is absolutely doable and it can be done in a reasonably sane and trustworthy way

180
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:54,720
assuming this zero patch company is doing a good job. But I don't know.

181
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,459
So anyways, they've released these three micro patches,

182
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,089
you can apply them to your window system and in theory,

183
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,619
they will address these 30 days

184
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,059
and you're good to go.

185
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,059
Uh, they probably do. I mean, so here's going to be my complaint.

186
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,829
Well, I shouldn't say complaint. Here is the explanation I would give around.

187
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:12,700
This is

188
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,320
a long time ago. People would say things like

189
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:18,100
open source is less secure because anyone can

190
00:08:18,109 --> 00:08:19,880
see the source code and they know what's happening

191
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:20,920
and

192
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:26,149
it is quite clear that just because something is in a binary only format,

193
00:08:26,929 --> 00:08:29,940
it does not make anything more secretive or safe.

194
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:33,250
Well, you don't even need to look at it. You just fuzz it nowadays, right?

195
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,929
American fuzzy loop or something and you can find tons of bugs,

196
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:37,169
you, you fuzz it.

197
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:39,929
But then there's people who will look and say, well, here's what's wrong, right.

198
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,520
There's missing a length check is missing on this

199
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:45,710
line here or this line here is doing something.

200
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:47,390
It shouldn't, it's obviously missing

201
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,580
one of the, the parameters for copying memory is wrong. The math is wrong, whatever.

202
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,830
Right. There's, there's a million things it can be

203
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:54,760
and

204
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,239
the, the tools and the people are so sophisticated now

205
00:08:58,479 --> 00:08:59,039
that

206
00:08:59,489 --> 00:08:59,799
it

207
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:04,940
honestly binary code is as good as source code in, in many, many instances.

208
00:09:04,969 --> 00:09:06,640
I was just about to say the thing.

209
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,840
It's weird to me that people ignore the fact that binary code

210
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:13,479
is, it's just machine readable source code

211
00:09:14,369 --> 00:09:14,739
that's been

212
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,419
and sometimes it's, it's mangled a bit like um CS S MIN,

213
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,659
you know, or uh sorry javascript min,

214
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:25,390
you know, which packs takes out all the white space and, and smashes the,

215
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,900
the variable names and makes it a, you know, kind of painful to understand.

216
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:29,219
But

217
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:30,510
fundamentally

218
00:09:30,849 --> 00:09:31,330
the

219
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:33,820
the intent and the code is still there.

220
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:38,469
You know, you can, there, I know people that can comfortably read assembler,

221
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:42,270
you know, you give them a file full of assembler and they like the matrix.

222
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,119
You know, I see a,

223
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,650
I see a dog and I see a cat and I see a whatever and it's just like, wow, your,

224
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:49,270
your brain is something different than mine.

225
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:49,979
That's for sure.

226
00:09:50,369 --> 00:09:52,469
You know, and we need people like that. But

227
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,969
man, they scare me sometimes.

228
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,190
It's fundamentally it's machine readable code.

229
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:59,729
And if it's machine readable code, that means a human being can also understand.

230
00:09:59,739 --> 00:10:03,159
It might take a little longer, it might take a little, you know, a few extra tools.

231
00:10:03,349 --> 00:10:05,900
But we've had those tools for 20 or 30 years now.

232
00:10:06,219 --> 00:10:08,419
Uh Yeah, the tools are pretty good. And

233
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,479
if you're used to assembler,

234
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:14,500
it's not that hard to figure out what's going on in a lot of cases.

235
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:17,780
My fear or my amazement is that they can hold

236
00:10:18,109 --> 00:10:18,590
the, the

237
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:23,200
concept of what the program is doing in their head, you know, holding a concept with,

238
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:26,719
of, you know, thousands of branch statements and hundreds.

239
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,359
Have you ever seen those people that do

240
00:10:28,369 --> 00:10:30,789
the disassembler and create those flow chart diagrams

241
00:10:30,989 --> 00:10:33,469
of like of an application, right? And you end up with

242
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,919
-- make
-- those, the disassembler makes them well.

243
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:36,530
Yeah, exactly.

244
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:40,799
And you end up with this thing that has like 4000 boxes and 3000 lines and

245
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,440
is just like a something a cat would cough up.

246
00:10:43,989 --> 00:10:47,419
But that's what your program looked like before you assembled it.

247
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:51,419
It's just the assembler does a nicer job of turning it into the spaghetti.

248
00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:52,590
It is because

249
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,320
in a lot of instances, if you take your program

250
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:59,679
and you try to kind of do that, the code execution tracing like you end up with there.

251
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,559
Uh it'll skip over things like system calls which let's face

252
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,700
it. They're actually really important.

253
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:08,479
-- But once you're dealing with kind of, some of the assembly and
-- some of them are deep,

254
00:11:08,849 --> 00:11:10,030
like some of them are

255
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:12,619
something that, like a single statement that, you know,

256
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,929
that's thousands and thousands of instructions.

257
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,690
Ultimately.

258
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,280
Oh, more than that, I bet, I bet most Libs

259
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,219
calls actually, I should look into this. This would be a fun project.

260
00:11:22,229 --> 00:11:25,340
So I just ran into a, I have a small Python script.

261
00:11:25,349 --> 00:11:28,429
I used to validate email addresses and I use the Python email validator.

262
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,890
And one of the things it can do, which is quite handy is

263
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,150
it takes the domain name and actually validates that there's an

264
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:36,890
MX record or valid IP for it and next to it,

265
00:11:37,469 --> 00:11:38,380
right. So

266
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:42,010
you plug in google.com and it's like, yeah, google.com has an MX record.

267
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,929
I talked to port 25 on it. It worked great

268
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,570
and

269
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,450
I haven't run the script in a long time.

270
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,489
And apparently at some point in the last few weeks,

271
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,309
my ISP blocked my outgoing access to port 25.

272
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,219
So I run the script

273
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:55,729
and I get this just weird trace back error in Python saying, you know, I just,

274
00:11:55,739 --> 00:11:57,789
it can't, it doesn't work, it doesn't, it's not working.

275
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,049
My first thought was, oh, I've enabled I PV six across my network, maybe I PV six

276
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:04,500
broke, you know, is my Python compiled with IP P six support. I don't know,

277
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:09,690
you know, it's whatever came on my Mac machine from X code or whatever.

278
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,229
So I, I check into that.

279
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:12,559
No, it doesn't seem to be that and,

280
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,010
and I finally like five minutes later try tail netting to

281
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,049
port 25 because let's just see if it's actually responding.

282
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:18,729
Right. Nope,

283
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,830
it's now blocked by the ISP. So, you know, that single line of Python that

284
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,099
results in Lord knows how many system calls and

285
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:26,969
calls

286
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:27,950
to go out.

287
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:32,239
You know, do an MX look up, connect to a port that's got to be, I

288
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,299
don't know, not a million instructions but more than 1000.

289
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:35,869
Oh, I

290
00:12:35,984 --> 00:12:40,465
-- wouldn't be shocked at all if it's a million, it might even be more true.
-- So,

291
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,715
see, I'm, I'm not really sure what to make of this micro patch.

292
00:12:42,724 --> 00:12:45,044
And because my one thought is somebody who's paranoid

293
00:12:45,054 --> 00:12:47,684
enough that they need to fix their zero days and

294
00:12:47,895 --> 00:12:50,715
be invulnerable to them and can't wait for Microsoft

295
00:12:51,005 --> 00:12:52,645
at the same time, I imagine

296
00:12:53,044 --> 00:12:57,614
is not the kind of person installing binary patches from some company that I, I,

297
00:12:57,645 --> 00:12:59,465
I've never heard of before.

298
00:12:59,674 --> 00:13:03,765
I, I don't know what I think necessarily. I guess I would view it as

299
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,940
in the open source world.

300
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,380
There are,

301
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:11,929
there are times when someone might post a patch and say here's a patch for this issue

302
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,549
and it is conceivable.

303
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:17,049
The upstream project hasn't patched it yet and people will take it and use it,

304
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,460
but it's very much a caveat emptor.

305
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,739
Right. You're, you're on your own

306
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,039
and it's not our problem. And this is basically the same thing, right?

307
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:26,619
If you can't wait for Microsoft,

308
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,559
that's your prerogative.

309
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:32,719
But if you, like, end up, you know, nailing your foot to the floor, well,

310
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,080
that's also your problem.

311
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:34,679
Right.

312
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:39,080
I don't know. I don't have a problem with it if people want to do it great.

313
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:42,719
If, if you feel like the risk of not patching is

314
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,239
greater than the risk of using

315
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:47,880
this, this potentially dodgy patch.

316
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:48,799
Ok.

317
00:13:49,099 --> 00:13:52,250
And I mean, I, yeah, I, I don't, I don't have an issue.

318
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,760
Well, my other concern would be is,

319
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,479
is what it does warranty wise when you call Microsoft Support.

320
00:13:56,489 --> 00:13:57,359
And they're like,

321
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,510
so have you made any changes to this system?

322
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,200
And your, your response is, well, funnily enough.

323
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:04,640
We, uh, we did apply a binary patch.

324
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,159
I, I suspect first of all,

325
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:08,669
the Microsoft support people aren't going to know what that means at the top,

326
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:09,760
at the front level.

327
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,849
Um, and once they do understand,

328
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,450
-- I, I,
-- in all seriousness my guess.

329
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,049
And I mean, I remember I've, I've,

330
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:19,179
I work at a place now that even does this and I've done it in the past is

331
00:14:19,349 --> 00:14:23,299
it's often run this tool and, and send me the output and then you'll get the output.

332
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:25,599
You're like, yeah, you changed a whole bunch of stuff.

333
00:14:25,609 --> 00:14:27,840
You're gonna have to install the original stuff

334
00:14:27,849 --> 00:14:29,849
and reproduce it and then I can help you

335
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,169
and that, that's almost certainly what's going to happen.

336
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,280
So, again, that leads to the, you know,

337
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:36,200
I don't really understand the market for this.

338
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,960
So, I mean, if somebody out there is using zero patch,

339
00:14:38,969 --> 00:14:42,820
please reach out to us and tell us I, I'd love to hear your use case,

340
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,020
but as I said, I just,

341
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:47,559
I have a hard time understanding the risk profile that would want this

342
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,515
and, and let's face it. There might not not be a market for this, right.

343
00:14:50,525 --> 00:14:52,395
This could be a start

344
00:14:52,575 --> 00:14:52,594
up.

345
00:14:52,705 --> 00:14:54,734
That's a problem looking for a solution.

346
00:14:54,955 --> 00:14:57,984
They've been around for a few years or a solution looking for a problem.

347
00:14:57,994 --> 00:14:58,655
That's what it is.

348
00:14:59,184 --> 00:15:02,065
I don't know. And maybe they're wildly successful.

349
00:15:02,075 --> 00:15:05,974
And now I guess, I guess however, here's one thing to think about is

350
00:15:06,369 --> 00:15:08,830
there are many organizations that don't like

351
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,190
applying the Microsoft patches because they're gigantic.

352
00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:15,630
And so there might be an appeal to saying, well, here's like a literal one line patch.

353
00:15:15,859 --> 00:15:19,820
I'm gonna choose this rather than install this pig of a Microsoft patch.

354
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,739
And then once a year I'll install the Microsoft

355
00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:23,950
Giganto patches

356
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,090
and then deal with the outcome.

357
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:30,270
Well, the classic LTs model of we only fix what's absolutely needed to be fixed.

358
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,400
We didn't improve anything. We just,

359
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,580
-- we're keeping this thing from running off the rails.
-- Right. Right.

360
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,469
Yeah, I don't know, maybe. Yeah.

361
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:41,510
So, anyway, anyway, let's, let's continue our, our news roundup episode.

362
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,280
Well, I guess the next big thing and,

363
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,320
and here's the,

364
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,099
it is

365
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,609
for you and me it would be a large amount of money.

366
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,440
But I suspect for Google,

367
00:15:49,619 --> 00:15:53,070
somebody pointed out that if, if essentially Google was a person earning a wage,

368
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,820
this would be less than one hour's wage,

369
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:57,739
you need to introduce a headline before you start talking about this.

370
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,059
Nobody knows what you mean.

371
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:02,940
-- Yeah.
-- So Google was fined. Well, I wanted to give some context for this number.

372
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:06,059
So Google was fined 57 million by French data privacy body

373
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,799
for failing to comply with the E U's GDPR regulations.

374
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:12,260
And at first I was like, oh God, data breach, what the heck happened, ah,

375
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:16,059
uh, having read the article, it, it's not that bad.

376
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:19,969
What it essentially seems to boil down to is that Google

377
00:16:21,119 --> 00:16:23,599
doesn't really inform people

378
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,140
well, if at all

379
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,979
as to what's going on privacy wise with their data.

380
00:16:27,989 --> 00:16:30,169
So it was pointed out that you need to click through

381
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:33,280
multiple screens and you need to hunt through multiple documents.

382
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,309
And ultimately for you to understand what Google is

383
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,250
doing through data would essentially require a law degree,

384
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,299
probably several 100 hours of free time

385
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:44,109
and you still wouldn't know exactly what's going on.

386
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,729
Yeah. Oh, without question,

387
00:16:45,979 --> 00:16:48,840
uh, they got fined for 57 million, which like I said,

388
00:16:48,849 --> 00:16:50,239
that sounds like a lot of money to you and me.

389
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,840
But to put it in context, if Google was a person that would be something like,

390
00:16:53,849 --> 00:16:55,409
less than an hour's wage.

391
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:55,650
Right.

392
00:16:55,659 --> 00:16:58,049
-- It's probably seven
-- minutes of, you know,

393
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,400
my last speeding ticket was more than that.

394
00:17:00,409 --> 00:17:03,020
Like, my last speeding ticket was like, two hours of my wage.

395
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:04,060
Photo

396
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:07,358
radar. Oh, no, it's not that bad, but it's just, it's photo radar. Right?

397
00:17:07,368 --> 00:17:09,819
Like they set up in zones where everybody goes a bit quick.

398
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:11,118
That's great.

399
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,858
Google's business model depends on them basically selling your information.

400
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:20,520
And I know the, the information is worth a comically low amount.

401
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:25,020
-- It's
-- selling the information to third parties either directly or indirectly.

402
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:25,939
Right.

403
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:26,858
And

404
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:31,380
they have minimal incentive to make drastic changes.

405
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:34,140
Now, if the fines continue to increase

406
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:39,260
and look, they without question, have accountants that are saying

407
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,290
this is how much money we're making with this ridiculous policy.

408
00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:43,810
This is how much the fines are.

409
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:49,000
As long as the amount of money they're making is larger enough than the fines.

410
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,349
They don't have to care.

411
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:52,329
Plus they can just spend a few 100,000 or a

412
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:54,310
million dollars fighting this in court to drag it out.

413
00:17:54,819 --> 00:17:58,420
Right. And right. It'll be in court for, I'm sure 20 years because

414
00:17:58,969 --> 00:18:02,770
they can, right. Like you and I cannot afford to pay lawyers for 20 years.

415
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,479
I probably can't afford to pay a lawyer for 20 minutes for something like this.

416
00:18:05,989 --> 00:18:10,089
And, and this is I think about this all the time is just

417
00:18:10,449 --> 00:18:15,180
some of these Gigantor companies, they, they don't have to follow the same rules.

418
00:18:15,189 --> 00:18:19,130
You and I do because in some ways they can make their own rules. And

419
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:23,280
-- I think the intent of, well, there
-- is regulatory capture is a real thing.

420
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:23,930
Sure.

421
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,290
You know, that that's a, that's a sad fact of modern life in,

422
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,829
in a lot of western democracies

423
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,880
and well, countries in general

424
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:34,680
and I have a feeling that the purpose of GDPR with their,

425
00:18:34,689 --> 00:18:37,709
their potentially ridiculously large fines

426
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,030
is to deal with this exact problem.

427
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:44,819
But I also have a strong suspicion that it isn't going to work

428
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:48,810
because until we have 20 years of case law

429
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,290
that says this is how this is going to work.

430
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,329
They're just going to drag this stuff out forever and

431
00:18:56,339 --> 00:18:58,369
by the time the case makes it to court,

432
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,310
like the world will have changed so much, it won't even matter.

433
00:19:01,469 --> 00:19:02,170
Yeah, I,

434
00:19:02,219 --> 00:19:04,410
the one thing I've seen consistently when

435
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,349
talking about crime and punishment and rehabilitation,

436
00:19:07,819 --> 00:19:09,969
one of the major deterrent to crime

437
00:19:10,489 --> 00:19:13,349
is that people have to be consistently caught and

438
00:19:13,479 --> 00:19:15,229
punished quickly

439
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:17,390
and reasonably,

440
00:19:17,619 --> 00:19:20,589
you know, if your kid or your dog does something you don't like, you don't,

441
00:19:20,969 --> 00:19:24,030
you don't bring it up 10 hours later or a day later,

442
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,030
right? They've forgotten about

443
00:19:26,209 --> 00:19:29,589
it or it's just, it's not connected enough for them to understand.

444
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,819
This is also true of people in companies.

445
00:19:32,689 --> 00:19:37,719
And so my concern is these companies can drag this out for months or years.

446
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,310
I don't think they're gonna quote unquote, learn their lesson.

447
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,479
-- Uh,
-- no, I don't, I don't think they will. And, and this is,

448
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:47,750
this is kind of fundamentally

449
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:52,229
going to be the problem with regulating cybersecurity someday, which, you know,

450
00:19:52,239 --> 00:19:53,250
is something we talk about.

451
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,760
I go back and forth constantly. I'm, I'm back to thinking regulation won't work.

452
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,910
Uh, I'm sure that in a couple of hours I'll change my mind.

453
00:19:59,270 --> 00:19:59,709
But

454
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,420
it's,

455
00:20:00,739 --> 00:20:03,920
let's say you do start just fining these companies to death.

456
00:20:04,239 --> 00:20:07,760
It, it's gonna have to be a comically large fine,

457
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,339
but you actually have to collect the fines.

458
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:10,410
That's the problem.

459
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,119
Right. Right. You have to move fast.

460
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:15,560
It's not, even if the fine is big or large, you actually have to collect it.

461
00:20:15,619 --> 00:20:18,550
And one thing I've been looking for in GDPR terms is I've been

462
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,119
looking for companies that have been fined under GDPR and we have,

463
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:22,109
now we have Google,

464
00:20:22,209 --> 00:20:23,670
there's that Canadian firm, uh,

465
00:20:23,709 --> 00:20:26,770
that was involved in Brexit and did some shenanigans and got a fine,

466
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:27,859
but they're appealing it.

467
00:20:28,219 --> 00:20:28,790
So,

468
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,640
one thing I've been looking for is places that have had to

469
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:35,359
actually pay meaningful fines and I haven't really found anything compelling.

470
00:20:35,739 --> 00:20:38,420
I haven't heard of anything at all because I know this is,

471
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,630
there's some people I'll talk to every now and then and they're saying, oh,

472
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,780
we got to take the GDPR stuff, seriously,

473
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,579
or we're going to be fined a bazillion dollars.

474
00:20:44,589 --> 00:20:48,250
And it said, show me a single company that's been fined this, right? Like,

475
00:20:48,369 --> 00:20:50,630
-- because here, so, and I guess here's the other half
-- of this,

476
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,560
show me a company that's actually paid this fine,

477
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,800
-- right? Ok.
-- That's fair. You know, this reminds me of all these environmental laws.

478
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:59,719
Here's the other half with something like GDPR is

479
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:04,319
the goal of the regulators isn't like they're not out to get you,

480
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,369
they're out to help you do the right thing.

481
00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:09,640
And so as long as you pretend to like you care,

482
00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:12,280
they're, they're on your side fundamentally. Right.

483
00:21:12,449 --> 00:21:13,040
And

484
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:13,800
that's,

485
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:16,160
I'm sure Google is pretending to care.

486
00:21:16,449 --> 00:21:18,160
But my, I have a suspicion

487
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:19,569
there, there are,

488
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,540
there are definitely people who do carry Google so don't get me wrong there.

489
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:26,030
I'm not going to say they're super evil, but there's also a bunch of people who don't.

490
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,349
Well, the problem is Google's 100,000 people.

491
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,510
It's a country. Exactly.

492
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,050
And I'm sure they have a lot

493
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,229
of internally inconsistent views on everything including,

494
00:21:35,489 --> 00:21:38,189
uh, well, ok, to bring up something utterly ridiculous.

495
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:41,109
Remember the discussion at Red Hat about the removal

496
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:43,260
of the paper towel dispensers in the bathrooms.

497
00:21:44,979 --> 00:21:45,810
Yes.

498
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:48,150
And I mean, how many

499
00:21:48,449 --> 00:21:51,689
-- people got involved in that discussion?
-- Everybody.

500
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:52,579
It was,

501
00:21:52,699 --> 00:21:55,369
and OSHA was invoked and

502
00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:01,510
just, wow, it, it was a big deal. So, I mean, and that's paper towels in the bathroom.

503
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,630
It was epic.

504
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:07,000
And so something like privacy on a global scale. Like,

505
00:22:07,579 --> 00:22:08,420
-- sorry. But
-- I,

506
00:22:09,189 --> 00:22:10,260
I know, man,

507
00:22:10,449 --> 00:22:11,109
it's,

508
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:15,319
I know, I know. And I don't think we ever got paper towels back. Did we?

509
00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:18,900
I feel like I feel like no, maybe, maybe in a couple offices.

510
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,770
That was that? Oh, that's right.

511
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,079
I remember that was the amusing thing is I'd go visit our

512
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:26,349
offices in Europe and they got them but the US offices didn't,

513
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:26,670
uh,

514
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:27,449
for

515
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:29,660
-- probably GDPR or something.
-- I don't know.

516
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:33,199
And there's probably some European directive on Hannah washing that involves

517
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:37,239
I, who knows, whatever, whatever it was

518
00:22:37,609 --> 00:22:39,880
anyway. But, but yeah, you're absolutely right.

519
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:44,010
-- It's big companies are,
-- it's no, it's, it's groups of people. It doesn't matter.

520
00:22:44,939 --> 00:22:47,119
-- You've played
-- D and D has your party ever agreed

521
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,119
consistently?

522
00:22:48,489 --> 00:22:48,859
No,

523
00:22:51,099 --> 00:22:53,199
I'm trying to think of an instance and I can't.

524
00:22:54,329 --> 00:22:55,040
So

525
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,400
there is, there's always, but it's, it's any group of people.

526
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,709
There's always lots of people who are just

527
00:23:02,209 --> 00:23:04,300
anyway, people are people that's,

528
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:08,979
let's keep moving. We've got one more fun story to talk about, uh, Mastercard.

529
00:23:08,989 --> 00:23:10,030
Why don't you explain this one?

530
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,739
Yeah. So this one I really like, it's

531
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,800
when you sign up for a free trial, a

532
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:17,109
lot of them require credit card number.

533
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:17,930
Uh,

534
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:19,660
ostensibly,

535
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,750
ostensibly the reason is to make sure you're a real

536
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,030
person or that you're not abusing the free trial,

537
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,810
you know, one per customer kind of deal because most people don't have more than

538
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,150
I'm hoping. Two or three credit cards.

539
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:29,760
Right.

540
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,420
You sign up for a free trial

541
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:34,619
and you're either satisfied or dissatisfied with it.

542
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,819
So then you try, well, if you're,

543
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:38,030
if you're satisfied, you continue, you pay

544
00:23:38,219 --> 00:23:38,719
whatever,

545
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:41,069
but if you're dissatisfied or don't care,

546
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,530
sometimes

547
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,150
unsubscribing or getting them to not bill, you can be

548
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,770
impossible

549
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:51,609
in fairness. Uh, especially with some of these multilevel marketing scams

550
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:55,880
where, you know, I'm going to send you a free promo gift box of

551
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:59,410
essential oils or whatever garbage they're peddling

552
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,290
and

553
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,719
you get that and implicit in that is, you know,

554
00:24:02,729 --> 00:24:04,739
you've now signed a contract that you're committing to buying

555
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,119
like 250 bucks for this stuff every month or whatever.

556
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:11,290
And you're expected to flog that on to your friends and family or whatever,

557
00:24:11,489 --> 00:24:13,689
getting out of those things can basically be a nightmare.

558
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:20,020
So it looks like basically Mastercard is making it possible to

559
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:23,310
cancel more easily because here we go to help cardholders with that decision.

560
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:27,199
Merchants will be required to send the cardholder either by email or text

561
00:24:27,979 --> 00:24:29,959
the transaction amount, payment date,

562
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:33,359
merchant name along with explicit instructions on how to cancel a trial.

563
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,819
So hopefully it's easier for people to cancel these stupid things

564
00:24:37,829 --> 00:24:40,520
and these companies that prey on people for getting to.

565
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,699
Well, a great example, the cable company has been selling my parents

566
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,500
the same 15 megabit down one megabit up internet for about a

567
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:50,079
decade now and they're paying 70 bucks a month for it and

568
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:55,660
for $55 a month you can get 300 megabit symmetrical now, locally.

569
00:24:55,689 --> 00:24:58,290
That's fantastic from another company and you can

570
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,229
even get a better deal from that company.

571
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:00,609
So,

572
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:04,280
you know, I'm going to name it. Shaw. Shame on you. Shaw. My parents trusted you

573
00:25:04,579 --> 00:25:08,770
-- and you dick
-- them. I'm, I'm shocked a cable company would do this there. I know me too.

574
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,650
Beacons of honesty and integrity in society. Kurt.

575
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,140
Yeah, it's uh

576
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:17,510
-- not that the phone company is any better but whatever
-- the phone company is worse.

577
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,030
-- Look,
-- it's a different flavor.

578
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:21,790
It's right. They're, they're all terrible and

579
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:27,589
it is, man. II, I like the fact that Mastercard is doing this because

580
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,719
this is problematic and I think

581
00:25:29,729 --> 00:25:33,119
it's especially problematic with the older generations

582
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:33,920
where

583
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:38,150
I have, I have seen, I'll use my parents as the example I have.

584
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,400
I have more than once said, like, why do you have this?

585
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:42,640
They said, oh, we don't know how to cancel it. We gave up

586
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,119
said that's not the right answer.

587
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,109
You call the credit card company and tell them

588
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:48,839
what's going on and they will deal with it.

589
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:49,239
And

590
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,719
I, I guess here's the thing. I keep thinking of

591
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,959
what's the angle for Mastercard here?

592
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,560
Is it just that customers like them more or,

593
00:25:56,569 --> 00:25:58,400
or do you think there's some sort of other business?

594
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:02,630
Mastercard isn't really technically doing anything other than forcing

595
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,859
a certain level of transparency onto the merchant.

596
00:26:04,869 --> 00:26:05,130
So they,

597
00:26:05,849 --> 00:26:07,040
so I'll put it blunt,

598
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:10,229
Mastercard is taking a cost center handling charge

599
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:12,930
backs and angry customers and Externalizing it.

600
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:14,800
So something might be right

601
00:26:15,069 --> 00:26:17,619
because I bet chargebacks are,

602
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:18,489
well, it would,

603
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,170
it wouldn't shock me if there's a lot of additional costs

604
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:25,479
we don't see or understand in that industry around charge backs.

605
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:26,969
It's not just saying

606
00:26:27,239 --> 00:26:30,040
of, uh, you know, merchant, I'm taking money away from you.

607
00:26:30,109 --> 00:26:33,130
I I think that transparency is good because quite frankly,

608
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:33,989
what's that famous quote?

609
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,890
You know, if you're doing something that

610
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,969
you would be ashamed to do in public,

611
00:26:39,459 --> 00:26:42,599
maybe, you know, that's not the right thing to do and,

612
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:45,099
and obviously society changes and things that used

613
00:26:45,109 --> 00:26:47,239
to be shameful or no longer shameful like

614
00:26:47,729 --> 00:26:48,150
uh

615
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,910
well or things that were

616
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,920
OK are now shameful, like say smoking in the car with your baby.

617
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,760
But I think in this case,

618
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:58,780
forcing merchants to provide a degree of basic transparency.

619
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:02,079
Like I mean, come on the transaction amount, the payment date

620
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:05,319
and the merchant name, come on. You can't argue against that

621
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,849
and the explicit instructions on how to cancel a trial. Again,

622
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,359
that's a basic level of transparency and honesty that II I

623
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,119
think should be required.

624
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:15,119
That's fair,

625
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:16,079
that's fair.

626
00:27:16,089 --> 00:27:19,859
And it also makes it easier for Mastercard probably to handle charge backs when

627
00:27:19,869 --> 00:27:21,140
they don't do this because now they're

628
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:23,640
in violation of their card processing agreement.

629
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:25,339
Yeah, that's, that's a good point.

630
00:27:25,849 --> 00:27:31,160
So, actually I, I have a story to tell about this as well. So my daughter has an ipad

631
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:32,439
and

632
00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:35,349
I got an email over the weekend that said,

633
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:38,079
you congratulations on signing up for this service.

634
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,560
And I looked at her and I said, what did you sign up for?

635
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,500
And she goes, oh,

636
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:45,030
I downloaded this video editing program because she's like she wants to,

637
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,680
she's working on her youtube channel intro, right?

638
00:27:47,689 --> 00:27:47,810
For

639
00:27:48,329 --> 00:27:49,849
the youtube channel she's going to make

640
00:27:50,459 --> 00:27:51,390
and I said, well, you know,

641
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,979
they're going to charge you five bucks a month

642
00:27:52,989 --> 00:27:55,479
right after the first like 12 days or whatever.

643
00:27:55,489 --> 00:27:59,760
She said, yeah, I, I uninstalled the app and I said that's probably not enough.

644
00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:02,560
And, but it was really nice though because you, we went into the

645
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,760
wait. She has a credit card.

646
00:28:03,939 --> 00:28:06,400
Well, no, but she has itunes credit,

647
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:07,699
right? Like I

648
00:28:07,969 --> 00:28:08,160
assume the

649
00:28:08,609 --> 00:28:11,030
your credit and then just like magically cancel.

650
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:15,949
But at the same time, it's like this is actually really nice because Apple has made it

651
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:18,630
like there's just a, there's a tick box or not a tick box.

652
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,430
So it's like a section in your account that just says

653
00:28:20,439 --> 00:28:24,589
subscriptions and you click it and say unsubscribe and it's gone.

654
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:25,739
Right. That is

655
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,709
awesome.

656
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:27,699
And it's,

657
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:30,819
and, and I guess at the same time

658
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,849
when you have like that walled garden environment,

659
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:37,579
they can get away with that because Apple can say you do it our way or screw you.

660
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,500
And the thing to remember too is a lot of, well,

661
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,790
especially for subscriptions with software.

662
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:45,689
The marginal cost of me servicing one extra customer is basically zero.

663
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:46,969
So it's just

664
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:47,969
free money.

665
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:48,530
And

666
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:51,849
yeah, Apple has a market and a brand worth protecting.

667
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:53,609
Same, same as mastercard.

668
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,060
I,

669
00:28:54,069 --> 00:28:57,500
I have a Visa and a Mastercard and I've actually started

670
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:01,859
using my Visa and I've stopped using my Mastercard pretty much

671
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,750
because Mastercard was difficult to get a hold of for something.

672
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,209
And I started using Visa and I actually had to do a

673
00:29:06,219 --> 00:29:08,359
charge back on a couch because we bought a couch and they

674
00:29:08,589 --> 00:29:10,810
never delivered the damn thing. The couch saga,

675
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,619
we paid for this thing back in October.

676
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,310
And so when I phoned Visa, it was

677
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,010
somewhat annoying to get a hold of them.

678
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,579
But once I finally did the charge

679
00:29:19,589 --> 00:29:22,229
back process literally consisted of which transaction,

680
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:22,739
which date?

681
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,349
Ok. T

682
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:26,060
tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. Let me put you on hold for a minute

683
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,619
and then she came back and she's like, ok,

684
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:30,079
the charge back will be issued on your next billing cycle.

685
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:30,810
Thanks. Bye.

686
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,180
And I'm like, that's it.

687
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:34,420
Like I, I assumed I'd have to send in a piece of

688
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:36,339
like a copy of the receipt or something.

689
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:39,969
-- But no, just
-- boom, I've had no trouble with Visa.

690
00:29:39,979 --> 00:29:42,209
I've never tried to do a charge Act of mastercard.

691
00:29:42,329 --> 00:29:42,849
It's,

692
00:29:42,979 --> 00:29:44,250
but no, no, here's,

693
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,810
here's something to think about.

694
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:52,920
If, if Apple or rather, if, if the, the subscription my daughter signed up for,

695
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:56,280
if she got charged that I would blame Apple.

696
00:29:56,689 --> 00:29:59,689
But when I use my credit card to sign up for some scam thing and

697
00:29:59,699 --> 00:30:03,640
I get like a charge for something I didn't know I was signing up for,

698
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:08,310
I don't blame the credit card company. I blame myself and the other company. Right.

699
00:30:08,829 --> 00:30:11,890
Well, and Apple too. Uh, let's face it. They,

700
00:30:12,069 --> 00:30:13,349
it's, it's worth it.

701
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,430
I suspect because the cost of hiring humans to answer the phone and deal

702
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:20,660
with angry customers would be a lot more than just providing those check boxes

703
00:30:20,949 --> 00:30:25,229
without question. So, II, I really like when companies

704
00:30:25,349 --> 00:30:27,439
accidentally or intentionally even

705
00:30:27,729 --> 00:30:31,270
make our lives easier because they want to cut costs and I'm ok with that.

706
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:36,060
-- Yep. I, I agree 100%. You know,
-- unfortunately, it goes the other way sometimes. But

707
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:37,630
I think in this case

708
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,650
that basic level of transparency

709
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,650
I, I think should not just be for trial offers. I think that should be for everything.

710
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,219
I mean, shouldn't your receipt say

711
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,420
well, because you've been in this situation,

712
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,760
no doubt where you get a charge on your

713
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:50,040
credit card and you're looking at and you're like,

714
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,880
what company is that?

715
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:52,880
Yes.

716
00:30:53,089 --> 00:30:53,599
Yes.

717
00:30:53,729 --> 00:30:57,280
Like tech Savvy Internet goes by T si. Ok. That makes sense

718
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,599
when you say it. But

719
00:30:58,939 --> 00:31:00,880
you know, my friend is looking at her credit cards

720
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:01,839
and

721
00:31:01,949 --> 00:31:03,949
she's like, what the heck is T si,

722
00:31:04,439 --> 00:31:04,790
you know,

723
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,959
I can't handle. T si, it's a three letter acronym.

724
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:09,290
I, I had many things that their,

725
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:14,219
their credit card merchant name is nothing like what they are

726
00:31:14,489 --> 00:31:15,050
and

727
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,709
yeah. No, it'd be nice but

728
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:17,660
-- I
-- love it.

729
00:31:17,719 --> 00:31:19,199
I get an email now every time I make

730
00:31:19,209 --> 00:31:22,550
a credit card purchase that's processed outside of the,

731
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,750
it's processed from outside of Canada.

732
00:31:26,109 --> 00:31:28,819
So some of that I expect like say Amazon,

733
00:31:29,609 --> 00:31:32,869
but some of it when I'm buying from a Canadian company and then I get this alert email.

734
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,109
I'm like, where is that coming from over there? And

735
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:38,030
what is this, you know, the merchant name on it is just,

736
00:31:38,189 --> 00:31:41,630
I mean, it's the same amount as I literally just 30 seconds ago, bought online.

737
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,310
But it's

738
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,020
like,

739
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:45,510
you know, if I had to reconcile these a month later,

740
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,069
I certainly wouldn't know who that is.

741
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,729
Oh, definitely. Yep. Yep. Absolutely.

742
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,949
Ok. Well, anyway, anyway, we should wrap this one up. So,

743
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:55,619
yeah, I guess. Good job mastercard.

744
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,589
That's,

745
00:31:57,199 --> 00:31:58,030
that's all I'll say.

746
00:31:58,819 --> 00:32:00,959
Yeah, I, I hope all the credit card companies do this.

747
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:04,459
Indeed. Indeed. Well, we probably only need one.

748
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:07,520
I, what isn't mastercard the most used card in the world?

749
00:32:07,989 --> 00:32:09,280
I think I have no idea.

750
00:32:09,569 --> 00:32:12,760
-- Might be. I thought Visa
-- was by transaction volume. The highest is it? It

751
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:13,319
might be.

752
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:15,199
I don't know, whatever my guess though.

753
00:32:15,209 --> 00:32:19,020
Is, there are very few shops I've seen that don't take Mastercard.

754
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:21,079
I can't think of a single one.

755
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:21,969
So

756
00:32:22,189 --> 00:32:23,760
I have a suspicion. This will,

757
00:32:24,329 --> 00:32:28,979
this will catch on for everybody whether you want it or not. Which, why wouldn't you?

758
00:32:29,229 --> 00:32:31,660
Oh, wow. Mastercard is

759
00:32:31,989 --> 00:32:35,319
debit cards with the vi oh no, it's a visa is definitely bigger than Mastercard.

760
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:37,750
But the two of them are like 56% of the whole industry.

761
00:32:38,369 --> 00:32:41,979
-- I thought they were more than that. I'm surprised at that
-- level. Globally.

762
00:32:41,989 --> 00:32:45,510
You gotta remember. There's a lot of non visa, non Mastercard stuff,

763
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:48,040
smaller stuff in other countries or even in Canada.

764
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,349
Well, and then there's, the whole debit card is a blank thing and

765
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,689
-- all sorts of mix and match things.
-- Now,

766
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,699
that's fair. That's fair. All right, so cool. I'm,

767
00:32:56,819 --> 00:32:59,949

774
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:13,959
don't forget to check your uh credit card statements for weird charges.

775
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,420
That's right.

776
