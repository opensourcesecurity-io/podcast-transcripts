Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 157 with myself,

1
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:13,039
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:15,210
-- Well,
-- we're back. How are you doing?

3
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:19,659
Good. And uh I just noticed 157 is a quasi prime number.

4
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:19,979
Oh,

5
00:00:20,469 --> 00:00:21,659
my goodness.

6
00:00:22,069 --> 00:00:27,360
-- Yeah. Is it, is it like what it rhymes or something? I forget it's
-- not divisible by 24

7
00:00:28,049 --> 00:00:30,040
as I believe the first step

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,650
and then you make a table of roots and squares

9
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:37,080
and start deleting the ones that are divisible by nine

10
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,090
and then you take a square root or something.

11
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:43,520
But see, but the thing is because it uses nano time.

12
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:47,000
Remember it uses nano time to create the encryption algorithm using these

13
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:50,330
quasi prime numbers and based on music theory that never repeats.

14
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:55,479
All right. So for those of you who think Kurt has lost his mind, which he probably has.

15
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,060
There was, there was a black hat presentation that was,

16
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:02,950
I don't even think calling it Snake oil. Does it justice, right? It was

17
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,980
-- AAA
-- sponsored presentation.

18
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:09,949
That's the best. It wasn't, it was a sponsored vendor sponsored presentation.

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,580
It, it's beautiful.

20
00:01:11,589 --> 00:01:17,650
We will put a link in the show notes to a recorded talk by the company in question.

21
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,459
But it is,

22
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:24,819
it is beautiful to say the least the crap they make up and the claims they make are

23
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:30,650
I couldn't come up with this in my wildest dreams. It is beautiful. It's like poetry.

24
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,540
The thing I loved about it was, it was such a dense mishmash of crypto

25
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,120
buzzwords and like they were using legitimate

26
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:42,160
words like all the words and grammatically,

27
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:42,339
it, it

28
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:43,519
is grammatic.

29
00:01:43,529 --> 00:01:47,559
Like if you put it through a grammar checker, it would, it's actually sentences, but

30
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:51,489
the actual content is so bizarrely insane.

31
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,519
Like talking about music theory and nano time and

32
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,279
you know,

33
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,739
uh giving up something about how it would specifically take,

34
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,379
they gave an actual specific number of

35
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:04,029
like 31,279 years or something specific to like

36
00:02:04,309 --> 00:02:07,400
-- to, to crack or repeat this thing or something. Like it
-- was just

37
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,750
the Jabberwocky poem applied to crypto.

38
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,500
That is what it is.

39
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,649
It's beautiful.

40
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:17,809
It's utter beauty but also nonsense. Yeah.

41
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,410
And, but the problem is

42
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,050
-- they've got investors
-- well, with words like that.

43
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,080
So, so some people, so, so some people believe this and, and my,

44
00:02:27,089 --> 00:02:29,240
my thought was I looked at this and I tweeted about this is like,

45
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,000
how do we tell this apart from?

46
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,679
Well, for example, like a project I'm working on where it's like, oh,

47
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,419
we have like provably,

48
00:02:35,429 --> 00:02:37,910
you know random noise data in our Blockchain

49
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,270
that you can use to validate your records.

50
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:42,449
But like, we totally don't have your data because blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

51
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:42,800
right.

52
00:02:42,809 --> 00:02:44,250
Words hashes

53
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:44,869
you know,

54
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,300
nonsense that are randomly generated on your side and we don't know what they are.

55
00:02:48,899 --> 00:02:49,669
Uh Right.

56
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:50,759
How do you, how do you,

57
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,399
they both like honestly when I give the dense version of what I'm talking about,

58
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:58,470
it's like it kind of sounds the same, just a lot shorter and less music theory.

59
00:02:58,559 --> 00:03:01,660
You tweeted that and I replied to you, but I

60
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:05,520
this is a good opportunity to, to kind of expand on it a little bit.

61
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:06,199
This one

62
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,929
a problem in things like medicine

63
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,490
a couple 100 years ago

64
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,169
and

65
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,729
it, it kind of still is in medicine in some ways.

66
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,679
I mean, I would lump some of like the anti vaccination arguments in this.

67
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,199
Oh, you want to see something horrifying,

68
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:23,610
go look up cures for autism and what some of these people are doing to their kids.

69
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:28,699
I will not because that sounds terrible. Nor will I link to such a thing either?

70
00:03:29,029 --> 00:03:31,960
-- And that's
-- no, it's beyond terrible.

71
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,250
That's a good comparison. And so

72
00:03:34,529 --> 00:03:37,839
one of the challenges we have in security and this is something

73
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:43,039
I know we've been talking about forever is this isn't like a scientific field,

74
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:43,389
right?

75
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:46,009
There's medicine where you go to school,

76
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,600
you study the science of medicine,

77
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,960
there's reproducible tests,

78
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:51,770
right?

79
00:03:51,779 --> 00:03:53,679
What happens every time you and I ask for somebody

80
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,039
with a strong opinion that they present as fact.

81
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:57,419
And we're like, cool,

82
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,119
like, what is that opinion based on as far as data goes? And

83
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,550
-- it
-- never stops him either.

84
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,580
Like, literally the only people I've seen doing actual data are,

85
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:12,070
you know, like Google and like Miter attack and a few very like, literally,

86
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,020
I can count them on one hand,

87
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,449
the number of people who've made decisions,

88
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:17,160
like the nist guy is great.

89
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,019
Like back in the day, passwords should be complex, we should rotate them.

90
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:21,440
Yeah, we, we honestly thought that was true.

91
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,809
And then they basically gathered a bunch of data that is password

92
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,190
failure in the industry for the last 20 years or so.

93
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:27,869
And they're like,

94
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:28,929
whoops,

95
00:04:29,049 --> 00:04:30,140
we were wrong,

96
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,000
you know, and the data is that

97
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,040
clearly, you know,

98
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:36,309
based on password breaches and the people choosing like password password,

99
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,380
123123456789, whatever, this doesn't work, you know,

100
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,420
there's some actual data out there, like, have I been

101
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:42,869
pwned kind

102
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:43,799
of good data set?

103
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:44,869
And

104
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,890
literally those are like everything else, you know,

105
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:50,230
I'm fine with people having opinions.

106
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:51,149
I have opinions, but

107
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,350
when people present them as fact, with no

108
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:58,750
-- evidence, it's like, hm,
-- well, this is beyond the realm of opinion, even

109
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,149
this is somebody with

110
00:05:01,859 --> 00:05:05,679
just lies, let's face it. They're lies, let's call them what they are.

111
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,350
They have a collection of lies

112
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:12,149
and they're presenting it as actual information and

113
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,750
we have no structure or mechanism in our industry

114
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:19,829
to disprove any of this in a scientific manner.

115
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:20,230
Well,

116
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:22,970
you could sort of disprove it but who's going to take it

117
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,019
on themselves to spend a couple 100 grand to disprove this?

118
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:28,029
Right. What's the benefit to them of disproving this?

119
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,540
I don't think you could though Kurt,

120
00:05:29,549 --> 00:05:32,570
I think these are the sort of people that even if you

121
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:36,500
say took all of their arguments and you laid them down mathematically and

122
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:41,589
you showed why our current understanding of crypto in prime numbers and

123
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,829
just math in general doesn't line up with any of these claims.

124
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:48,570
They're gonna come back with counterclaims that are hogwash.

125
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:49,089
Well, they've,

126
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,869
they've already done that where they basically claim

127
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,290
that this is new crypto like this is,

128
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:55,290
you know, this always happens with new stuff.

129
00:05:55,299 --> 00:05:57,670
Right. Exactly. That. Exactly that.

130
00:05:57,679 --> 00:06:00,540
And what's the, who has someone has a quote that like

131
00:06:00,739 --> 00:06:05,049
the energy needed to refute bullshit is, you know, magnitudes higher

132
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:06,364
and energy needs to

133
00:06:06,635 --> 00:06:06,755
create

134
00:06:06,915 --> 00:06:08,975
it. And that's exactly what this is.

135
00:06:08,984 --> 00:06:12,204
-- Well,
-- we're still dealing with anti vaxxers despite Andrew, what is it?

136
00:06:12,214 --> 00:06:13,355
Andrew Wakefield being,

137
00:06:13,554 --> 00:06:17,565
you know, convicted struck from the register, all this evidence,

138
00:06:17,864 --> 00:06:18,565
you know,

139
00:06:18,665 --> 00:06:19,744
it's just

140
00:06:20,785 --> 00:06:22,804
sorry, this is something very personal to me.

141
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:24,964
But anyways, it's, it's very frustrating and it's,

142
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:26,709
yeah, like

143
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,410
there's still

144
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:33,089
like measles is back. That's how bad anti vaccine is that measles is back. Like

145
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:37,019
there's news reports, like somebody traveled through my local airport,

146
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,500
went to a Walmart, did some stuff traveled on

147
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,220
and like shed measles for like four hours around the place.

148
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:43,950
And so they, you know,

149
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,760
there's a public news story about this saying if you were

150
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:48,029
at the airport of this Walmart or whatever at this time,

151
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,429
like, and you have a compromised immune system, like, man, it sucks to be you,

152
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,290
you probably should go see your doctor right away.

153
00:06:53,299 --> 00:06:55,529
And it's like I thought we fixed that,

154
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,420
-- didn't we?
-- Well, we we did, but then things happened.

155
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:04,130
I mean, this is kind of the same story is how do you refute this

156
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,010
when

157
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,529
you have the people who are delivering the message

158
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:12,380
are emotionally invested in this and then the people listening

159
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:16,019
don't actually understand the science behind it.

160
00:07:16,179 --> 00:07:18,299
Well, the other thing too is, is not just you have to refute it,

161
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:19,820
you have to get people to believe it,

162
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:20,739
right?

163
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,570
And I'm not sure I, I think I might put myself in this category. I'm not even sure.

164
00:07:24,739 --> 00:07:28,059
For example, what, what clearly defines evidence like seriously when,

165
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:31,140
when you present me with so called evidence to refute something,

166
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:32,739
how do I know that evidence is correct?

167
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,859
Well, you said, so it was peer reviewed,

168
00:07:35,429 --> 00:07:37,869
you know, like people still argue with the whole climate change thing.

169
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,980
And what is that like 98 or 99% of scientists are now saying it's,

170
00:07:40,989 --> 00:07:44,149
it's a legit thing and people are like, yeah, but that 1% that says it's

171
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:49,559
so let's let's not go into that space because that's a different problem, I think.

172
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:53,549
But let's look at kind of the context of medicine is there are

173
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,579
professional medical associations

174
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:57,899
and

175
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:01,299
if you make false claims, they kick you out

176
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:04,489
and we could look at something like the world of crypto,

177
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,260
there's no professional crypto associations, right?

178
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:09,609
We have something like nest where they would

179
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:12,459
say here are the crypto algorithms that are good

180
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,660
and here are the crypto algorithms that are banned.

181
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:18,940
-- But that's kind of another level up.
-- Yeah. Well, I agree because the

182
00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:19,660
black,

183
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:23,299
there's a lot of encryption vendors that have their own encryption and they're,

184
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:23,760
you know, they,

185
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:27,279
some of it sounds a bit wonky, some of it sounds pretty legit.

186
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,040
But, you know, I was looking at some stuff where it's like this,

187
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:34,150
this thing to do one time pad key streams for certificates

188
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:36,580
in the cloud, blah, blah, blah, some other stuff.

189
00:08:36,869 --> 00:08:41,650
And it seemed mostly legit like the most of the primitives they were using

190
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:44,948
were primitives. I know the names of and like, recognize.

191
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,929
So they're not like at least they're not making their own primitives, right?

192
00:08:47,939 --> 00:08:48,439
Like that.

193
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:51,568
Like when people start inventing new math for crypto, that's when I'm just like,

194
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:51,629
yeah.

195
00:08:51,638 --> 00:08:52,158
No,

196
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:55,518
you know that you can do that, but it takes about 10 to 20 years

197
00:08:55,658 --> 00:08:57,939
they did it over Christmas break. Yes. Yeah.

198
00:08:57,948 --> 00:08:58,218
That,

199
00:08:58,229 --> 00:09:01,729
that was my favorite part of the claim is that he invented this over Christmas break.

200
00:09:01,739 --> 00:09:02,119
And it's like,

201
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:03,289
was it,

202
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,960
is there some country where Christmas break is, like, 10 years long?

203
00:09:05,969 --> 00:09:08,150
Because two weeks, I don't think it's gonna cut it.

204
00:09:08,219 --> 00:09:12,840
-- I
-- want to live in that country because I could use a 10 year long Christmas break.

205
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,440
But that's the problem even.

206
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,390
I, you know, I've been doing crypto, I've,

207
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,210
I've actually read Bruce Schneier's applied cryptography, you know,

208
00:09:19,219 --> 00:09:20,979
so I probably know a little bit more than the average payer.

209
00:09:20,989 --> 00:09:21,299
But

210
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:26,390
even listening to these vendors at blackout, I'm like, it sounds legit, the,

211
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,049
the pictures look reasonably correct with the way the arrows point around.

212
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,059
But like for all, I know there could be a huge gaping hole in the thing.

213
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:38,299
And even if the math is solid, the implementation likely is not

214
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:41,119
because those are two different problems.

215
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:44,900
-- Also, you can have good math and bad implementation
-- because humans wrote it.

216
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:45,869
Exactly.

217
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,210
I would actually argue it's having a good

218
00:09:48,219 --> 00:09:50,630
implementation is damn near impossible because I mean,

219
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,059
everybody look, look at how many security flaws we've had in open SSL open SSH,

220
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,520
-- you name it, it, it is
-- completely impossible.

221
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,479
And this, in fact,

222
00:09:58,489 --> 00:10:01,590
I just wrote a blog post kind of about this where I don't

223
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,570
remember if you were in the Twitter conversation that brought this up.

224
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,609
But basically I asked the question. All right.

225
00:10:06,619 --> 00:10:10,299
So we expect to train people to not write security flaws in their code.

226
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,309
But do, do we talk about training people and then not write bugs in their code?

227
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,625
And of course we don't because that's the most ridiculous thing anyone said,

228
00:10:17,635 --> 00:10:19,044
but it's the same problem.

229
00:10:19,054 --> 00:10:20,924
Security flaws are bugs.

230
00:10:21,034 --> 00:10:23,544
We can't teach people to not write bugs.

231
00:10:23,554 --> 00:10:27,354
Therefore, we can't teach people to not write security flaws just full stop and,

232
00:10:27,474 --> 00:10:31,224
-- and
-- actually security flaws are worse in the sense of many of them are not obvious.

233
00:10:31,234 --> 00:10:34,104
Like if, if the site is the wrong color or the font,

234
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:37,594
like we had an issue where the font had like an underscore under the font in the title.

235
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:40,544
And we're like, ok, you know, that's visually obvious like that. What's wonky?

236
00:10:40,554 --> 00:10:44,335
What the heck? Oh, you know, the, the font file was something like Magic Web.

237
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:45,065
I don't know, man.

238
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,239
Web's complicated now, the whole CS S thing just blows my mind.

239
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,320
It's like, true and complete.

240
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,710
It's true and complete. So,

241
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,280
yeah.

242
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:53,239
And, uh,

243
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:54,940
I mean,

244
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,119
I, I think the good news though is

245
00:10:57,489 --> 00:10:59,130
in some ways we're making progress because

246
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,679
at least we're having these discussions,

247
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:03,099
like, like this guy actually got called out

248
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:06,419
on being probably a snake oil salesman,

249
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:09,840
you know, on Twitter and there's a lot of press about it. So that's good.

250
00:11:09,849 --> 00:11:14,909
And I mean, well, with a, here's a rather ugly, brutal segue but

251
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,400
to, you know, the Attorney General Barn Encryption

252
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,059
Schneier

253
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:20,320
talks about it and he points out that at least now

254
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:23,549
the conversation is moving from, hey, you guys, I love this quote.

255
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:26,919
You just need to nerd harder and like make a bunch of backdoors and

256
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:30,145
stuff that are like magically secure and safe for the government to use.

257
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:31,304
But the bad guys can't use

258
00:11:31,604 --> 00:11:34,674
and we're, we're moving away from that argument which is obviously like,

259
00:11:34,684 --> 00:11:36,594
ain't gonna work too security versus security.

260
00:11:36,604 --> 00:11:38,895
Like, let's talk about tradeoffs, right? We want,

261
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,945
ok, you guys want secure communications.

262
00:11:40,955 --> 00:11:43,604
Well, actually most people want that and so do we cool.

263
00:11:43,614 --> 00:11:46,364
But we also want maybe law enforcement to be able to do their job,

264
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:50,184
which means law enforcement wants to be able to listen into things in real time.

265
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,400
So let's talk security tradeoffs.

266
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:56,599
Let's back this up a minute and explain what's going on here.

267
00:11:56,609 --> 00:11:59,320
So the attorney general of the United States

268
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,159
has brought out the old boogeyman again of,

269
00:12:02,169 --> 00:12:06,099
we need to backdoor crypto except this time, like you just said,

270
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:09,109
he's not saying we can actually technically do this.

271
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:12,239
He's saying, yeah, we know it's insecure, but we don't care, do it anyway.

272
00:12:12,369 --> 00:12:14,510
And that's a different conversation

273
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,880
than we've ever had before.

274
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,229
And it's even more interesting in that he's saying

275
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,419
we need to do this for consumer technologies.

276
00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:23,669
We won't attack what big business uses

277
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,489
which shows a fundamental flaw in understanding.

278
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,250
-- That's all the same stuff, man.
-- It it is. Look, let's face it.

279
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,150
They want to backdoor the chat apps,

280
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,010
there's encrypted chat apps and they want backdoors in them.

281
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:40,890
And then that's fundamentally what we're talking about here.

282
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,609
The thing is though, as far as I know those are the same things most companies use.

283
00:12:44,619 --> 00:12:45,640
-- Of
-- course, they do.

284
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,679
What I find interesting is

285
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:50,250
I feel like it's a thin end of the wedge. OK?

286
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,570
We tried this brute force approach of everything. No, that won't work.

287
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,520
OK. Let's try the thin end of the wedge because, you know,

288
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:00,489
here's the, here's a frustrating point is when you attack a company,

289
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:01,799
if they're not that big,

290
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:03,679
not that savvy, you can probably get away with it.

291
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:04,489
And by attack, I mean,

292
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,609
like legally attack and force them into legislation and stuff or, you know,

293
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:09,280
a company like Google or Facebook,

294
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,820
like they have full time lobbyists living and working in DC,

295
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:17,010
but I'm guessing signal probably doesn't have a huge team of lobbyists

296
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:20,099
and that guy that released an open source project on github,

297
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,969
pretty much for sure.

298
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:23,070
Exactly.

299
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,229
I mean, that's one of the difficulties but,

300
00:13:25,599 --> 00:13:27,739
but even in the context of Facebook,

301
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,419
I know I read an article shortly after

302
00:13:30,429 --> 00:13:33,659
this all started coming out where even Facebook was

303
00:13:33,929 --> 00:13:38,369
starting to investigate how they can do client site analysis of messages.

304
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,869
So they aren't necessarily

305
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,869
doing any shenanigans on the wire.

306
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,229
It's a matter of let's put something in the app to look for keywords, let's say,

307
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:49,869
and then we can forward those messages somewhere else.

308
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:53,530
Well, and that's actually a somewhat valid use case because people ask me, you know,

309
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:55,750
Kurt, what about end to end encryption for email?

310
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,510
And I'm like, it's terrible. You don't want it. And they're like, no, I want it.

311
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,950
I want end to end encryption. I'm like, you really don't

312
00:14:01,562 --> 00:14:02,151
because

313
00:14:02,492 --> 00:14:06,762
you will get all the spam and viruses. Right? Because it's end to end encrypted.

314
00:14:06,771 --> 00:14:07,721
You, you can't

315
00:14:07,822 --> 00:14:10,271
scan it for spam and viruses on the server

316
00:14:10,421 --> 00:14:13,182
and they go, oh, well, you know, whitelisting centers and stuff.

317
00:14:13,192 --> 00:14:15,851
And I'm like, yeah, that, that's fantastic for some people,

318
00:14:15,861 --> 00:14:17,552
but for most of us we do like

319
00:14:17,661 --> 00:14:18,952
to be reachable by,

320
00:14:19,062 --> 00:14:20,392
you know, other people,

321
00:14:20,502 --> 00:14:21,961
not just the people we know

322
00:14:22,171 --> 00:14:25,531
and all the spam I get now comes from gmail accounts,

323
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:27,752
they're either hacked or just

324
00:14:28,593 --> 00:14:29,304
accounts.

325
00:14:29,523 --> 00:14:34,033
And so the other challenge then is you want to do, end to end encryption. Cool.

326
00:14:34,044 --> 00:14:38,314
Now you get to do key management and if you lose that key you'll lose all your email.

327
00:14:38,323 --> 00:14:40,314
Oh, well, I didn't need that email anyway.

328
00:14:40,473 --> 00:14:43,393
And again they go, what do you mean? And I'm like, well, number one. Ok.

329
00:14:43,403 --> 00:14:46,994
So the, all your email can be backed up that, that part's easy. You know, the servers,

330
00:14:47,174 --> 00:14:50,614
you know, all that stuff's back up, that's relatively sane.

331
00:14:50,854 --> 00:14:53,934
But if it's end to end encrypted then

332
00:14:54,283 --> 00:14:55,193
and you really want to,

333
00:14:55,556 --> 00:14:59,135
that means only you get to have and control the keys. Oh, cool. That's what I want.

334
00:14:59,216 --> 00:15:01,815
Yeah. So that means you have to have

335
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,416
and control the keys.

336
00:15:03,806 --> 00:15:04,075
You know,

337
00:15:04,176 --> 00:15:06,676
because you Josh have that insane system with

338
00:15:06,685 --> 00:15:09,145
your ssh keys and safety deposit boxes and

339
00:15:09,346 --> 00:15:11,116
I believe physical tokens. And

340
00:15:11,325 --> 00:15:12,236
uh yeah.

341
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:12,666
Yeah.

342
00:15:12,676 --> 00:15:14,286
I don't, I don't really care anymore,

343
00:15:14,296 --> 00:15:18,116
but I did create a monstrosity of a process for myself.

344
00:15:18,135 --> 00:15:22,195
-- It's terrible. I agree.
-- Yes. And you never use it because it's such a pain. Right.

345
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,570
And this is,

346
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:29,219
this is just, uh, this conversation, man. It, it depresses me

347
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:31,969
every time we talk about this just because

348
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:33,549
I'm, I'm going to, I,

349
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:37,260
I wanna clarify something really important that always comes up and

350
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:42,919
these people will always make the argument of law enforcement needs to do their job

351
00:15:43,369 --> 00:15:46,799
and here law enforcement does do their job and they

352
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:49,890
don't necessarily need this ability to do their job.

353
00:15:50,229 --> 00:15:54,130
You could make the argument that certain things they do would be easier.

354
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,799
-- Well, it certainly makes it easier
-- and that could be,

355
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,200
it would also be easier if,

356
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:02,229
but it would also be easier if we had warrantless searches for everything.

357
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:06,969
Yes. Exactly. Or it would be easier if we all just were tracking devices 24 7.

358
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:10,000
-- Um,
-- well, we kind of do, don't, let's not go there. Yeah.

359
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:13,010
Sorry, I have some bad news for you.

360
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:16,049
We kind of do. We kind of do. But, I mean,

361
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,210
law enforcement's job

362
00:16:18,369 --> 00:16:20,729
is to investigate

363
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,770
crime.

364
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:23,320
Let's, let's, I mean,

365
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,739
I'm sure there's tons of edge cases and someone's yelling at the computer right now,

366
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,359
but that's fine.

367
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:30,409
But, I mean, fundamentally right, their job is to investigate.

368
00:16:30,469 --> 00:16:33,849
Well, actually it's a bit more, I think, I think the subtle part there is

369
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:38,400
there's investigating the crime sort of before something significant

370
00:16:38,409 --> 00:16:41,840
happens and investigating the crime after something significant happens.

371
00:16:41,849 --> 00:16:44,450
And obviously my understanding of most law enforcement people,

372
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:47,460
because they are by and large, generally decent human beings,

373
00:16:47,609 --> 00:16:49,919
they prefer to investigate the major crimes

374
00:16:50,025 --> 00:16:52,405
before they happen so that they don't end up happening.

375
00:16:52,655 --> 00:16:56,244
Which, yeah, I want that too to be clear. I also want this,

376
00:16:56,395 --> 00:16:57,885
but at the same time, I don't

377
00:16:58,104 --> 00:17:01,195
necessarily want to live in a police state. So it's that trade off.

378
00:17:01,205 --> 00:17:02,645
I want to be secure and safe.

379
00:17:02,994 --> 00:17:05,625
But I don't necessarily want, you know, to have a

380
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,824
government approved surveillance camera put in my house

381
00:17:07,834 --> 00:17:09,084
to make sure I'm not cooking meth.

382
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:11,685
Right. Exactly. That. And so

383
00:17:11,854 --> 00:17:15,525
law enforcement's inability to see encrypted messages

384
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,765
doesn't prevent them from doing their job.

385
00:17:18,045 --> 00:17:18,805
And I think

386
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,520
that gets lost sometimes because I feel

387
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:24,459
like this is a dishonest argument always where

388
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,199
the attorney general

389
00:17:26,358 --> 00:17:27,118
is.

390
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,400
I think being more honest than they've ever been in the past,

391
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,920
but his arguments are still not completely honest.

392
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:35,250
And unfortunately, the people

393
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:38,020
talking about this, like, I'll use us for an example.

394
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,359
Uh, we want to have a completely honest argument.

395
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:43,040
Our intent is not to deceive.

396
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:47,239
Whereas the attorney general there, there's kind of two places he's at.

397
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,099
He either doesn't understand the problem which is bad

398
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:54,479
or he understands it and he's purposely lying to us, which is even worse.

399
00:17:54,859 --> 00:17:57,349
II, I wouldn't say that he's purposely lying to us.

400
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:00,839
I fundamentally, he's a lawyer arguing a case.

401
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,280
And you know, what's that expression?

402
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:06,040
When, when you don't have the law, you argue the facts, when you don't have the facts,

403
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,040
you argue the law.

404
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:11,479
And so he's arguing the law because the facts are complicated in this case,

405
00:18:11,489 --> 00:18:12,020
I would say,

406
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:16,380
right? It, it's like these are very complicated tradeoffs because for one thing,

407
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,780
we don't have any data

408
00:18:17,969 --> 00:18:20,689
to really base it on like, like if we literally say

409
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:25,219
we back like let's take, I'll pick on signal because I like it and I use it a lot.

410
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:28,969
So let's let's assume signal for a moment actually puts in a like a call,

411
00:18:28,979 --> 00:18:30,780
a wiretap style backdoor.

412
00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:34,500
But you know, the FBI can come to them and say like uh you know,

413
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,119
this phone number because signals based on phone numbers.

414
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,020
So

415
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:41,290
yeah, like we want to tap this phone number every incoming outgoing

416
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,180
call as it were, you know, text

417
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:43,979
blah, blah, blah,

418
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:47,430
we want to get that stuff in real time just like we would with a phone switch, right?

419
00:18:47,479 --> 00:18:48,270
Seems reasonable.

420
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:51,060
How open to abuse would that actually be,

421
00:18:51,569 --> 00:18:52,479
you know, for example,

422
00:18:52,489 --> 00:18:55,949
do they just have anybody who says I'm from the FBI and they call 1

423
00:18:55,959 --> 00:19:01,189
800 number to request a wiretap or do they have some really onerous secure process

424
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:03,030
or something in the middle

425
00:19:03,449 --> 00:19:06,060
or? You know what I mean? The problem is

426
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:10,869
-- the devil's in the details
-- or what about other countries? What about a country

427
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:15,670
that says we want to spy on these dissidents and you say, well, I don't,

428
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,579
I don't think that's ok and they're like, but it, it's illegal here.

429
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,910
Let's pick on Kazakhstan.

430
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,819
The Kazakhstani government comes to you and says, uh yeah,

431
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,900
we want to wiretap everybody in Kazakhstan

432
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:26,579
actually.

433
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:31,380
Did you hear that they're undoing that they're not gonna roll out certificates?

434
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,369
Well, probably because they also realized it doesn't

435
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:38,119
really accomplish what they wanted to, but back to that. So, so

436
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:43,140
you could make a case that a government can say we want to wiretap all our people,

437
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:45,219
right? Because at least they have the legal

438
00:19:45,489 --> 00:19:48,880
authority over them. I'm not going to say they have the legal authority to do so.

439
00:19:49,209 --> 00:19:49,670
But

440
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:52,189
you know, at least those people live in that country and blah, blah, blah.

441
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,380
But what happens when Kazakhstan says, oh,

442
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:59,079
we suspect Kurtis committing some crime in Kazakhstan from Canada.

443
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:03,030
We want to wiretap his number does signal, say yes or no.

444
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:05,180
What about when Kazakhstan says,

445
00:20:05,469 --> 00:20:07,619
uh we just want to wiretap everybody in Canada

446
00:20:08,219 --> 00:20:08,819
to signal,

447
00:20:09,219 --> 00:20:12,140
right? It's a lawful request. It's gone through the Kazakhstan,

448
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:14,430
you know, legal process for the sake of argument.

449
00:20:14,439 --> 00:20:15,979
The Supreme Court has said yes to it.

450
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,640
What does signal do? It's a lawful request

451
00:20:19,099 --> 00:20:23,790
from a country, a legitimate government like, and when I say legitimate, I mean,

452
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,229
that's the government that's in power,

453
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,280
you know how they got there. That's another question.

454
00:20:28,569 --> 00:20:32,920
Well, in the internet is an amorphous place. The internet isn't

455
00:20:33,689 --> 00:20:37,699
-- kind of a physical location.
-- One could say it's the fifth domain,

456
00:20:37,709 --> 00:20:38,579
the fifth domain.

457
00:20:38,589 --> 00:20:39,189
That's right.

458
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:42,489
And when we look at the context of

459
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:45,099
wiretapping a telephone network,

460
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,270
you go to a building

461
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,989
in your jurisdiction

462
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,989
and the person on the other end of

463
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,939
the building is almost certainly in your jurisdiction.

464
00:20:53,949 --> 00:20:56,790
And you can say this is the data I want

465
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,510
from this person who is here

466
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:00,630
where

467
00:21:00,949 --> 00:21:04,949
you just traveled to the United States and use signal from there.

468
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,869
What is your jurisdiction?

469
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:07,270
Right?

470
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,270
Does Canada have any say over what you do while

471
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,489
you're in the United States using a encrypted messenger?

472
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,430
Well, funnily enough, actually, uh US law,

473
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,219
now there's cases where essentially people breaking us law while they're

474
00:21:20,229 --> 00:21:23,130
not in the US have been found guilty of breaking.

475
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:23,750
So they're,

476
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,989
they're breaking what is against the law in the US

477
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,130
but not against the law in the country they're in.

478
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,969
Well, the, the US did that against a bunch of Russian hackers.

479
00:21:31,979 --> 00:21:35,699
And now if these people ever enter the United States, they will be arrested.

480
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,420
Yeah. Like so like the Russian hackers.

481
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,630
Yeah, the Russian hackers did something that is,

482
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,500
well, at least you could say there they did something

483
00:21:42,689 --> 00:21:46,390
you can argue where it happened but it's sort of quasi happened in the US.

484
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,130
But I'm talking in the case where you do something.

485
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,790
Like, for example, you Jaywalk in Germany,

486
00:21:51,369 --> 00:21:54,630
I don't know if it's legal or not, but let's assume it's legal in Germany to Jaywalk

487
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:59,160
and then you come back to America and you get charged with Jaywalking in Germany.

488
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:02,790
-- You know, because they have security footage of it.
-- That sounds ridiculous.

489
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:07,170
There are some laws being enforced like that in the US and other countries now where,

490
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:07,550
you know,

491
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,040
you do something that's not illegal in a

492
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,829
foreign country but it's illegal in the US like

493
00:22:11,025 --> 00:22:16,895
that whole, uh, what is it? The foreign corruption, bribery practices act thing.

494
00:22:16,905 --> 00:22:17,055
Um,

495
00:22:17,234 --> 00:22:19,574
-- what's it called in the
-- US? Uh, yeah, I know what you mean,

496
00:22:19,694 --> 00:22:23,255
where it's illegal to bribe foreign officials when you're in their country,

497
00:22:23,285 --> 00:22:26,494
if you're a company doing business in the United States.

498
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:27,015
Yeah.

499
00:22:27,025 --> 00:22:29,464
And my understanding is even if, uh, because, you know,

500
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:30,854
I've had to take training on this.

501
00:22:30,864 --> 00:22:33,285
It's a US company and even if I'm not

502
00:22:33,614 --> 00:22:38,045
in the US, I'm not a US citizen, I don't work directly for the US company

503
00:22:38,474 --> 00:22:40,564
as a subsidiary or whatever of it.

504
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,930
Yeah. They, they, they don't care. Right. Right.

505
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,130
Well, or a great example.

506
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:49,459
I remember when we were getting the, the stock, the insider stock trading, uh,

507
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:50,410
lecture.

508
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:53,510
And I was like, I'm a Canadian. They're like, it applies to you. Right.

509
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,900
Like, that's it. Right. Like, tough, you know, it's the SEC.

510
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,300
They don't care that I'm in Canada.

511
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,170
Right. Right.

512
00:22:58,329 --> 00:22:58,790
And, I mean,

513
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:03,329
you're kind of a bad example because you traveled to the US on a regular basis.

514
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:05,930
Whereas it's when, when you and

515
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:11,750
all right, so let's, let's reel ourselves back in and get back to the topic at hand of

516
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,439
encryption, backdoors for use by law enforcement.

517
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,280
Well,

518
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:20,359
I guess the question is how do we make security trade offs when we don't have data

519
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,770
to assess the risk?

520
00:23:21,989 --> 00:23:24,709
Like, what is the actual, uh, remember from back in the day?

521
00:23:24,719 --> 00:23:29,250
What is it, the annualized loss expectancy? Right. It was that old formula of like,

522
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:29,630
you know,

523
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,400
a cyber attack cost a million dollars and it's like a one in a million chance a year.

524
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:36,030
So the A le for that is a dollar to be clear.

525
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,989
That kind of math doesn't really work in the real world very well.

526
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,530
Um, but it's simple. So people like it, that's the thing.

527
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:44,969
What is the A le like of signal, having a back door?

528
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,689
It, it's enormous.

529
00:23:46,699 --> 00:23:50,589
I mean, in the, in, in the context of signal, it would destroy them. And

530
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:55,010
the thing that always eats me about all this though is, let's say

531
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:58,469
that the US government passes some laws and

532
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:02,250
they force Facebook and Google and whoever else to

533
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:05,449
put these encryption backdoors into the products.

534
00:24:06,229 --> 00:24:10,900
Only the dumbest criminals are going to use these and in reality,

535
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:13,699
you're going to catch those people anyway because they

536
00:24:13,709 --> 00:24:16,479
would be making so many other ridiculous mistakes.

537
00:24:16,609 --> 00:24:18,500
I mean, that's the honest truth of it.

538
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,790
Well, and the really brutal truth is, you know,

539
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,859
-- honestly I care more about the metadata and that's
-- fair to them.

540
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:25,869
-- There's so much in
-- metadata, right?

541
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,579
The metadata who's talking to who and how are they talking to each other?

542
00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:33,420
-- Well, that's also a heck of a lot easier to parse
-- it is. And they already have that.

543
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:34,089
Yeah.

544
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,439
Well, you have to have that if you want to write your calls. Right. Right.

545
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,270
You know, and that's, and that's another brutal truth of end to end encryption,

546
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:40,459
right?

547
00:24:40,469 --> 00:24:42,910
Everybody's like, oh, end to end encryption all privacy. And I'm like,

548
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,160
not so much.

549
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:44,780
Right. I mean,

550
00:24:44,939 --> 00:24:45,469
let's face it.

551
00:24:45,479 --> 00:24:50,430
If, if I call you every day for a month and then I commit some heinous crime,

552
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,280
they're going to come talk to you even though they

553
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,420
have no idea what I was talking to you about.

554
00:24:54,439 --> 00:24:56,900
And they're going to say, what were you talking to Josh about?

555
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,060
And then

556
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,150
you'll probably cave briefly and tell them, you know, we,

557
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,819
we were discussing cookie recipes.

558
00:25:02,859 --> 00:25:03,010
-- Oh,
-- I

559
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,069
-- will
-- sell you out for a

560
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:07,040
sandwich sandwich. You buy is higher than mine.

561
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:08,829
I

562
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,780
mean, yeah, it's, uh,

563
00:25:11,589 --> 00:25:12,869
so I, I guess,

564
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:16,880
and see the problem is lawyers, generally speaking,

565
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,630
are good at making arguments because that, that is literally their job.

566
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,410
Uh, yes, it is.

567
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:23,890
And I mean,

568
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,640
as much as you may like or dislike the current attorney general,

569
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:30,520
the fact is he's at least reasonably competent as a lawyer,

570
00:25:30,849 --> 00:25:31,969
probably.

571
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,410
I believe he's a lawyer actually.

572
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,689
I, do you have to be a lawyer to be the attorney general.

573
00:25:35,699 --> 00:25:37,709
I don't know the answer to that actually. No,

574
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,000
-- no, I think
-- they are all lawyers

575
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:40,660
but

576
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:43,479
I, I can't imagine one who is, well, here's the thing.

577
00:25:43,489 --> 00:25:46,300
The reality is having a non lawyer in that position

578
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,270
seems like it would be a bit of a problem.

579
00:25:48,329 --> 00:25:50,099
It would be ridiculous. Yes.

580
00:25:50,109 --> 00:25:52,640
They would have to have the training to understand all that stuff and

581
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:55,469
the training to understand all that stuff is called being a lawyer.

582
00:25:55,479 --> 00:25:56,050
Exactly.

583
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:56,609
I always,

584
00:25:56,619 --> 00:25:59,280
I always love talking to the lawyers because it's like here's how

585
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:01,760
you don't sound like an idiot and get us in trouble.

586
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:04,479
And then when, when someone tells you it sounds really obvious,

587
00:26:04,489 --> 00:26:06,760
but at the same time there's that kind of basic

588
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,839
knowledge you need to get there in the first place.

589
00:26:08,849 --> 00:26:10,800
No, it's, it's wild man. Definitely.

590
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,770
So, I,

591
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:17,449
I feel like we haven't answered any of the questions around encrypted backdoors and

592
00:26:17,859 --> 00:26:18,790
I guess

593
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:19,670
I

594
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,030
-- don't think we ever will.
-- We probably won't

595
00:26:22,329 --> 00:26:24,560
even with data, we still have the tradeoffs. Like

596
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,160
even with data, different people have

597
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:32,400
different values on that data. So for example, dissidents versus companies versus

598
00:26:32,619 --> 00:26:36,750
-- anti-government protesters,
-- I want to back up for a minute and,

599
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,630
and you're talking about trade offs and I think,

600
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:44,319
I don't think the tradeoffs are ever going to be worth it

601
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:47,060
in the context of encrypted

602
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:48,079
anything

603
00:26:48,369 --> 00:26:50,170
on the internet because

604
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,800
without encryption,

605
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,819
the internet could not function the way it does today.

606
00:26:54,829 --> 00:26:56,839
And if we don't trust that encryption,

607
00:26:57,109 --> 00:27:02,319
we have a problem. And I think as soon as you give any sort of government

608
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,119
a little bit of a foothold in this space,

609
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:10,260
they're going to take a mile, they're not going to be happy with one little thing.

610
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:13,760
What I really don't understand is that something like email, for example,

611
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,520
is generally not end to end encrypted.

612
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:18,380
And it's not my understanding is if anybody serves Google

613
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:21,500
with a subpoena or a warrant for my email data,

614
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,760
they can just hand it over.

615
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,260
I would expect them to.

616
00:27:24,369 --> 00:27:26,060
-- Right.
-- Technically speaking. Yeah.

617
00:27:26,349 --> 00:27:29,209
And so like it's encrypted in transit, it's encrypted at rest,

618
00:27:29,219 --> 00:27:31,339
but it's encrypted at rest by Google.

619
00:27:31,869 --> 00:27:34,849
And so my understanding, like as far as I know, they don't like

620
00:27:34,949 --> 00:27:38,030
use my password to as part of the encryption key or something, you know,

621
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,599
like say um like, what was it?

622
00:27:39,609 --> 00:27:41,719
Uh Mega did you know with Mega,

623
00:27:41,729 --> 00:27:43,510
the idea was they stored your files and the

624
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,390
encryption keys to store your files with your password.

625
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,089
So if you lost your password, too bad, so sad, your files are gone.

626
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:49,449
And on the flip side mega is like,

627
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:51,609
officially we don't know what's in there.

628
00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:53,729
Exactly. And so

629
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:59,250
what I find so weird is that things like email and phone calls

630
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:03,579
all have that they're all accessible with a warrant or a subpoena.

631
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:07,130
And so what I really worry about is, is part of the push for this is

632
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,420
a push

633
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:13,300
to get around warrants and subpoenas and, and due process because,

634
00:28:13,579 --> 00:28:14,819
you know, from what I've read

635
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:21,449
-- due process is good. I like it.
-- It, it is the cornerstone of our society.

636
00:28:21,609 --> 00:28:23,020
-- Yeah. Yeah,
-- exactly.

637
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,599
I don't think they're trying to circumvent due process, but at the same time,

638
00:28:26,609 --> 00:28:30,199
there have been a lot of sort of creeping

639
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:34,339
changes where certain parts of due process are have,

640
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,729
well, there was a case here in Canada where, you know,

641
00:28:36,739 --> 00:28:39,900
these parking companies were given access to the license plate database.

642
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,810
The argument being that if we don't have access to that license plate database,

643
00:28:43,819 --> 00:28:44,660
we can't give them a tip,

644
00:28:44,753 --> 00:28:48,223
we have to tow their car and that's expensive and it's people hate us

645
00:28:48,383 --> 00:28:49,133
and blah, blah, blah.

646
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:50,802
And part of it is the,

647
00:28:50,912 --> 00:28:53,953
you know, the privacy commissioner. My understanding is the privacy commissioner

648
00:28:54,093 --> 00:28:56,093
and everything kind of went well, yeah, too bad.

649
00:28:56,103 --> 00:28:59,093
Like you don't get to just have access to these police databases because

650
00:28:59,463 --> 00:29:02,042
it's convenient to you. Like we have privacy laws.

651
00:29:02,052 --> 00:29:05,172
I bet that would not happen like that in the United States.

652
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:06,993
Ok. So,

653
00:29:07,113 --> 00:29:07,932
I guess let's,

654
00:29:07,942 --> 00:29:12,762
let's call this one where we're basically out of time and I guess fundamentally

655
00:29:12,963 --> 00:29:16,005
the thing to do for everyone listening is

656
00:29:16,015 --> 00:29:18,286
make sure you pay attention to these issues,

657
00:29:18,296 --> 00:29:21,926
make sure you're writing letters to the people who you can write letters to,

658
00:29:21,936 --> 00:29:23,566
to affect some of this change.

659
00:29:23,576 --> 00:29:27,046
And this is one of those fights that I don't think will ever go away.

660
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:30,786
I think we will all be dead long before this fight is.

661
00:29:30,796 --> 00:29:34,745
And it's up to all of us to make sure that these people don't win.

662
00:29:34,975 --> 00:29:38,526
And it's not that I think they're like, I'm not going to argue they're bad people,

663
00:29:38,536 --> 00:29:40,436
but I do think they're misguided and I

664
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:42,605
don't think they completely understand what's happening.

665
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:43,995
And so it's up to us

666
00:29:44,329 --> 00:29:48,949
to basically be like the watchman of the internet and make sure this never happens.

667
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:50,270
My thought would be,

668
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:52,719
even if we don't have data on the tradeoffs,

669
00:29:52,729 --> 00:29:56,560
we can at least identify what the tradeoffs and potential consequences are.

670
00:29:56,569 --> 00:30:00,390
And I think we should do that and make them aware of it because like you said, II,

671
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,390
I honestly think some of it might not be

672
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,219
because it's really subtle when you start talking about,

673
00:30:05,479 --> 00:30:06,359
you know, back door,

674
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,150
something like there's a world of difference

675
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,209
between backdoor signal and how you would

676
00:30:10,219 --> 00:30:12,609
do that and back door slack and how you do that and back door

677
00:30:13,329 --> 00:30:15,219
Irc servers and how you would do that. And,

678
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:18,439
and these are some really complicated, subtle technical differences.

679
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:21,430

680
00:30:21,449 --> 00:30:23,680

681
00:30:23,969 --> 00:30:25,449
see, I think one of the biggest problems was,

682
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:29,300
-- I, I suspect these two sides aren't arguing about the same thing and
-- I,

683
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,520
I don't think they are and that's probably

684
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,050
conversation for another day.

685
00:30:33,219 --> 00:30:36,989
