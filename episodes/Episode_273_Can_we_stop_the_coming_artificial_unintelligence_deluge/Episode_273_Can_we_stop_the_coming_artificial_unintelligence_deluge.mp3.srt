Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt Siefried

1
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,949
and my partner in commentary, Josh Bresser

2
00:00:12,109 --> 00:00:15,210
-- commentary. I thought it was Thought Crime. Well, I
-- thought

3
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:15,619
-- that
-- was the

4
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:17,440
-- today's theme. Is
-- it?

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,739
I guess it is commentary. It, it's a number of comment related topics

6
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:28,510
-- that we want to discuss. Let's set the stage, shall we?
-- So several?

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,900
I actually just, I'm looking it up. When was the whole FCC comment

8
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:35,639
controversy?

9
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,860
It's always been going on.

10
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:43,139
So there is an article from Schneier that we will put in the show notes,

11
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:47,520
basically pointing out the fact that in one of the recent FCC.

12
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:51,569
-- So it was 2017.
-- Was it 27? That's pretty recent. It was like

13
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,540
a decade ago,

14
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,599
-- a decade
-- ago,

15
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,369
years.

16
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,069
Oh, in COVID years, that's fair.

17
00:00:57,139 --> 00:01:00,979
But basically what happened was anytime I shouldn't say any time,

18
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:05,209
but it is quite normal in the FCC world and in a lot of the government in

19
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,879
general where they will have like public comments

20
00:01:07,889 --> 00:01:11,430
where people can voice their opposition or agreement,

21
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,190
stakeholders can voice there.

22
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:14,889
You got to remember stakeholders,

23
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,000
whatever humans are stakeholders in most of these.

24
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,050
-- No
-- Well, no, you're thinking of corporations,

25
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:24,430
well, corporations ultimately get to make the decisions.

26
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:28,779
But basically the idea is that comments come from humans

27
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:33,449
and then the FCC can weigh those comments one way or the other

28
00:01:33,699 --> 00:01:34,449
and then

29
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:39,309
decide, well, take that into account where obviously the intent being,

30
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:42,160
if there's a lot of we'll say comments for or

31
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:45,019
-- against that could help sway the decision making
-- well,

32
00:01:45,029 --> 00:01:49,019
or people bringing up a topic or an issue that wasn't thought to be as bad as it is or.

33
00:01:49,029 --> 00:01:51,305
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's fair. You know, like a lot of people, I,

34
00:01:51,514 --> 00:01:52,555
for example,

35
00:01:52,565 --> 00:01:57,144
I think a lot of people misunderstand how completely crap rural broadband is.

36
00:01:57,514 --> 00:01:59,944
And I know a lot of people who live early and have, you know,

37
00:01:59,955 --> 00:02:02,504
those long range wi Fi connections and for example,

38
00:02:02,514 --> 00:02:04,904
they can't do more than one video call at a time

39
00:02:04,915 --> 00:02:07,775
or more than one sort of major activity at a time

40
00:02:07,985 --> 00:02:09,854
because the jitter is so bad,

41
00:02:10,235 --> 00:02:13,014
you're sure they're getting, you know, 10 or 20 megabits per second download.

42
00:02:13,024 --> 00:02:16,304
But the minute they start uploading or, you know, using it heavily, it,

43
00:02:16,315 --> 00:02:17,985
it basically falls apart,

44
00:02:19,059 --> 00:02:19,419
you know.

45
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:21,690
And so a lot of people like, oh, but, or, you know,

46
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:23,080
they have satellite internet and it's like you,

47
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:26,199
you can't video over a half second delay

48
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,279
and in some cases, you know,

49
00:02:28,429 --> 00:02:31,539
people have been posting their stats and it's multiple seconds. So

50
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,710
I think comments are really valuable in a, in some cases where,

51
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:41,050
oh, no, it actually like 80% of people have this problem.

52
00:02:41,059 --> 00:02:44,240
It's not just once in a while, it's actually the majority, you know,

53
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,000
or even it's just maybe 10% but still 10% is a lot.

54
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:50,199
-- That's right. That's right. And that's where a lot of this comes in.
-- Right. Right.

55
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,289
And so what, what Schneier's story covers

56
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,404
is basically there are groups

57
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:59,054
that have used A I

58
00:02:59,285 --> 00:03:02,574
to we'll say mask that these comments

59
00:03:02,914 --> 00:03:04,455
are all coming from one place.

60
00:03:04,634 --> 00:03:06,384
It's more one layer of abstraction.

61
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:06,604
These,

62
00:03:06,615 --> 00:03:12,654
these groups use services and in past the services used people and bad scripts

63
00:03:12,884 --> 00:03:15,005
and now they use increasingly

64
00:03:15,164 --> 00:03:16,205
better tools

65
00:03:17,059 --> 00:03:20,990
that look, you know, and appear more human and allow the few humans,

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,720
they do have to do a better job because this stuff is a service.

67
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:24,559
This is a business.

68
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:27,809
Yeah, absolutely. Which is terrifying. But

69
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,990
I mean, so the reason this matters is historically,

70
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,160
when we'll say you've had these like comment mills,

71
00:03:35,309 --> 00:03:38,970
it has been trivial to figure out where it's coming from.

72
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,210
-- Well, to separate the wheat from the chaff. Right.
-- Right.

73
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,740
One of my favorite examples is the FCC allows

74
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,160
the public to complain about things on the airwaves

75
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,619
and something like 90% of the complaints come from like six groups

76
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,656
and they know this because it's basically just form letters,

77
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,136
people are mailing it to the FCC.

78
00:03:58,145 --> 00:04:00,955
So they have the ability to pretty trivially be like, yeah, whatever,

79
00:04:00,966 --> 00:04:02,136
put it in the pile.

80
00:04:02,145 --> 00:04:03,335
And of course,

81
00:04:03,345 --> 00:04:05,725
when it's six groups complaining that has less weight

82
00:04:05,735 --> 00:04:09,345
when it's say 6000 or 60,000 groups complaining.

83
00:04:09,436 --> 00:04:10,856
But now because of this

84
00:04:11,106 --> 00:04:13,255
A I that has the ability to, you know,

85
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:15,686
basically make subtle changes to the message in a

86
00:04:15,695 --> 00:04:18,415
way that looks like it's coming from multiple people.

87
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,935
Now, the game is completely different.

88
00:04:20,946 --> 00:04:23,075
Well, it's not even, it's more that they're completely,

89
00:04:23,085 --> 00:04:24,805
they're generating completely

90
00:04:24,992 --> 00:04:29,962
unique in different messages and different viewpoints or different topics.

91
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:32,212
The Ac Lu did a Reddit A ma

92
00:04:32,492 --> 00:04:32,502
Oh,

93
00:04:32,682 --> 00:04:33,221
my goodness. Yes.

94
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:36,622
And it got obviously brigade because

95
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:39,481
the questions basically boil down to.

96
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:41,582
So the Ac Lu used to be a good organization

97
00:04:41,592 --> 00:04:43,761
but now that you're killing puppies all the time.

98
00:04:43,802 --> 00:04:44,791
Yeah, exactly.

99
00:04:44,821 --> 00:04:46,851
Can you please explain how much of your

100
00:04:46,861 --> 00:04:49,532
budget is going to buying methamphetamines and,

101
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,492
you know, assault rifles with which to blah, blah, blah.

102
00:04:52,502 --> 00:04:54,812
Right. It's just the comments you read them

103
00:04:55,369 --> 00:04:56,029
and it's

104
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,299
obviously

105
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,679
they're, they're inflammatory at, at, at

106
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:02,980
-- best. Yeah,
-- absolutely.

107
00:05:02,989 --> 00:05:06,589
-- And, and there will obviously be a link to this in the show notes
-- and they're,

108
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,859
they're voted up like it got

109
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,700
Brided. That's true. Right. There's,

110
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:15,019
there's obviously some sort of, we'll say large scale

111
00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:18,829
effort going on here in terms of what happened on Reddit and

112
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:19,890
it's,

113
00:05:20,609 --> 00:05:22,869
it's frustrating as a human

114
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,109
to look at stuff like this because obviously we want to think that

115
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:30,570
like social media works and the comments the government asked for works and

116
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,459
if the AC lu does an A ma that they're going

117
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,869
to get reasonable questions and not get barraged by trolls.

118
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,209
Well, and even worse than trolls organized trolls,

119
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,570
trolls with a strong agenda to discredit the AC lu for example, in this case.

120
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:45,630
-- Right. Right.
-- And do long term harm.

121
00:05:46,489 --> 00:05:49,980
I mean, in, in their particular instance, I'm hopeful they went so far.

122
00:05:49,989 --> 00:05:52,869
Anyone with any sense will look at it and be like, holy cow.

123
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,309
This is clearly not some people angry with the ac lu, but I mean, it won't,

124
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,070
it won't work for everyone, of course, but it this,

125
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:02,755
I keep turning this over in my mind and thinking

126
00:06:02,765 --> 00:06:06,015
about it and it's like with all this public,

127
00:06:06,024 --> 00:06:08,084
everything we see right now and like I let,

128
00:06:08,095 --> 00:06:11,005
let's use open source as our example just because it's,

129
00:06:11,015 --> 00:06:15,255
it's one of those things I love to think about what would stop a we'll say,

130
00:06:15,265 --> 00:06:17,084
motivated adversary

131
00:06:17,195 --> 00:06:18,045
from

132
00:06:18,424 --> 00:06:23,484
mounting a similar attack against an open source community like Freno maybe,

133
00:06:23,494 --> 00:06:23,725
right.

134
00:06:23,734 --> 00:06:24,864
Like, but you know what I mean?

135
00:06:24,975 --> 00:06:27,125
-- Well,
-- so that's an interesting thing. So

136
00:06:27,869 --> 00:06:32,149
there are sort of two separate issues here. One, you have sort of the content issue

137
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:36,290
and number two, did a human being actually generate this?

138
00:06:36,299 --> 00:06:36,630
Now,

139
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,089
the problem with this stuff is that it's high value enough in that you

140
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,970
can have somebody jump through any capcha

141
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,720
hoops or whatever So the question becomes,

142
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:48,410
how do you strongly prove that a comment was written by a human and not, for example,

143
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:52,799
copy and pasted by a human working in a troll factory from an A I

144
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:54,130
system and you can't.

145
00:06:54,299 --> 00:06:58,649
Well, I want to head off one thing right now before we move on is

146
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:02,260
if you look at any of the comments in any of this stuff, you get a lot of, oh,

147
00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:05,630
-- but if we all had a digital ID that would solve all of the problems,
-- no,

148
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,320
it wouldn't because they'd still be cutting and pasting the

149
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:09,839
comments generated by the A I to be more efficient.

150
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,720
And that's see, that's,

151
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:17,799
-- but
-- there's also the angle of trying to assign every human like a unique digital ID

152
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,049
is

153
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,200
fraught with complications and unforeseen problems.

154
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:26,260
And so I would never condone this as

155
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:31,279
-- a long term solution for the planet
-- more to the 0.1 that

156
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,769
is accessible enough for other people to make use of it.

157
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:34,920
Right?

158
00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:37,019
And that's where it goes into Blockchain, digital, you know,

159
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:38,269
sovereign identity and all that.

160
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,410
But we'll leave that for another day.

161
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,029
Flaming tire fire.

162
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,019
Yes.

163
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,559
But you don't actually see here's the problem.

164
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,839
Even if you did have super strong digital ID mapping,

165
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:51,410
they would just hire people and for a penny to cut and paste,

166
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:51,799
right?

167
00:07:51,809 --> 00:07:53,359
And that's the problem is a lot of this

168
00:07:53,369 --> 00:07:57,040
stuff is valuable enough for the bad guys to spend

169
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:00,920
thousands or tens of thousands of dollars on what is effectively lobbying.

170
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,619
Um, like a great example is, you know,

171
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,600
the thought experiment who benefits from weakening or hurting the AC Lu.

172
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,420
Well, there's a lot of organizations, the AC Lu has sued a lot of governments,

173
00:08:12,429 --> 00:08:12,980
for example.

174
00:08:12,989 --> 00:08:17,130
Well, ok, they're not going to probably do this but a lot of, more by definition,

175
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,529
you know, these private entities that they've sued are

176
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,040
-- by many definitions. Generally not very nice.
-- Right. Right. Absolutely.

177
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:29,559
And they would happily spend 10 grand to hurt the C the AC Lu or the eff or whatever

178
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:33,289
these rights organizations are often held up as boogeymen by

179
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:37,133
other groups of like these groups are the problem,

180
00:08:37,164 --> 00:08:37,424
right?

181
00:08:37,462 --> 00:08:42,674
And so if you can say, oh, my group spent $45,000 to make the AC lu look bad.

182
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:45,453
-- That's a feather in their hat,
-- the long and the short of it.

183
00:08:45,463 --> 00:08:47,723
Even if we do something like cloud Fflur had

184
00:08:47,734 --> 00:08:50,794
a good thing about using cryptographic attestation of personhood,

185
00:08:50,804 --> 00:08:51,073
using

186
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:52,283
keys. And it's like,

187
00:08:52,453 --> 00:08:54,804
ok, cool. You can actually map it to the specific

188
00:08:54,984 --> 00:08:56,294
key and that would kind of, you know,

189
00:08:56,304 --> 00:09:00,953
you could tie it an a persona or identity or whatever to a specific piece of

190
00:09:00,963 --> 00:09:05,013
hardware that is typically not shared or easy to share or should not be shared.

191
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:06,030
Cool.

192
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:06,380
But again,

193
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,520
you still have the problem with these people

194
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,890
cutting and pasting everything and being like,

195
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,609
you know, I am

196
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,479
every time I look at Twitter

197
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:13,859
and the the replies, you know,

198
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:18,299
there's some obvious trolls where they have like three replies, no followers,

199
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:19,299
no following.

200
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:23,250
There are all these bot accounts and then some are sometimes some are,

201
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,859
it's hard to tell like this doesn't look like a human

202
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:29,969
but it's, you know, goes back a couple of years, it has followers, it has followed,

203
00:09:29,979 --> 00:09:31,450
it has like a lot of comments,

204
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:33,630
but then you start to look at the comments and they're kind of, oh,

205
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,010
this is like machine generated, kind of just weirdness,

206
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,119
you know,

207
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,900
like I'm increasingly noticing just because I've been doing

208
00:09:40,909 --> 00:09:43,539
some Google searches and there's a bunch of unique

209
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:46,000
terms that are now showing up on these sort

210
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,880
of randomly generated web pages for seo spam.

211
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,500
I actually, I have an example of this is, I don't know if you got the mail,

212
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,820
but we recently got

213
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:57,780
a couple of males from seemingly different organizations basically saying, oh,

214
00:09:57,789 --> 00:10:01,049
we, we put your podcast on our like top podcast list for the year

215
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:02,059
and,

216
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:05,280
and I replied, I replied to them with like,

217
00:10:05,429 --> 00:10:07,539
OK, you put us on a list like

218
00:10:07,979 --> 00:10:11,210
you, I can't find like there's no social media, there's like nothing here.

219
00:10:11,219 --> 00:10:11,739
Like I want

220
00:10:11,849 --> 00:10:13,340
want more, like show me more

221
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:16,929
and there's been no replies and they emailed me multiple times and I'm like,

222
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,200
this is clearly some sort of like link farming bot

223
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,719
organization and they're looking for back links to them I'm not,

224
00:10:22,729 --> 00:10:23,909
I'm not playing this game

225
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,729
but like you look at the website and it looks like a real news site.

226
00:10:27,739 --> 00:10:30,309
It's clear someone put some effort into this and

227
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,179
at the same time it's like there's something wrong,

228
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:36,609
you can put some effort into a bot that then generates all the content.

229
00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:37,780
But as a human being,

230
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:40,739
I can't tell the difference between bot generated content and real human content.

231
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,090
I mean,

232
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,909
aren't something like almost all the baseball stories

233
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,309
in America now written by a bot.

234
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,070
-- I know some of them are
-- right.

235
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,590
I don't follow baseball,

236
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:55,500
but I know a lot of earnings stories are now bot written where they feed like the

237
00:10:55,794 --> 00:10:59,823
support into the bat and it spits out just it's a lame story.

238
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,263
But obviously if you're being first is probably

239
00:11:02,273 --> 00:11:04,783
better than being right in that instance.

240
00:11:04,854 --> 00:11:08,304
Well, and is there any, I mean, this, this is an earnings, it's like a baseball game.

241
00:11:08,314 --> 00:11:12,643
There's really kind of only so much that happens short of a UFO landing on the field.

242
00:11:12,653 --> 00:11:14,703
One baseball game is much like the other is,

243
00:11:14,713 --> 00:11:16,903
and I know real baseball fans are gonna like

244
00:11:16,914 --> 00:11:18,963
wanna burn me at the stake for saying this.

245
00:11:18,973 --> 00:11:20,504
But my understanding of baseball is

246
00:11:20,607 --> 00:11:23,668
outside of some corner cases, it's a baseball game is a baseball game.

247
00:11:23,677 --> 00:11:26,028
-- Sorry guys,
-- they can be amusing.

248
00:11:26,038 --> 00:11:28,148
-- Well, yeah,
-- but I mean, there's, there's not going to,

249
00:11:28,158 --> 00:11:32,607
it's not going to be like a political event where it can go completely sideways.

250
00:11:32,617 --> 00:11:35,747
It, I mean, it's, let's say it's rare.

251
00:11:35,757 --> 00:11:40,257
There are instances where there's some excitement at the end of the game.

252
00:11:40,268 --> 00:11:43,937
-- But generally speaking, I would say it's not, it's
-- structured and it's, there's,

253
00:11:43,947 --> 00:11:45,427
there's really only a couple of vote,

254
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:46,361
there's generally about

255
00:11:46,521 --> 00:11:50,052
a couple of widely accepted outcomes and you can account for those in your bo

256
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:51,711
same thing with an earnings report.

257
00:11:51,721 --> 00:11:54,471
So that's the thing that gets me about all this is so we

258
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:57,392
can forcibly map comments and force them to be from a human.

259
00:11:57,401 --> 00:12:00,081
And let's even say we managed to dial it down to an individual human.

260
00:12:00,091 --> 00:12:00,622
So that, you know,

261
00:12:00,632 --> 00:12:04,411
somebody can't submit 50,000 comments as being from 50,000 different people.

262
00:12:04,421 --> 00:12:06,012
But we'd actually know it was from one person.

263
00:12:06,072 --> 00:12:06,331
Well,

264
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:09,552
then we still have the problem where they hire dozens or hundreds of

265
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,195
people to appear as a authorities on the subject and you know,

266
00:12:12,205 --> 00:12:15,916
spam the bejesus out of whatever forum or commentary or whatever.

267
00:12:15,926 --> 00:12:20,916
So I I part of me thinks the answer here is maybe more transparency.

268
00:12:20,926 --> 00:12:22,856
I would not disagree with that because

269
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:24,926
we've already established in the finance industry.

270
00:12:24,935 --> 00:12:27,476
Generally speaking, if you write in the finance industry,

271
00:12:27,846 --> 00:12:31,745
you have to disclose any positions held in relation to that company.

272
00:12:31,966 --> 00:12:35,356
Right? I can't, I can't write articles that are pro company a

273
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:39,659
and I secretly hold, you know, a long positioning company or conversely I write,

274
00:12:39,669 --> 00:12:40,010
you know,

275
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:43,309
articles dissing company a and I'm shorting their stock because then

276
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,099
it becomes really obvious as to why I'm writing those articles.

277
00:12:46,109 --> 00:12:50,099
Now. I mean, in that context, let's say

278
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:52,619
I write a letter to the FCC

279
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,309
and I work for a media company. How can you,

280
00:12:56,419 --> 00:12:58,539
I feel like you should have to disclose who you work for.

281
00:12:58,549 --> 00:13:01,099
How do you, how do you enforce that as the problem?

282
00:13:01,109 --> 00:13:02,780
Well, you'd have to spot check these, I mean,

283
00:13:02,789 --> 00:13:05,140
and that becomes part of the challenge too is how do you, you know,

284
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,940
whenever there's a petition, for example,

285
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,179
and people write their name and address and phone number.

286
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,130
Well, you either check some of them or all of them to verify that, you know,

287
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,669
IP freely at 123456 Street actually exists or not

288
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,739
because if you're going to solicit public comment,

289
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,150
isn't it sort of also then incumbent on you to ensure that it's somewhat good?

290
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:24,330
It's clearly not.

291
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,929
Well, depending on the situation, there are, there are, you know,

292
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,409
regulated industries where they have to solicit com, you know, uh feedback.

293
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,010
So for example, here in Alberta, we have a thing, I,

294
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,469
I know a lot about this because my mother worked for the government.

295
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,880
But the environmental impact and assessment where essentially,

296
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,190
let's say you want to build something like a pulp mill or an oil refinery,

297
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:44,599
you have to solicit feedback from the community

298
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,359
in a structured way, meaning you hold public meetings

299
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,289
and basically the public gets to go up and Kvetch about things like,

300
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:54,030
whatever they get to ask questions and, you know, I remember one pulp mill it was,

301
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:56,710
they basically were like, oh, you know, yeah,

302
00:13:56,719 --> 00:13:58,559
there's going to a lot of logging trucks on this road

303
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,960
but it won't be a big deal because it's about,

304
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:02,690
you know, it's only one logging truck every, like, 30 minutes or whatever.

305
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,780
And I'm, like, whispering to my mom. I'm like, hang on a second.

306
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:06,780
Like, do they run logging trucks 24 7?

307
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:09,210
Because I don't think that's how logging trucks work. She's like, no, they don't.

308
00:14:09,219 --> 00:14:11,530
I'm like, so wait, if they're running for, like, 12 hours a day,

309
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:12,799
that's one every 15 minutes

310
00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:15,900
and these things are big and loud, she's like, yep. Yes, they are.

311
00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:17,200
You know.

312
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,059
And so, like, the company's not lying,

313
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:23,260
but they're misdirecting and a great example being

314
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,289
orphaned wells in Alberta right now,

315
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:28,650
we have this huge tens of thousands of orphaned

316
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,679
oil and gas wells that have been abandoned.

317
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:33,630
I read about this. It made the news around here.

318
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,239
-- Yeah,
-- it's going to be in probably long term.

319
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,229
It's probably going to be in the tens of

320
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:38,909
billions of dollars to clean up and remediate.

321
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:42,460
You know, the oil and gas industry has basically managed to kind of astroturf this,

322
00:14:42,469 --> 00:14:43,909
that it's not that big of a deal, but of course,

323
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:46,929
landowners are starting to speak up now and increasingly, it's like

324
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,940
they haven't been paid for the usage of this

325
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,659
and there's like bad smells,

326
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:54,559
there's noise complaints from like the motors and stuff.

327
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:57,369
There's health concerns, like hydrocarbons are not good to breathe in

328
00:14:57,549 --> 00:15:00,419
and, you know, groundwater pollution, things like that.

329
00:15:00,429 --> 00:15:02,900
A lot of these guys, you know, they have wells for water, right.

330
00:15:02,909 --> 00:15:03,849
They're out in the middle of nowhere.

331
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,599
So,

332
00:15:04,609 --> 00:15:07,140
but the oil and gas industry has basically managed to

333
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,539
kind of publicly kind of make this go away.

334
00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:11,729
Like people aren't really all that freaked out about it.

335
00:15:11,739 --> 00:15:13,849
Well, and now from what I read,

336
00:15:14,099 --> 00:15:18,739
there's a bunch of wells that are done because they became unprofitable.

337
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,820
And the companies were like, oh, well, we're bankrupt now.

338
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,304
-- Sorry that
-- well, no, no, no.

339
00:15:22,315 --> 00:15:23,765
What they do is they typically sell those

340
00:15:23,775 --> 00:15:26,065
wells to another entity that then declares bankruptcy.

341
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:27,604
Oh, I see. I see.

342
00:15:27,614 --> 00:15:32,744
It's not our, we, we sold it to, you know, Xyz Corp and Xyz Corp is gone tough. Uh

343
00:15:33,275 --> 00:15:35,135
I know, I know.

344
00:15:35,304 --> 00:15:38,304
And so that's, that's one of the challenge with all these things is

345
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:39,945
again, you know,

346
00:15:39,955 --> 00:15:42,974
is it 99% of land own with these wells on

347
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,224
their properties are concerned or is it only 1%?

348
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,590
We don't know.

349
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:49,969
The point is if we solicited these comments publicly, guess what would happen,

350
00:15:49,979 --> 00:15:50,280
right?

351
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:54,630
-- The people with money to kind of abuse this would do so.
-- Almost definitely.

352
00:15:54,679 --> 00:16:00,289
Ok, let's, let's reel ourselves back into talk about A I one comment

353
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:06,169
that I don't know and someone else might know and I can probably look this up later is

354
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,109
I do not know if the FCC asks

355
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,400
if I work for a media company

356
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,729
when I fill this stuff out.

357
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,359
But now at the same time,

358
00:16:14,369 --> 00:16:20,919
if a media company is paying another company to pay people to copy and paste A I,

359
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:22,909
they can probably click.

360
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:26,479
I don't work for a media company because they technically don't.

361
00:16:26,729 --> 00:16:28,599
Oh no, there's all sorts of ways around this.

362
00:16:28,609 --> 00:16:32,150
Basically, none of this matters because whatever barriers a roadblock they put up

363
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,229
there, there's an incentive to engineer around them,

364
00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:37,390
right? Just like GDPR. GDPR was like this.

365
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,609
Hail hailed as the solution to, you know, privacy and data, whatever.

366
00:16:41,619 --> 00:16:44,030
But wait a minute, why aren't Google and Facebook worried at all?

367
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:45,919
Oh, this is toothless, you know,

368
00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:48,260
and now we have cookie warnings that eat up two minutes of your day,

369
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,710
-- every day for the rest of your life
-- right now.

370
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:53,630
Now, here's one of the

371
00:16:54,250 --> 00:17:00,349
I think important aspects of especially like GDPR is, it is not perfect,

372
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:03,530
it has holes so big you can drive a truck through,

373
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:06,589
but it is the first step of a long journey.

374
00:17:06,969 --> 00:17:13,868
And so I think one of the one of the challenges we face as humans is we like to say, oh,

375
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,939
that didn't work,

376
00:17:15,239 --> 00:17:18,380
we should give up instead of saying that didn't work.

377
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:21,959
How do we slowly fix it to get to where we want to be.

378
00:17:21,969 --> 00:17:25,569
And like all these FCC comments are the same deal. It's like, oh A is can,

379
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:30,089
can astroturf FCC comments like it's all broken. It's like, no, it's not.

380
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:32,270
The comment stuff makes sense.

381
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,780
And the FCC soliciting comments from humans is a good idea.

382
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,739
But how do we, how do we turn the knob in a way

383
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:39,949
that makes it

384
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:44,939
useful again? Because it's clear that the bad guys have

385
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:48,310
surpassed our ability to figure out what they're doing.

386
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:51,420
And one simple example of this is the my understanding

387
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:54,540
now is the majority of politicians don't care about email,

388
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:54,729
right?

389
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:57,099
They get a million emails on an issue. They don't care,

390
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,890
they care about voice, phone calls and physical letters,

391
00:18:01,089 --> 00:18:01,290
right?

392
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,170
There's even, it's funny, there's one,

393
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:08,109
I think it's an ML A or a member of parliament to forget which locally that

394
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,479
refuses to do email and everybody's like, oh,

395
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,920
but how do their constituents contact this person, blah, blah.

396
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,680
And he's like, basically emails a cesspool. It's just,

397
00:18:15,949 --> 00:18:17,719
it's, it's always like just garbage.

398
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:20,329
You can contact me via and I'm pretty sure it's an

399
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:23,010
MP because you can physically mail your MP for free.

400
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,189
Like literally, you, you put their address on it and it goes there for free.

401
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:27,560
It's, it's, that's clever.

402
00:18:27,569 --> 00:18:28,250
It's, it's, well,

403
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,719
it's been written into law for since the beginning or you

404
00:18:30,729 --> 00:18:32,729
can phone the person and leave a voicemail or whatever,

405
00:18:32,739 --> 00:18:33,400
which

406
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,479
-- you know what that seems reasonable. So
-- I call my representatives a lot.

407
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:40,410
I'm highly opinionated as should surprise nobody.

408
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:44,430
I would say 80% of the time a human picks up and even when they don't,

409
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:50,420
they call me back and my voicemails will say are are clearly not on the will say

410
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:52,619
the side of the issue,

411
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:56,859
many of my representatives are known to be on and they still will call me back.

412
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:57,500
Yeah,

413
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:02,530
I always get like a response letter that's like we value your response and we blah,

414
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,060
blah, blah.

415
00:19:03,069 --> 00:19:06,550
-- And I live in a Yeah, I live in a writing but
-- the letters I won't,

416
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:10,640
the letters are always basically like f off and die. We don't care what you think.

417
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,459
But I would say the phone calls are a bit more pleasant

418
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:16,410
and receptive and then they probably hang up and be

419
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,800
like you won't believe the person I just talked to.

420
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,780
Pretty much part of me wonders maybe if the solution

421
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:25,760
is to require physical letters and phone calls because we've

422
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,270
seen online brigade is you get 100 people and even

423
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,790
100 people with no tooling and just mashing their keyboards

424
00:19:32,989 --> 00:19:34,150
can have an outsized

425
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,589
appearance

426
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,459
-- of hundreds of thousands of comments. Right.
-- Oh, definitely, definitely.

427
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,319
I mean, one of my favorites always

428
00:19:41,459 --> 00:19:42,520
is where

429
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:47,479
there will be some sort of we'll say Twitter thread or Reddit thread or Facebook,

430
00:19:47,489 --> 00:19:48,089
whatever

431
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:48,750
and

432
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,560
someone especially a politician says something

433
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,479
and then

434
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:55,829
they clearly meant to log out and log back in as, like, one of their al

435
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,599
counts.

436
00:19:56,859 --> 00:20:00,170
And then they're like, and it's so funny because it's like, ah,

437
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,069
you're just so dumb and

438
00:20:02,209 --> 00:20:03,560
I would guarantee

439
00:20:03,989 --> 00:20:08,920
an enormous number of people have multiple alt accounts. Like, I'm not going to lie.

440
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,199
Like, I've got two Reddit accounts.

441
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:14,239
One, like, is my nice reddit account and the other one is just, if I want to be a troll,

442
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,199
that's where it goes.

443
00:20:15,209 --> 00:20:15,949
You know, I just

444
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:19,520
said a long time ago, just not to spend any time or effort doing that.

445
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,560
I generally don't. But every now and then it's like

446
00:20:22,765 --> 00:20:25,224
I need to add a comment to this.

447
00:20:25,635 --> 00:20:26,415
I

448
00:20:26,604 --> 00:20:30,064
agree because there are also people in a lot of situations who need privacy.

449
00:20:30,074 --> 00:20:32,564
You know, for example, somebody has a crazy abusive stalker.

450
00:20:32,574 --> 00:20:36,395
Should they be allowed to go online and use a pseudonym? Absolutely.

451
00:20:36,405 --> 00:20:38,665
More to the point. You know, people have nicknames in real life.

452
00:20:38,675 --> 00:20:41,405
Like we've like, I literally worked for,

453
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,329
nobody explained to me, Richard and Dick. I didn't know about that. So I was,

454
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:49,939
I was on site, you know, under the foreman, Richard who I knew was Richard

455
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:52,930
and somebody came into the office and said, where's Dick? And I'm like, I don't know.

456
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,569
And so for like three days,

457
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:57,849
all these electricians basically thought I was a complete moron because

458
00:20:57,859 --> 00:21:00,180
he's sitting like 10 ft behind me in a you know,

459
00:21:00,189 --> 00:21:01,750
in a little off other space.

460
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,810
And then finally

461
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:06,500
somebody was like, hey, Dick and Richard was like, yeah, what do you want?

462
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,119
I'm like, wait, is your name Richard or Dick?

463
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,619
And he's like, no, my name is Richard but you know,

464
00:21:09,739 --> 00:21:11,339
everybody calls me Dick. And I'm like,

465
00:21:11,869 --> 00:21:12,579
why,

466
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:16,530
why is that your nickname? He's like, no, that's, it's like William and Bill,

467
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,329
what's

468
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,170
how, what John and Jack

469
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:22,439
were two that went together as well?

470
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:24,650
See, this is, this hurts my brain

471
00:21:24,869 --> 00:21:25,119
like

472
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,569
John. So John F Kennedy was often called Jack Kennedy.

473
00:21:28,979 --> 00:21:29,479
And in fact,

474
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:30,810
what's really funny is the reason I know

475
00:21:30,819 --> 00:21:32,939
Richard and Dick is because of Richard Nixon.

476
00:21:32,949 --> 00:21:33,119
Yeah.

477
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,709
Well, and in hindsight now it's, it's, yeah, it's like,

478
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:40,209
-- oh tricky dicky
-- and you know why I know they called Richard Nixon

479
00:21:40,219 --> 00:21:44,630
Dick is because when I was in like seventh or eighth grade,

480
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,280
my history teacher told us

481
00:21:46,385 --> 00:21:49,425
the media would call him tricky dick.

482
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:53,285
And when you tell that to a bunch of teenagers, holy cow,

483
00:21:53,574 --> 00:21:55,165
the class lost it.

484
00:21:55,175 --> 00:21:56,744
It's tough because on the one hand,

485
00:21:56,755 --> 00:22:00,265
I want to allow people to submit good anonymous comments.

486
00:22:00,295 --> 00:22:03,685
I want people to be allowed to use pseudonyms and you know,

487
00:22:04,005 --> 00:22:05,244
pseudo anonymous

488
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:09,300
accounts and I want people to be able to use their real name if they want to

489
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:12,540
and, and strongly attribute their comment to what, you know,

490
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:16,979
like I see with a lot of this COVID related commentary where on the news it's,

491
00:22:16,989 --> 00:22:17,459
you know,

492
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,380
so, and so doctor of epidemiology, it's like,

493
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,660
oh, that's good to know.

494
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:23,579
You know,

495
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:26,119
this isn't just some random nut big spewing off.

496
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:26,800
Exactly.

497
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:31,819
And so I, but how do you do this digitally? And the answer is like, we have no idea.

498
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:34,020
No, we don't, we don't know today.

499
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:34,859
And

500
00:22:35,109 --> 00:22:35,520
so,

501
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,760
so here's the question and here's where we should

502
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:40,500
kind of bring this one back home is so,

503
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:43,630
so we don't know how to necessarily identify people digitally today.

504
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,369
So what it

505
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:49,500
is it more beneficial to society to just shut down on digital comments or do

506
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:53,550
we accept the fact that digital comments are going to be like 80% toxic waste

507
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,630
and start to work out a way to sort them

508
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,390
sort through them and kind of pick out the real ones

509
00:22:59,824 --> 00:23:00,844
worried about the toxic waste.

510
00:23:00,854 --> 00:23:05,055
And I'm more worried about the attempts at manipulation. Same thing, same thing.

511
00:23:05,064 --> 00:23:08,505
No, no, no, no toxic waste and trolling and abuse online.

512
00:23:08,515 --> 00:23:12,895
Cool, whatever, it's whatever. But when for example, a group like

513
00:23:13,055 --> 00:23:13,765
Russia

514
00:23:14,094 --> 00:23:16,685
starts fiddling with your elections.

515
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:21,484
-- That's a problem, right? And so I would separate that.
-- OK. Ignore toxic.

516
00:23:21,494 --> 00:23:25,885
Then take pretend I never said that. And let's just focus on manipulation.

517
00:23:25,974 --> 00:23:27,484
I think with the manipulation,

518
00:23:27,979 --> 00:23:32,439
the best thing I've ever seen for kind of all of that is that transparency piece.

519
00:23:32,449 --> 00:23:34,479
Who said this? Why did you say this?

520
00:23:34,489 --> 00:23:37,640
You know, for example, another thing I've seen that I like is

521
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:43,380
some forums require you to not just sort of make a comment but explain why

522
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,739
or cite some evidence, you know, have some sort of

523
00:23:46,949 --> 00:23:49,040
academic standard if you will to,

524
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:52,420
to cut out all the low hanging fruit and maybe that's part of the solution, you know,

525
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,540
you have to have citations.

526
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,449
Have you ever read Twitter?

527
00:23:55,589 --> 00:23:55,900
Yeah.

528
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:57,300
Well, exactly.

529
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,329
And, and there are people, like, for example, I post those tweets with and you

530
00:24:00,435 --> 00:24:04,454
-- the shell script to verify the numbers I just posted.
-- I truly appreciate that.

531
00:24:04,464 --> 00:24:09,854
-- But what I suspect also no one, no one
-- runs it. I'm trying to do the best I can. And so

532
00:24:10,055 --> 00:24:13,694
I think transparency is a big piece and I think the problem is that

533
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:17,035
the people reading this and that are affected by this don't care generally,

534
00:24:17,045 --> 00:24:18,655
you know, that I hate to lump it in.

535
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:22,854
But you know, the kind of person who listens to Fox news incessantly,

536
00:24:23,189 --> 00:24:23,420
right?

537
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,819
And all the studies when they've tested

538
00:24:24,829 --> 00:24:26,739
people's knowledge of current events and news,

539
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:29,000
all the Fox news viewers score at the bottom.

540
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,160
I've I've seen those studies as well.

541
00:24:31,609 --> 00:24:34,989
We can post them in the link or you can Google it whatever citation I'm not

542
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:36,339
-- posting
-- links to that.

543
00:24:36,369 --> 00:24:37,430
Yeah, but I mean, that's the point,

544
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:41,560
right is I I tend to try and ensure what I'm saying is correct.

545
00:24:41,569 --> 00:24:43,449
The problem is the people spewing this

546
00:24:43,459 --> 00:24:46,560
manipulative stuff have the exact opposite incentive.

547
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:47,280
Right. Right.

548
00:24:47,714 --> 00:24:53,344
Think a big part of it would be for, would be transparency and where possible,

549
00:24:53,354 --> 00:24:56,454
allowing people to strongly tie an identity to it so that, you know,

550
00:24:56,464 --> 00:24:59,755
I don't like arguing from authority, but if we're going to talk about medical stuff,

551
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:03,734
I'm going to probably listen to the people who are medical doctors more so than

552
00:25:04,089 --> 00:25:04,930
everybody else.

553
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:07,260
I mean, look me and that's a great example though. Right?

554
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:11,770
Because you've got in the COVID pandemic, you've had literal doctors

555
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:13,199
talking

556
00:25:13,339 --> 00:25:17,760
and then you've got Big Don Internet 16 saying, oh, well,

557
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:22,859
I read this on a website and an enormous number of people are being like doctors.

558
00:25:22,869 --> 00:25:24,030
What do they know

559
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,839
exactly? Medical science.

560
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:29,099
I don't even know what to say about some of these conversations

561
00:25:29,109 --> 00:25:31,729
I've seen people have where it's like I have no comment.

562
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:33,290
It's like,

563
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,670
I feel like

564
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:39,030
this is a situation where it's like this is the color blue,

565
00:25:39,189 --> 00:25:43,030
this thing here is blue. Do you see they're the same? And then someone else is like,

566
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,989
nope, that's not right. And you're like,

567
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,176
I agree with that guy. He has no evidence. He's not.

568
00:25:48,186 --> 00:25:51,306
I don't even, you know, he clearly has never seen color in his life before,

569
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:52,625
but I'm going to agree with him.

570
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:56,105
And it's like, how do you, how do you deal with that? You know? Yeah.

571
00:25:56,115 --> 00:25:59,105
-- Well,
-- and then to one of the waters is again back to, you know,

572
00:25:59,115 --> 00:26:01,595
even if you get consensus still.

573
00:26:01,605 --> 00:26:03,446
There's going to be one or two outliers who disagree.

574
00:26:03,456 --> 00:26:06,595
Like there are medical doctors who are against masking and it's kind of like, oh,

575
00:26:06,605 --> 00:26:07,135
dear.

576
00:26:07,145 --> 00:26:08,862
And then so they cherry pick their evidence,

577
00:26:09,261 --> 00:26:11,141
you know, it's like global climate change, right?

578
00:26:11,151 --> 00:26:12,001
The vast,

579
00:26:12,011 --> 00:26:16,881
vast majority of anybody with an ounce of scientific knowledge agrees with this.

580
00:26:16,891 --> 00:26:18,222
You know, the evidence all agrees with this,

581
00:26:18,232 --> 00:26:20,842
but there's a few outliers and of course they go, what about this guy?

582
00:26:20,852 --> 00:26:21,771
You know, he's right.

583
00:26:21,781 --> 00:26:24,531
And then they use the famous, like Albert Einstein argument of like, yeah,

584
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,911
they're going against the flow and you'll be proven wrong

585
00:26:26,921 --> 00:26:28,911
in a decade and you'll see how right we were.

586
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,819
It's like, I don't think so, but whatever, II, I don't know, I, I do think

587
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:39,180
the ease of which manipulation now occurs, especially on places like Facebook.

588
00:26:39,189 --> 00:26:40,619
So I think in recent times,

589
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,910
Facebook is probably about the worst thing that has

590
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,510
happened to Western democracy and democracy in general.

591
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:51,900
And, you know, but at the same time, it's, it's clear that we can't shut it off

592
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,750
-- or even fix it. Maybe
-- it is a delicate balance.

593
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,020
Now, I did read something the other day that I will try to locate,

594
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,979
but I don't think I can, it was talking about the fact that

595
00:27:03,229 --> 00:27:09,170
if you look at a lot of the minority communities and getting messages out, like,

596
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,739
for example, the, the level of we'll say

597
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:14,699
police misconduct in the United States

598
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:15,780
is

599
00:27:16,109 --> 00:27:20,030
it has been an enormous story for the last probably year.

600
00:27:20,229 --> 00:27:22,630
And the fundamental reason for that is these minorities

601
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,729
communities have found a voice in social media.

602
00:27:25,109 --> 00:27:30,800
And so it's, it's one side to say like Facebook is bad for a functional democracy,

603
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,130
but on the other side,

604
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:34,699
it's also empowering these groups because they

605
00:27:34,709 --> 00:27:37,449
have social media to amplify their message.

606
00:27:37,459 --> 00:27:38,229
And so

607
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,939
-- it's such a complex ridiculous problem.
-- I don't know.

608
00:27:42,949 --> 00:27:46,420
How do we make it harder for people to do the,

609
00:27:46,569 --> 00:27:50,180
how do we basically implement the evil bit? That's what we need. We need the evil bit.

610
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,469
Well, and, and not just that, like

611
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,229
all of the vast majority of what we've talked

612
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:59,359
about so far today is really been people driven,

613
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,650
but once we unleash the robots,

614
00:28:01,869 --> 00:28:04,089
it becomes an entirely different problem.

615
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:07,079
And now I have no doubt someone is going to

616
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:08,689
send me a comment

617
00:28:08,829 --> 00:28:10,680
of the weird

618
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:15,130
system in the book, Dodge or what is it Dodge or burn in hell.

619
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,979
-- Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know what you mean
-- where they, they basically just,

620
00:28:18,459 --> 00:28:20,949
they astroturf the internet

621
00:28:21,089 --> 00:28:25,130
to make social media comments worthless. And like I'm not saying

622
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:26,849
that's the wrong answer.

623
00:28:26,869 --> 00:28:30,569
They use masking where they just flood it with so much other crap. But

624
00:28:30,859 --> 00:28:31,560
you can't,

625
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:35,599
-- you can't see it and it's fall or Dodge and
-- hell fall or dodgin hell. That's it.

626
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,219
That's it.

627
00:28:36,329 --> 00:28:39,040
And I've often thought about that because I you know,

628
00:28:39,369 --> 00:28:40,180
there's only four Curt

629
00:28:40,329 --> 00:28:42,359
Seares on the planet. So it's pretty easy to find me online.

630
00:28:42,979 --> 00:28:43,689
And

631
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:47,170
obviously, if you do things like minus security, then you get, you know,

632
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,959
it narrows it down quite a bit

633
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,900
and I kind of wondered about writing a bot

634
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,650
that floods Facebook with a constant stream

635
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,880
of gibberish and Twitter with gibberish and

636
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,449
all these other places because there are

637
00:28:57,459 --> 00:28:59,390
professional services that will do this for you

638
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,449
in order to make things like, you know,

639
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,180
that one time I drove over a, you know, I,

640
00:29:04,189 --> 00:29:07,459
I drove a busload of nuns into a river and killed them all.

641
00:29:07,469 --> 00:29:09,540
You know, I'd like, I can't make that go away,

642
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:12,520
but I can put so much other junk on the internet that it's hard to find.

643
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:13,449
It's on page 17.

644
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:18,479
That's what, that's what Boris Johnson did with his, his, I paint buses. Right.

645
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:25,099
He got the press to Astroturf away his bad stories. Exactly.

646
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:25,770
And so

647
00:29:26,459 --> 00:29:26,750
I,

648
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:27,469
I,

649
00:29:27,969 --> 00:29:29,119
the one

650
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:32,489
answer would be using artificial intelligence to process this

651
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,319
and maybe summarize it or maybe kind of help.

652
00:29:35,329 --> 00:29:38,010
But the problem is there's no real strong market for that.

653
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,000
I'm not going to pay for that.

654
00:29:39,219 --> 00:29:40,319
No, I, I agree.

655
00:29:40,329 --> 00:29:40,739
And I mean,

656
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:45,760
that's maybe one of the challenges and now we just need competing like a I turf wars

657
00:29:46,209 --> 00:29:46,979
and

658
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,359
I don't know, I don't know, we've, we've run ourselves out of time

659
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,560
and I feel

660
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,199
probably more confused now. Than I thought I was when we started this conversation.

661
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:01,160
So I, I guess, you know what, you know, it gives me hope and, and here's how I'll, I'll,

662
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:06,300
I'll end it is, this is a hard problem and there's not going to be an easy answer for it.

663
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:08,040
But I feel like

664
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:12,119
as long as it's discussed and understood

665
00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:15,040
that there will, we will find an answer.

666
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:19,770
It's when we throw our hands in the air and say it's too hard. I give up that it is over.

667
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,890
-- I have no doubt we can solve this.
-- I love that right now.

668
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,609
And A I ethics and morality is becoming a real issue.

669
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:25,920
And you know,
