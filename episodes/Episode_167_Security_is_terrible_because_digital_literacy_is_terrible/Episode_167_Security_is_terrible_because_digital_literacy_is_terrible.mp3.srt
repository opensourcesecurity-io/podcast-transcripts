Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 167 with myself,

1
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,380
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,369
-- Josh Bresser. How
-- you doing, man?

3
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,549
Uh Quite well. Thanksgiving was nice.

4
00:00:16,569 --> 00:00:19,209
-- Ate some good food.
-- Oh, fake Thanksgiving. That's right.

5
00:00:19,639 --> 00:00:20,159
Yes.

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,379
Right. Which I guess is ironic because Canadian Thanksgiving

7
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,659
is on

8
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:29,299
Columbus Day in the United States.

9
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:34,340
Both of which are probably hideously insensitive topics for the native peoples.

10
00:00:34,349 --> 00:00:38,590
So Thanksgiving is a harvest more of a harvest Thanksgiving thing here than a,

11
00:00:38,599 --> 00:00:41,099
you know, thanks for signing over those rights.

12
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,139
I

13
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,259
see. Not, not like American Thanksgiving. I got you.

14
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:44,639
OK.

15
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,060
It's not quite as bad, I would say.

16
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,479
All right. All right. That's fair.

17
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:55,959
Although in the US now they are celebrating indigenous peoples on Columbus Day,

18
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,580
which I like and is very nice.

19
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,240
In fact, where I live, the state governor recently signed,

20
00:01:01,419 --> 00:01:04,010
I, I don't know, executive order a bill or something or other

21
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:09,000
that, that made Columbus Day Indigenous People Day, which is awesome. So,

22
00:01:09,139 --> 00:01:12,199
and if you don't know people, but Christopher Columbus was a terrible person.

23
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:15,059
Go look him up. All right. Cool. So I have uh,

24
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:18,339
an interesting story to tell prior to

25
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,860
our, our main topic that we want to discuss today.

26
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,980
So I have Phillips hue light bulbs

27
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:28,779
and I've owned these for nearly a year now

28
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:29,580
and

29
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:30,819
they are,

30
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,330
they will say amusing to me,

31
00:01:32,339 --> 00:01:35,970
they change colors and turn on and off and whatever normal light bulb things.

32
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,580
Right. And one of them died.

33
00:01:37,589 --> 00:01:39,599
-- I'm pretty sure
-- changing colors was not a normal

34
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,129
light bulb thing when you and I grew up.

35
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,260
Well, that's fair.

36
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:42,980
That's fair.

37
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:46,139
Uh, mind you not play music.

38
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,739
I wonder if I can make it play music if I made

39
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,519
it turn on and off really fast or something and whatever,

40
00:01:50,529 --> 00:01:50,949
I'll figure this

41
00:01:51,089 --> 00:01:51,120
out

42
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,150
anyway.

43
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:52,519
So,

44
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,040
one of them died and it was really interesting because it would

45
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,809
just start flashing on and off and it was super annoying.

46
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,580
-- And so it didn't
-- like die, die. Like the, it made light is just

47
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,209
whatever.

48
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:02,540
So

49
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,150
stuff and it died.

50
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,620
I don't know. I don't know. That's the question.

51
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:10,380
And so, and what's interesting though is it would still basically turn on and off

52
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,100
when I would command it to.

53
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:13,929
It's just, it would also

54
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,729
usually it'd be on for a couple of minutes and it would start to blink,

55
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,690
flash on and off and

56
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,410
it started out where it would do this maybe once a day

57
00:02:21,619 --> 00:02:24,630
and eventually after a couple of days, it basically,

58
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:27,949
like after less than five minutes it would happen.

59
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:30,669
And so I contact the manufacturer

60
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,130
and they asked me a ton of crazy questions, which I found really interesting.

61
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:37,509
They wanted to know how many hours a day I left it on. They wanted to understand

62
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:40,220
is it connected to a dimmer switch? Which it's not that one.

63
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:42,470
I get, they wanted a picture of the lamp,

64
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,149
they wanted me to test it in another lamp and take a picture of that and like, they,

65
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,059
it was kind of wild but it kind of got me thinking as well.

66
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:49,639
I guess in

67
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:49,759
the

68
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:55,059
history of light bulbs, like what you plugged it into has basically never mattered.

69
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:57,539
And now it totally matters because there's

70
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,990
a computer running inside of the light bulb

71
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,789
and

72
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:02,190
it's broken

73
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,110
-- and now they want to know why.
-- Well, and I could definitely see heat being an issue.

74
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:06,339
I mean,

75
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,240
heat used to be a problem with light bulbs and that

76
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,119
if it were way too hot they would burn out.

77
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:10,660
But, I mean,

78
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,020
it was kind of a binary. It either worked or didn't work.

79
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:19,179
-- And when it stopped working, it stopped working.
-- These cue bulbs get pretty hot.

80
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:22,940
And so I bet if I installed them in like a can light setting up on the ceiling,

81
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:25,259
it would probably cook itself because it's,

82
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,899
I, I wouldn't say it's too hot to touch,

83
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:32,119
but it's uncomfortable to unscrew when it's on is what I would describe it as,

84
00:03:32,509 --> 00:03:33,929
which is, and that's a good point.

85
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:38,059
I haven't installed any of the quote unquote, smart light bulbs. I have in a

86
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:39,809
enclosed fixture,

87
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,809
like they're all in lamps or things that

88
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,110
are meant to where they get ventilation because

89
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:48,809
quite frankly, I don't 100% trust them to not catch fire if they get hot.

90
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,639
Right. Right. Right.

91
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,039
So, so anyway,

92
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,800
but the coolest thing and I'm gonna give Phillips a

93
00:03:55,809 --> 00:03:59,000
huge plus plus for this is I answer other questions.

94
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:01,169
I send them all the pictures they asked for

95
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:03,800
and then they basically just replied finally with,

96
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:05,839
we put a new bulb in the mail for you.

97
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,089
And I was like, what?

98
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:07,440
I

99
00:04:07,649 --> 00:04:09,350
want the old one back. No.

100
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,490
And now, I mean,

101
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,419
I, I'm tearing that sucker apart. Right. I'm gonna, I want to know it's inside.

102
00:04:14,429 --> 00:04:16,829
So I want to, I want to see pictures of the insides of it.

103
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,940
I will totally blog about this

104
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:21,630
and, and make plenty of noise when I do it.

105
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:23,510
So, yeah, by all means, I mean,

106
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,230
I'll let everybody know when I do because like what's in it?

107
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,000
I don't know.

108
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,190
Let's find out and,

109
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,529
and if I'm lucky they have J tag enabled so we can really do some fun stuff with it.

110
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:32,690
But

111
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:32,929
there

112
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,829
space for that in there

113
00:04:35,429 --> 00:04:36,329
for J tag,

114
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:39,209
they're all just, they, they're surface amount contacts now.

115
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,230
It's not like the good old days where it was like a big freaking plug you plug in. Yeah.

116
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:44,649
Yeah, you just solder stuff on whatever. It's

117
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,489
no big deal. Doesn't matter. I'm ruining it anyway.

118
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:49,649
I mean, I just, I wonder, like, with the volume they're doing, you know,

119
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,890
removing J Tag saves them 1/10 of a penny, which,

120
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:54,910
-- when you're making light bulbs that adds up,
-- I don't know.

121
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,839
Well, probably not though because, I mean, J tag is such a standard.

122
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,279
I bet they use most of the chips.

123
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,980
They have probably come with its standard and it gives them a really

124
00:05:01,989 --> 00:05:04,929
easy way to test the gear before they ship it out the door.

125
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:06,320
I bet, I bet it's there.

126
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:08,239
And what can happen though is in most production

127
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,869
settings you're supposed to disable the J tag on

128
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:15,279
before it leaves the building and like nobody does that. So that's good though.

129
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,880
That's great if you're a hardware hacker person. So, so anyway. All right, cool.

130
00:05:19,059 --> 00:05:19,920
Uh Yeah, that's, that's why

131
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,799
story. So I'm, I couldn't believe it. It's like this is fantastic.

132
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,880
And then of course, the security weirdo in me thought, oh, I should,

133
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:30,000
I could just do this and, and pretend all my light bulbs are bad.

134
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:30,720
And then I thought,

135
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,859
I bet after the second one they're gonna make me start sending them back in.

136
00:05:33,869 --> 00:05:37,540
-- Did they have you send them the serial number of the
-- bulb? Yep. Yep. Serial number.

137
00:05:37,549 --> 00:05:39,250
They actually had me take a bunch of pictures of

138
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,500
the bulb with all the weird writings on it.

139
00:05:41,989 --> 00:05:44,880
-- So.
-- Oh, maybe they wanted to make sure it wasn't like a counterfeit.

140
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:45,929
Oh, that's fair.

141
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,920
I didn't even think of that. But, yeah, I bet you're right

142
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,600
because those few bulbs, I think,

143
00:05:49,609 --> 00:05:53,029
I remember when I looked at them last a year or two ago they were not cheap.

144
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:56,329
Yeah, they're like 50 bucks a bulb for these particular ones.

145
00:05:56,339 --> 00:05:59,529
They were, they were given to me as a Christmas present. So

146
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,399
now you can get cheaper

147
00:06:01,505 --> 00:06:02,325
ones

148
00:06:02,524 --> 00:06:04,195
that are because in fact, on my garage,

149
00:06:04,204 --> 00:06:08,244
I have less expensive Phillips bulbs that I think were $10 a piece.

150
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,024
And they obviously turn on at night and turn

151
00:06:10,035 --> 00:06:12,915
off at daytime and the convenient thing about those.

152
00:06:12,924 --> 00:06:16,325
So the reason I have hue bulbs is my,

153
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,765
the far end of my garage is pretty far from my house.

154
00:06:18,774 --> 00:06:21,035
It's an ex, it's a detached garage

155
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:22,500
and Zigbee

156
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:28,859
does like mesh networking between the bulbs and so the far bulb can't see my Wi Fi

157
00:06:29,049 --> 00:06:32,540
but it can see the bulb next to it, which can see the bulb next to it,

158
00:06:32,549 --> 00:06:34,420
which can see my Phillips U Bridge.

159
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,000
-- So
-- it works.

160
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,739
I kind of want to see how many light bulbs you can put in a chain. And

161
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:38,549
I,

162
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,190
I did wonder this, but I have never tried. I also wonder this with

163
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,119
like mesh networking for Wi Fi. How many, how many, how many Google Wi

164
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,380
Fi access points?

165
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,149
I'm sure they have some programmed limit,

166
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,390
but I don't I wonder what it is and I actually looked

167
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,679
it up and I could not find an answer to that question.

168
00:06:55,869 --> 00:06:56,980
People kept saying

169
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,549
-- you really don't want more than one
-- hop. I'm guessing it would be low.

170
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:02,980
It, yeah, it's probably like, three or less is my guess.

171
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,959
And everyone online kept saying you don't want more than one hop.

172
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:09,510
And it's like, well, yes, I do because I want to see how many hops I can do

173
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:13,660
but whatever, whatever anyway. Anyway. So Pew research,

174
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,730
you know who Pew research is

175
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,130
vaguely.

176
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:17,609
Yeah.

177
00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:19,850
Ok. I'm not an expert either.

178
00:07:19,859 --> 00:07:24,339
I'll say, but they're a research institute in the United States that is well known

179
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,670
for doing like polling data

180
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,630
and understanding various social trends we'll say.

181
00:07:29,975 --> 00:07:30,595
And

182
00:07:30,845 --> 00:07:33,415
they just released a report

183
00:07:33,765 --> 00:07:36,174
because it, it hasn't been long since the time of this recording.

184
00:07:36,184 --> 00:07:38,015
I just ran across it and it intrigued me

185
00:07:38,144 --> 00:07:41,605
where they asked people what these seemingly bizarre

186
00:07:41,614 --> 00:07:44,535
questions about kind of the internet and online.

187
00:07:44,545 --> 00:07:45,375
And I thought

188
00:07:45,605 --> 00:07:48,454
this is an extremely interesting topic

189
00:07:48,464 --> 00:07:50,774
given we're always talking about social issues

190
00:07:50,785 --> 00:07:54,195
with security and how we can't fix people and the technology and this,

191
00:07:54,204 --> 00:07:54,924
that and another.

192
00:07:54,934 --> 00:07:57,035
And so I thought this is a

193
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:01,160
amazing topic for us because it hits on many of the points we have.

194
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:05,059
And the last question is the best we, we, we'll kind of go through the questions,

195
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,130
we can talk about them a little bit and then

196
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,929
we can cover some of the results which some of them are really interesting.

197
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,769
Some of them are expected, I think. And so we'll start with number one.

198
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,440
And these are, these are strangely worded. I won't lie to you.

199
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,940
I didn't write them whatever we're going to roll with it.

200
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:21,299
The first question it sounds like was phishing

201
00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:24,059
scams can occur on social media websites,

202
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:28,640
email or text messages and they don't use the Oxford comma in this so shame on them.

203
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:29,579
But

204
00:08:30,549 --> 00:08:33,719
uh my answer to that would be yes. Yes, they can.

205
00:08:34,058 --> 00:08:34,719
Yeah. Right.

206
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:37,520
The I think the answer to most of these is yes, actually.

207
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:43,169
But so 67% of people that responded to this answered correctly.

208
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:46,440
And now mind you, there is, uh I, I looked at some of the, the, the people,

209
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:50,270
the respondents and it looks like you have a pretty fair breakdown between age

210
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,640
demographics of age as well as education level is how they broke it apart.

211
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:57,859
So it's not like this is heavily weighted in one direction or another because

212
00:08:57,869 --> 00:09:01,359
obviously what we'll get to in a little bit is like some of the questions

213
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,809
we'll say we're, we're heavily dependent on age

214
00:09:05,369 --> 00:09:10,010
or, and most of them had a pretty typical breakdown, I think between

215
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,469
uh level of education where you had like high school or less,

216
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:15,869
you had some college and you had college.

217
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,270
Plus.

218
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,500
Well, I'm always reminded of that whole, what was it somebody,

219
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,099
it was like a Yahoo or a Google type thing where they did that thing on the street,

220
00:09:22,109 --> 00:09:23,169
you know, what's the address bar?

221
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:23,909
What does it mean?

222
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,820
There's one of those in here,

223
00:09:25,989 --> 00:09:27,909
you know, and people just really did not

224
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:30,260
by and large were not all that we'll get

225
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:31,280
over it.

226
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,219
So, anyway,

227
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,979
67% of people

228
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:38,909
knew that phishing scams can occur right by email, text messages, whatever.

229
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,789
-- So
-- 60 7% said yes.

230
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,250
Was there an option to say like some of the above or was it just yes or no?

231
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:50,130
So it looks like there is yes or no or unsure appears to be the the possible response

232
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,830
and you had 18% got it wrong. 15% didn't know 67% got it right.

233
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,989
And I feel like this is one of those things that everyone is so exposed to. Now,

234
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:05,830
if you are even remotely aware, I think you're going to understand this.

235
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,270
And I feel like we also have the situation of 20% of

236
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:14,219
any survey you ask like the people probably have comprehension issues.

237
00:10:14,229 --> 00:10:15,789
So I think anything

238
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,349
near 80% is basically 100% for the most part.

239
00:10:19,859 --> 00:10:21,539
Yeah, but I mean, you know,

240
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:24,989
I I was just looking through my spam folder today and I I got that email saying,

241
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,849
you know, my my email inbox is at 510 megabytes out of a 500 megabyte quota.

242
00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:31,280
And my first thought was like Holy.

243
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:35,000
I don't think I've had only 500 megabytes in my email in box since about

244
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,690
-- 2001. Yeah. But
-- you know what a megabyte is.

245
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,390
They might as well have made the subject line.

246
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,150
Like your email is using six bananas out of eight quick.

247
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:45,479
You need more bananas and like most people would,

248
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,599
yeah, that would make more sense to them because they know what a banana is.

249
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,169
But here's the thing. It's not a matter of

250
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,539
do the phishing scams work or not. It's just the awareness of it.

251
00:10:54,549 --> 00:10:56,450
Well, but that's the thing is I would say that

252
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,599
even though people, ok, let me put it this way,

253
00:10:58,609 --> 00:11:03,119
are pretty much all drivers exposed to people using turn signals.

254
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,919
Yes. Do all drivers use their turn signals? No.

255
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:12,940
Right. Like the number of drivers I see doing really illegal things.

256
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,710
You know, we just did a road trip for Thanksgiving this weekend and

257
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:19,250
some of the stuff we saw on the highway, you know, people like tailgating us.

258
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:19,830
So we

259
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,750
pull off, you know, because we're passing, they're tailgating us,

260
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,119
we pull over into the slow lane

261
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,140
and they pull over and tailgate us some more. Like

262
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,760
if you want to go fast, that's what the left lane is for, you know.

263
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:31,450
So

264
00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:34,460
-- I don't,
-- this is the least interesting question.

265
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:35,989
All right, we're gonna, we're gonna keep going.

266
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,960
So the next one I found this one interests me.

267
00:11:37,969 --> 00:11:38,640
It says cookies,

268
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,020
allow websites to track user visits and site

269
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,780
activity and 63% of people got that right.

270
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:49,700
-- That shocks me. I'm amazed that 63% of people know what a cookie is.
-- You know what?

271
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,820
Probably because of all the GDPR warnings.

272
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:52,419
Oh,

273
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:53,770
I bet you're right. The

274
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:53,989
last

275
00:11:54,229 --> 00:11:54,500
couple of,

276
00:11:54,849 --> 00:11:55,309
like,

277
00:11:55,429 --> 00:11:56,299
whoa.

278
00:11:56,429 --> 00:11:57,099
Yes,

279
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:01,030
-- they work. They're actually good for some.
-- Holy, I'm not

280
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:01,780
holy crap. I'm not

281
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:05,739
sure. What, what was the rate before the GDPR warnings? Like 60%.

282
00:12:06,849 --> 00:12:10,820
I mean, in all seriousness, I think before all those terrible cookie warnings,

283
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,419
it was probably very low because you'd be like a cookie.

284
00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:16,359
-- What, what, what are you talking about? Well,
-- you don't see them, right?

285
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:19,380
Like, unless you're a weirdo like you or me who runs like a cookie manager,

286
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,979
I mean, and, and I'll be fair to be fair.

287
00:12:21,989 --> 00:12:25,500
I, I'm still somewhat shocked when I go to a major site,

288
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:29,390
the amount of third party cookies and everything getting jammed in there. Right.

289
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:29,469
It's

290
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:32,840
like, um, I think it was like it was, or even you go to, um,

291
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:36,330
like wired or something and they, they're doing like 20 cookies

292
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:40,210
and some of it I get, they're like your screen size and your

293
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,960
-- whatever. But.
-- Right.

294
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:47,239
Right. No, I, I know, man. Why not go, go easy. They work. Right. All right.

295
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,489
We'll keep, we'll keep going. All right.

296
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,789
So, anyway, I guess chocolate up for GDPR or whatever the cookie law is,

297
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:52,739
I don't think it's GDPR.

298
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,719
I'd be curious to know if,

299
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:56,460
if people knew about the other tracking methods that are in use,

300
00:12:56,469 --> 00:12:59,719
like using HSTS headers or the html canvas.

301
00:12:59,729 --> 00:13:01,840
No, they don't know about those. Come on.

302
00:13:02,184 --> 00:13:03,244
No way.

303
00:13:03,335 --> 00:13:03,765
Actually,

304
00:13:03,775 --> 00:13:07,375
I'm going to see if they have historical data on this now and I'll see if the

305
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:11,875
cookie answer existed maybe a couple of years ago and if people got it this right.

306
00:13:11,885 --> 00:13:14,145
So that, that's interesting. Interesting. All right, I'll keep going.

307
00:13:14,155 --> 00:13:15,635
So this one, I'm

308
00:13:15,825 --> 00:13:16,765
shocked

309
00:13:16,895 --> 00:13:18,924
is as high as it is also as well.

310
00:13:18,934 --> 00:13:21,025
It says advertising is the largest source

311
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,044
of revenue for most social media platforms.

312
00:13:23,054 --> 00:13:27,135
And 59% of people said yes, 9% said no. So like who are those 9%?

313
00:13:27,275 --> 00:13:28,875
And 32% weren't sure.

314
00:13:29,155 --> 00:13:30,294
So I feel like

315
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,979
59% is

316
00:13:33,169 --> 00:13:36,179
I, I want to say it should be higher, but I'm not surprised.

317
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:40,500
I suspect it might be one of those classic things where, well, I guess they must be

318
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,380
making a bunch of money, but

319
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,650
I suspect a lot of people would be quite shocked if they knew how much money, you know,

320
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,919
a Google or a Facebook or linkedin.

321
00:13:50,534 --> 00:13:53,825
And, and not only that, how little their data is actually worth,

322
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,875
which kind of puts it into perspective of

323
00:13:55,885 --> 00:13:58,474
how many people are actually using this stuff.

324
00:13:58,484 --> 00:14:02,674
So I, because I mean, I, well, I know the answer to that is yes, but at the same time,

325
00:14:02,684 --> 00:14:04,054
I also know it's kind of, it's

326
00:14:04,205 --> 00:14:05,934
somewhat nuanced in the sense of a lot of

327
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:08,994
these sites aren't actually making a ton of money,

328
00:14:09,719 --> 00:14:09,940
you know,

329
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,510
or they're losing it hand over fist because

330
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,260
they're still in their growth phase or whatever

331
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,130
when people pick up the newspaper and it's like, you know,

332
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,979
there's a reason that only costs 25 cents,

333
00:14:18,109 --> 00:14:20,380
no newspaper costs 25 cents anymore.

334
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,700
And this is one of my primary complaints about the newspaper.

335
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,229
I love reading a paper newspaper.

336
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:29,859
I love sitting down in a chair opening the newspaper and drinking my coffee

337
00:14:29,965 --> 00:14:30,465
while I read it.

338
00:14:30,474 --> 00:14:34,565
Except the actual paper newspaper has now become so ridiculously expensive

339
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:38,344
that I only subscribe to online editions because they are like

340
00:14:38,354 --> 00:14:42,065
1/10 of the price and it breaks my heart because print

341
00:14:42,075 --> 00:14:46,265
is so it's like printing and distribution is expensive and hard.

342
00:14:46,275 --> 00:14:47,104
But anyway, all right,

343
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,065
we're going to keep going. So now here's one

344
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,440
that confused me.

345
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:56,400
I'll say it says privacy policies are contracts between websites

346
00:14:56,409 --> 00:14:58,679
and users about how those sites will use their data.

347
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:03,260
25% got it wrong. 48% got it right. 27% didn't know.

348
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:07,239
And the hang up I had here though is I don't know if this is exactly the wording.

349
00:15:07,344 --> 00:15:08,145
They asked the people,

350
00:15:08,155 --> 00:15:12,195
but the word contract hangs me up a little bit because I feel like it,

351
00:15:12,205 --> 00:15:13,765
-- it
-- depends on jurisdiction because I know,

352
00:15:14,395 --> 00:15:18,044
you know, in the US under, I'm spacing out, what is that law?

353
00:15:18,054 --> 00:15:19,965
The old one that basically says, you know,

354
00:15:20,215 --> 00:15:24,164
terms of service on a website or a contract and that if you violate them

355
00:15:24,494 --> 00:15:28,304
civilly you don't be charged. Oh, it's the old one from, like, 20 years ago anyways.

356
00:15:28,744 --> 00:15:30,284
But, you know, there's other jurisdictions.

357
00:15:30,294 --> 00:15:33,645
My understanding of a contract is, you know, both parties have to enter into it

358
00:15:33,794 --> 00:15:35,375
willingly and knowingly. And

359
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:36,244
I mean,

360
00:15:36,729 --> 00:15:38,770
I, I go to cnn.com and I'm,

361
00:15:38,929 --> 00:15:41,349
-- I don't remember clicking through a contract,
-- right.

362
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:46,650
-- I feel like this one has a lot of ambiguity. I think
-- the intent is that, yeah, I mean,

363
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:47,630
in theory,

364
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,760
the privacy policy is what they are and are not going to do

365
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:54,390
with my data and there's some sort of legal teeth to that,

366
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,549
especially now with, you know,

367
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:56,789
a GDPR in Europe.

368
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:00,590
But fundamentally, I would have answered that question.

369
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:02,530
Yes, because I, that's the answer they want.

370
00:16:02,539 --> 00:16:05,700
But I would actually, I would generally argue that the answer is no,

371
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:09,169
because they also every single one of those agreements reserves the right to,

372
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:13,020
you know, modify the terms of this at any time with like 30 days or no warning or blah,

373
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:13,450
blah, blah.

374
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:17,099
And I, I read further in this report and it was,

375
00:16:17,289 --> 00:16:21,059
they, they didn't explain away any ambiguity that I saw.

376
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:21,780
So

377
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:25,780
I don't know this one. And now this is really the weirdest one I think

378
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:28,429
in terms of bizarre expectations.

379
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,650
So anyway, take that, take that for what it's worth. I know. Here's a good one.

380
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:36,030
It says net neutrality describes principle that internet service

381
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:39,080
providers should treat all traffic on their networks equally.

382
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:44,590
Now, this one was interesting. 12% got it wrong. 45% got it right. 42% didn't know.

383
00:16:44,609 --> 00:16:48,760
-- And I feel like that's probably in line with
-- that actually doesn't shock me at all.

384
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,299
Yeah, that,

385
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:51,909
-- that's about what I would expect because
-- a lot of people

386
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:54,260
don't know what net neutrality is in the first place.

387
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,085
And even if you've heard of net neutrality,

388
00:16:56,094 --> 00:16:59,104
it is a rather subtle and difficult concept to explain

389
00:16:59,114 --> 00:17:02,265
because what does it mean to treat network traffic equally?

390
00:17:02,284 --> 00:17:03,565
-- Right.
-- Right. Exactly.

391
00:17:03,575 --> 00:17:07,473
And most people don't even know what network traffic really is. So, it's,

392
00:17:07,574 --> 00:17:08,964
it's not a truck. Right.

393
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:10,555
I thought we were series

394
00:17:11,005 --> 00:17:13,954
-- of tubes.
-- Yeah, with trucks that jam the tubes up.

395
00:17:14,005 --> 00:17:16,525
Right. Exactly. Exactly.

396
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,444
That's exactly it.

397
00:17:17,694 --> 00:17:19,685
So, yeah, I don't know that, that one is interesting.

398
00:17:19,694 --> 00:17:23,204
I don't have a lot to say about it. I think it's kind of expected. Now, here's the one

399
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:24,545
that I think

400
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:26,239
tells the story.

401
00:17:26,568 --> 00:17:30,999
Http S colon slash slash in a URL means

402
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:34,019
that information entered into the site is encrypted.

403
00:17:34,029 --> 00:17:35,779
15%. Got it wrong.

404
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:37,389
30% got it. Right.

405
00:17:37,509 --> 00:17:41,379
53% didn't know. Holy cow.

406
00:17:41,389 --> 00:17:44,818
I would say that's an ambiguous question because number one,

407
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:45,849
the

408
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:46,689
traffic is, you

409
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:46,949
know,

410
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:48,479
I know,

411
00:17:48,989 --> 00:17:49,150
but I'm

412
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:55,000
saying, I know the intent, 53% of people don't know what HTTP S means.

413
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,900
That is what that question says.

414
00:17:57,089 --> 00:18:00,969
Uh turn on your web browser and go to a website

415
00:18:01,239 --> 00:18:03,219
and tell me if you see HTTP S

416
00:18:03,689 --> 00:18:05,459
and the answer is no, you don't. They took that away.

417
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:08,199
That is fair. Chrome did take it away.

418
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:10,540
So you're not wrong

419
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:10,920
but

420
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,000
on my phone

421
00:18:12,209 --> 00:18:12,900
hasn't for

422
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,859
so

423
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,319
in fairness. The other thing too is, I mean, well, this is the classic.

424
00:18:19,329 --> 00:18:22,180
Sure, the, you know, the channel between me and CNN

425
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:25,079
edge or whoever's edge is encrypted. But

426
00:18:25,459 --> 00:18:27,930
you know, the actual data I'm sending to them is then

427
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,050
decrypted and generally handled in plaintext. I mean,

428
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:32,420
people generally don't

429
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,329
properly

430
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:33,560
bad

431
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,760
stuff at all. So I'm not at all surprised that people don't know what HTTP S is.

432
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,739
I mean, because we had 20 years of the lock icon and, and what,

433
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,900
what was the result of that?

434
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,900
Well, they decided to get rid of the lock icon.

435
00:18:45,589 --> 00:18:46,260
Uh They

436
00:18:46,589 --> 00:18:48,760
-- did, well, they got
-- everybody got rid of the lock icon.

437
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:49,079
It's

438
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,099
-- true.
-- There's no, now there's only a not lock icon, which is,

439
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,180
yeah. Ok. You're right. I'll agree with you.

440
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,400
-- Oh,
-- actually, no, we're wrong if you click.

441
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:02,219
So in Chrome it shows me a lock icon next to the website and if I click the URL

442
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,699
spans it to http SF

443
00:19:03,979 --> 00:19:04,640
slash slash, but

444
00:19:05,219 --> 00:19:05,380
does

445
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:05,890
that.

446
00:19:06,329 --> 00:19:06,560
Well, yeah.

447
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,650
Ok. So

448
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,849
this is, I feel like,

449
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:14,130
oh, and it does show a lock on my phone. I'm also mistaken on my phone.

450
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,770
-- Yeah,
-- I see a lock here actually.

451
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,410
But who's tapping the address bar?

452
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,359
Who's tapping the address bar on their browser?

453
00:19:20,569 --> 00:19:23,150
-- You're gonna edit it? No.
-- Yeah. Yeah.

454
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,640
Well, most people don't.

455
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,319
Ok.

456
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,170
I,

457
00:19:26,449 --> 00:19:29,420
I got you. That's fair. That's fair. Maybe they should have asked about the lock.

458
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:33,560
So, anyway, let's keep going. Whatsapp and Instagram are both owned by Facebook.

459
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:38,829
22% got it wrong. 29% got it right. And 49% didn't know.

460
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:42,310
Uh, I know whatsapp is owned by Facebook for sure. I'm pretty sure

461
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,060
-- Instagram is because they
-- both are.

462
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:46,609
-- Yeah,
-- because my understanding is Facebook is not

463
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,229
hot with

464
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:53,050
-- kids. So the solution is to buy the stuff that is hot with the kids, which
-- is

465
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:57,040
-- Facebook, Instagram,
-- which is Instagram, WhatsApp and Snapchat. Uh,

466
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,089
what about,

467
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,119
-- isn't there that one called tiktok or something? Uh,
-- is tiktok an app?

468
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,890
I thought tiktok was just a video website thing.

469
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,569
I'm over 40. How would I know?

470
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:10,290
That's true. Get off my lawn. You kids?

471
00:20:10,729 --> 00:20:12,089
Seriously.

472
00:20:12,229 --> 00:20:16,290
-- I'm using the internet on the computer.
-- I assume it was a Vine Replacement.

473
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,869
-- No, it's an
-- app. What's tiktok is an app? Well, no, I know it's an app but I don't.

474
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,339
Is it a social media app or? I guess it can, youtube is a social media site. So.

475
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:27,119
-- All right.
-- Yeah. Is Instagram a social media app?

476
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,119
Ah, yes. All right. Whatever.

477
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,989
I'm, I computer Kurt. It's fine.

478
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,329
Anyway,

479
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,469
I mean, can you imagine asking people basic questions about electricity? Like,

480
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:40,369
how many phases of power does your house have

481
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,790
-- usually?
-- Well, my house has two but they produce it in three. Whatever.

482
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:43,959
I'm,

483
00:20:43,969 --> 00:20:45,079
I'm the worst person to answer

484
00:20:45,089 --> 00:20:47,329
that question because I'm actually insanely educated

485
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:51,989
or, or simply put, you know, how many, what AMP service does your house have?

486
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,839
Is it like 100 or 200?

487
00:20:53,849 --> 00:20:56,920
-- I
-- have two 100 AMP service which I have some funny stories about how I got it.

488
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,050
I got it for free

489
00:20:58,219 --> 00:21:00,530
due to a variety of hilarious events.

490
00:21:01,189 --> 00:21:01,380
Oh,

491
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,780
it's, I'll tell the story. It's a long story. I will not tell it today.

492
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:06,180
But yes,

493
00:21:06,189 --> 00:21:08,420
basically I got my service upgraded from 100 to

494
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,699
200 AMP for free and they buried my line

495
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,310
because basically

496
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:16,020
I, I live in an old neighborhood. They were sick of trees falling on the lines.

497
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:19,660
So they, they had, they had a deal I couldn't refuse.

498
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:25,439
That was actually a pretty short story. Anyway. Uh So putting that question now. OK.

499
00:21:25,449 --> 00:21:28,420
So, so this one was actually interesting, I think.

500
00:21:28,979 --> 00:21:30,689
No, no. Hang on here. It is. Uh

501
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:34,199
Right. So the whatsapp question was super interesting

502
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:38,640
when you look at the, the age demographics of the question because basically

503
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:41,959
anyone from the age of 50 plus

504
00:21:42,349 --> 00:21:43,670
like, had no idea.

505
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:48,969
And everyone 49 and below, for the most part knew this in terms of the breakdown. I'm

506
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:49,319
assuming

507
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:52,229
the 50 year olds don't use that app at all.

508
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:56,000
Right. Exactly. They're probably like, I don't even know what this is. That.

509
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,199
That's kind of my, my suspicion there as well.

510
00:21:58,209 --> 00:21:59,640
So I found that one interesting though.

511
00:21:59,979 --> 00:22:01,560
So. All right. Let's keep moving here.

512
00:22:01,569 --> 00:22:03,520
Now, here's another one that's depressing and says,

513
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:07,599
can identify examples of true two factor authentication.

514
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:14,869
-- 55% got it wrong. 28% got it right. 17% didn't know even my
-- bank gets it wrong.

515
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,589
They're like, I, I know you have a security question that's totally different.

516
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:20,010
And I'm like, no, it's, it's a password.

517
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,750
They're like, no, no, no, it's not a password. It's a security question.

518
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,040
I'm like, it's a hidden piece of data. I have to remember

519
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:28,410
that's a password. Like, no, no, totally separate security question

520
00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:29,410
also.

521
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:31,030
Can you tell us your mother's maiden name?

522
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:31,569
Right.

523
00:22:31,699 --> 00:22:34,310
I'm not shocked by this and I think it's depressing and

524
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:38,810
I blame places like banks for helping spread disinformation where they,

525
00:22:38,819 --> 00:22:40,250
they had me enter

526
00:22:40,469 --> 00:22:42,329
like my favorite one always was

527
00:22:42,979 --> 00:22:46,479
I, I don't even know if I still use this bank anymore. It was a long time ago

528
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:51,390
you enter your log in information and then it would show me a picture I had picked out

529
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:55,599
to prove it was them. And I'm like, this doesn't prove anything.

530
00:22:56,089 --> 00:22:58,709
And it was like, oh, my goodness, this is so ridiculous.

531
00:22:58,729 --> 00:23:02,969
-- I,
-- no, that was actually as a direct response to a common class of, like,

532
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:05,030
uh, web browser hijacking

533
00:23:05,189 --> 00:23:07,750
software that was popular a few years ago.

534
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,589
But the thing is that, that solves like one specific avenue of attack.

535
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,449
It doesn't actually give you strong to.

536
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:13,880
Yeah,

537
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:15,140
I picked,

538
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,510
oh, jeez, I think.

539
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,709
Yeah, they, I, I forget the one bank I deal with does used to do that and it was,

540
00:23:20,719 --> 00:23:23,819
I forget if I got to upload my own picture, I don't think I got to upload a picture.

541
00:23:23,829 --> 00:23:25,750
I think I had to choose from like 10 pictures

542
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:29,780
and it was like playing cards or something and other stupid stuff. And

543
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,319
yeah, I,

544
00:23:31,739 --> 00:23:36,510
yeah. No, it's, this is not proper two fa, I mean, it's technically two fa because

545
00:23:36,969 --> 00:23:38,880
no, it's not, it's not two factors.

546
00:23:39,349 --> 00:23:41,079
It is one factor, authentication.

547
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,030
Yeah.

548
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,550
Well, it's one type of factor

549
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:45,739
but just

550
00:23:46,579 --> 00:23:47,670
you're not helping.

551
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,810
This is the problem.

552
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,140
Well,

553
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,140
that is the problem is that people define two

554
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:55,199
fa is two factors but are they different factors?

555
00:23:55,209 --> 00:23:57,699
And that's where we, we never held them to account.

556
00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:01,010
I would punch you through the microphone right now

557
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:04,099
if I could stop putting technicalities on this question.

558
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:08,140
And this is, I think the problem with two factor off today is we keep saying, well,

559
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,699
actually when the reality is no, like

560
00:24:10,869 --> 00:24:14,410
you should be having a user name and password and get a freaking UBI key or something.

561
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,989
And that's what, that's how it needs to work.

562
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,780
Well, here's a great example is phone based two fa

563
00:24:20,109 --> 00:24:23,310
like something based on your phone number. Is that proper two fa or not?

564
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:24,189
Yes.

565
00:24:24,199 --> 00:24:28,050
And it is acceptable in most situations because I

566
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,270
-- believe
-- there's a question later in the thing that

567
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:34,390
I only knew who that person was because of something related to this.

568
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,709
Ok. We'll get, yeah, that one's coming up. Uh,

569
00:24:36,989 --> 00:24:39,219
we're not going to argue about if S MS

570
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:42,589
counts as two factor authentication because that is a,

571
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,180
a den of snakes

572
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,239
that

573
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,079
-- has no good end to it.
-- I think

574
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,579
that it is weak to fa

575
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,800
-- ok. I'll agree with that. Yes,
-- it is easily hijacked.

576
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:53,579
I'll agree with.

577
00:24:53,589 --> 00:24:55,099
It's not easy to hijack.

578
00:24:55,109 --> 00:24:58,640
It's, if you are a specific target, it can be used against you.

579
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,579
If you are a random person, you are fine.

580
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:01,839
That is

581
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:06,270
not the warning. A lot of it's, it's anyway,

582
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,089
I'm gonna do

583
00:25:07,199 --> 00:25:07,250
it.

584
00:25:07,369 --> 00:25:07,410
We're

585
00:25:07,709 --> 00:25:07,750
doing

586
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:08,560
it.

587
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:11,329
We're going to move on right next next. Uh Right.

588
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:14,469
So this one private browsing mode only prevents someone

589
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:17,859
using the same computer from seeing one's online activities.

590
00:25:17,869 --> 00:25:21,130
They suggested being like your ISP still knows what you're looking at.

591
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,839
Whereas the person living with you may not,

592
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,140
I would say private browsing attempts to do that.

593
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,319
I'm not sure that it actually accomplishes it.

594
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:31,310
Whatever, man, it does it for most people.

595
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:31,530
If,

596
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:34,209
if I'm using your computer with a private browser on

597
00:25:34,219 --> 00:25:36,540
and then you walk in and I quick close it,

598
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:37,689
I'm probably fine.

599
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:37,989
Well,

600
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,890
-- unless I have some other software running to monitor which you
-- probably don't,

601
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:43,050
it's fine. Everything's fine.

602
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:46,209
Whatever. See, again, you're getting into these ridiculous technicalities.

603
00:25:46,219 --> 00:25:48,939
Normal people don't have monitoring software.

604
00:25:48,949 --> 00:25:52,270
-- Parents
-- generally do with their kids computers and

605
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,459
maybe they do.

606
00:25:53,489 --> 00:25:57,439
Maybe they don't, please don't spy on your kids. I don't think it breeds trust.

607
00:25:57,449 --> 00:25:59,140
It's not that I want to spy on my kids.

608
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,500
I actually really don't want, I don't have time for that,

609
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,280
but more to the point I do want to block.

610
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:06,479
Like, for example, I would like to give my kids access to Wikipedia,

611
00:26:06,489 --> 00:26:09,239
but there's definitely a couple of pages in Wikipedia that

612
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:12,430
maybe at the age of eight, they're not quite ready for yet,

613
00:26:14,479 --> 00:26:15,130
you know.

614
00:26:16,099 --> 00:26:19,319
Uh I'm not, I could make so many jokes right now and I won't.

615
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:25,119
So, ok, so private browsing mode, 25% got it wrong. 24% got it right. 49% don't know.

616
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,920
And I feel like that is a completely expected distribution.

617
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:31,239
-- I
-- think that don't know, is actually in a way

618
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,229
good in that these, well,

619
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:36,380
at least for the purposes of the survey they're willing to say, I don't know,

620
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:37,800
but my question

621
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:40,439
or concern would be that in real life, what do they

622
00:26:40,545 --> 00:26:42,295
-- do?
-- Or maybe they do know.

623
00:26:42,305 --> 00:26:45,535
And they're just being cool because their partners next to them, like private

624
00:26:45,974 --> 00:26:49,525
browsing. What does that do? I don't know what would look at with private browsing.

625
00:26:49,535 --> 00:26:50,525
I don't know.

626
00:26:51,175 --> 00:26:55,224
Like this weekend I fixed a friend's laptop and I, well, I don't know that I fixed it.

627
00:26:55,234 --> 00:26:58,994
I made it less worse for sure. Like it booted up and then the web browser

628
00:26:59,145 --> 00:27:03,125
just didn't even get the sad dinosaur. Internet broken

629
00:27:03,334 --> 00:27:04,885
screen. It just did not work.

630
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:08,959
And so I finally, you know, at first I was like, ok, and I made a recovery,

631
00:27:09,089 --> 00:27:09,699
um,

632
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,560
antivirus scanner stick and scan the machine.

633
00:27:12,569 --> 00:27:14,739
I'm like, oh, no, it's, it's actually clean. Like, what the heck.

634
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,719
And then I started poking around. I was like, oh, you got Komodo and it's out of date?

635
00:27:17,729 --> 00:27:21,239
Ok. Get rid of Komodo. Hard reboot. Hey, she works again.

636
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,270
And, you know, and it was funny because this guy is like, oh, yeah,

637
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,260
I'd meant to get rid of Komodo.

638
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:29,540
-- I just hadn't gotten around to it yet
-- for the last seven years.

639
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:33,819
It's been more like a month or two, but it had been apparently completely hosed

640
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,219
and,

641
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,729
you know, they have another computer that does work.

642
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:40,089
-- So, hey,
-- is it called a chromebook or

643
00:27:40,739 --> 00:27:41,459
no? But,

644
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:45,579
so, I mean, that's, that's my fear is there's oftentimes people will,

645
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,640
if you ask them, they'll say, I don't know.

646
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,859
But if they're actually in that situation,

647
00:27:50,459 --> 00:27:50,959
uh,

648
00:27:51,689 --> 00:27:53,489
it's not that they won't say they don't know.

649
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,800
But by definition, if you don't know, where do you even begin to look?

650
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:00,030
What words do I type into my browser to learn about this?

651
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,280
-- No. Really?
-- Right.

652
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:02,760
There's,

653
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:05,819
they could rename it to something more inappropriate

654
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:06,760
but

655
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:11,910
private browsing. Ok. The Wikipedia pages front and center.

656
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,150
That's actually not bad.

657
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:16,140
Ok. Ok. Well, whatever, whatever

658
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,140
I will say though, from the professional perspective,

659
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,709
I love having private browsing because I can open a window that

660
00:28:21,719 --> 00:28:24,930
doesn't have any of the cookies that are in my other windows.

661
00:28:24,939 --> 00:28:26,430
So I can, like,

662
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:29,510
look at a site as if I was not someone logged into

663
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,189
like every freaking service on the planet in my web browser,

664
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:32,829
which is nice.

665
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:33,349
I like that

666
00:28:33,449 --> 00:28:34,310
anyway. All right.

667
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,380
And here it is

668
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:36,599
the question.

669
00:28:36,689 --> 00:28:38,439
The one that you didn't know either,

670
00:28:38,449 --> 00:28:41,920
can they correctly identify a picture of Jack Dorsey?

671
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:46,900
7% got it wrong. 15% got it right. And 77% didn't know.

672
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:49,729
So, wait, wait, wait, I thought the question was who is Jack Dorsey?

673
00:28:49,739 --> 00:28:53,719
Because I was like, I know he's a tech leader CEO or something.

674
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:55,959
But like, I have no idea what he looks like.

675
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:57,719
Well, that's the beauty of Jack Dorsey.

676
00:28:57,729 --> 00:28:58,770
His, his pictures,

677
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:03,780
as I told you in Slack earlier is they kind of range from pimply faced youth in his

678
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:08,250
younger days to star Trek villain to a guy who probably should own a nightclub in L a,

679
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,869
like, he has this incredibly different

680
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:13,260
-- kind of range of photos of him.
-- Yeah.

681
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:18,050
I'm just, I, I just googled it and number one, he wears a lot of black so he's, I guess,

682
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,680
Channel Tim Cook or whatever.

683
00:29:19,689 --> 00:29:23,300
I, a lot of this seems to depend on when he last had his beard and hair trimmed

684
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:23,750
in.

685
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:25,599
-- Exactly,
-- because it goes from, like,

686
00:29:25,609 --> 00:29:28,979
straight up homeless to billionaire in the space.

687
00:29:29,489 --> 00:29:30,439
Exactly.

688
00:29:30,689 --> 00:29:32,349
Exactly. So, I don't,

689
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,510
I feel like if someone showed me a random picture of Jack Dorsey,

690
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,319
there's probably a very high probability.

691
00:29:37,329 --> 00:29:39,069
I would say, I have no idea who that person is.

692
00:29:39,619 --> 00:29:42,859
And so, but why, what is the purpose of that, this question?

693
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,939
And I'm looking at this like,

694
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:46,270
and then he's shaved and he looks totally different as most men

695
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,859
do when they shave their beard off and cut their hair.

696
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,160
I don't,

697
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:54,359
I don't know why they asked this and I even read in their explanations and like,

698
00:29:54,369 --> 00:29:56,290
there doesn't seem to be a purpose behind it.

699
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,050
And my, my, the only thing I can figure is

700
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:01,890
you figure api bet a picture of Mark Zuckerberg

701
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,130
would have a much, much higher

702
00:30:04,239 --> 00:30:08,280
-- success rate of people identify.
-- Well, he's got that very infamous robotic look to

703
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:13,040
-- him.
-- He, he does, right. The android manufacturers hadn't gotten it right yet.

704
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:16,400
-- You
-- know, the whole I am a human too and enjoy waffle.

705
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:18,650
Yes. Exactly. Exactly.

706
00:30:18,699 --> 00:30:21,219
Smile at exe right now you could ask about,

707
00:30:21,229 --> 00:30:23,550
say one of the Google founders and I think they would

708
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,959
be even less well known than Jack Dorsey in most instances.

709
00:30:27,469 --> 00:30:31,380
But I, I don't know, I don't, what, what, what does this prove?

710
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,290
I just looked up a picture of Sergey Brin.

711
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,229
-- He looks totally different than he did 20 years ago.
-- I believe it.

712
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:38,500
I don't think I've seen a picture of him in 20 years

713
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:41,020
and so I'm confident I would have no idea who he is.

714
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:43,250
It's honestly generic white guy.

715
00:30:43,949 --> 00:30:47,339
That's it. No, that's all, that's all I can say straight up. Like, uh,

716
00:30:47,989 --> 00:30:49,439
maybe I don't,

717
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:54,060
II, I don't know what to say. I really don't know what to say about this one.

718
00:30:54,069 --> 00:30:54,770
I think, uh,

719
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:58,010
I think the only time that question is kind of fair is around something like saying,

720
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,550
maybe the queen of England, especially if you live in

721
00:31:00,979 --> 00:31:03,800
a country where she's on every single piece of money.

722
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:06,979
You know, then, then that's an interesting statistical point because it's like,

723
00:31:06,989 --> 00:31:07,180
wait,

724
00:31:07,189 --> 00:31:08,689
how do you not know what the queen looks like if

725
00:31:08,699 --> 00:31:10,880
she's on every single piece of money you've ever handled?

726
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:13,630
-- But
-- do you only have pictures of the current queen or

727
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,199
do you have young queen on some of your money?

728
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:18,969
-- What depends on how old the money is?
-- Ah, so it's conceivable.

729
00:31:18,979 --> 00:31:20,689
Someone could be looking at an old coin.

730
00:31:20,699 --> 00:31:25,319
I believe there's about four or five different pictures currently in use.

731
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:27,660
Well, in in common use in the sense of like,

732
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,390
you know, currency, like there's bills or, well, more, well,

733
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,109
not really bills anymore.

734
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:32,579
We got rid of all the paper money but, um,

735
00:31:32,589 --> 00:31:36,180
coins that are older and floating around with the younger pictures of her.

736
00:31:36,189 --> 00:31:38,689
But, yeah, like who I, I think maybe, um,

737
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:42,079
well, I'm just, yeah, I don't understand the point of that question at all.

738
00:31:42,089 --> 00:31:45,739
I don't get it and I feel like that is exactly what I would expect.

739
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:49,119
I, I'm kind of surprised that anything above single digits could identify him,

740
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:49,839
to be honest.

741
00:31:51,849 --> 00:31:53,619
Right. Right. Yeah.

742
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:57,300
Yeah. I, I don't know. I don't understand that question in any way.

743
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:58,300
Whatever.

744
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:01,400
I mean, it makes sense for an actor. Like, you know, here's a picture of Keanu Reeves.

745
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:04,260
Do you know who that is? And if they say no, it's kind of like, seriously, like, but

746
00:32:04,939 --> 00:32:05,609
I

747
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,619
watch TV.

748
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,099
I, I could fall in that trap.

749
00:32:09,109 --> 00:32:11,140
I don't know a lot of actors and I don't

750
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:13,750
care because I basically don't like to watch movies.

751
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,219
So I don't know, very like Keanu Reeves.

752
00:32:16,229 --> 00:32:18,390
I know just because he's been in so much sci fi stuff. But

753
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,780
he is, he's awesome.

754
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:25,619
Uh, actually, you know what? I, I rewatched Johnny Mnemonic the other day. Holy cow.

755
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,040
That movie is still awesome.

756
00:32:27,219 --> 00:32:28,339
It's, it's funny

757
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:31,890
because they talk about what he has, like 300 terabytes in his head and they're like,

758
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,010
oh, there's so much data like,

759
00:32:33,209 --> 00:32:33,270
ha ha.

760
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,380
-- That's
-- nothing. Yeah, 300 gigabytes

761
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:38,680
-- with a ra M doubler or
-- 300 gigabytes. Thank you. Right.

762
00:32:38,689 --> 00:32:40,859
I'm like, ah, that's barely any but

763
00:32:41,689 --> 00:32:45,060
it's like, yes, the key, my key chain in my pocket has more data.

764
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:46,709
But anyway, it holds up.

765
00:32:46,719 --> 00:32:47,819
But anyway, yeah, there's,

766
00:32:47,829 --> 00:32:51,670
there's tons of Hollywood people that I would have no idea who they are.

767
00:32:51,699 --> 00:32:55,520
So, I, I don't know, but I feel like Jack, whatever, whatever it doesn't matter.

768
00:32:55,699 --> 00:32:58,540
I think an interesting question would have been like, have you ever, have you,

769
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:01,719
you know, have you ever used Twitter for more than five minutes?

770
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:03,060
And I suspect again there would be like

771
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:03,199
a

772
00:33:03,689 --> 00:33:07,800
-- cliff of a drop at 40 or 50 probably.
-- Yeah. Right.

773
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,810
Because I mean, I'll never forget I had, someone

774
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:13,680
will say an older person one time asked me is Twitter hard.

775
00:33:13,689 --> 00:33:16,079
I'm like, oh, no, is tweeting hard is what they said.

776
00:33:16,089 --> 00:33:19,729
I'm like, I can't answer you just stop talking to me.

777
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:23,900
Like I don't, if, if I answer your question, I'm going to end up in a discussion.

778
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:24,630
I don't want,

779
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,319
I think philosophically the person who asked that question,

780
00:33:28,329 --> 00:33:30,540
-- the answer is unfortunately,
-- yes.

781
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,260
No, Kurt, that's not the intent of the question that was asked.

782
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,859
And this again is my security gets into

783
00:33:34,869 --> 00:33:36,660
trouble because instead of answering their question,

784
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:37,380
you go on

785
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:41,650
some ridiculous philosophical tangent that nobody cares

786
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,459
about the person was asking like,

787
00:33:43,469 --> 00:33:45,239
what do I have to do to tweet and the answer

788
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,339
is install the app and type crap into that box.

789
00:33:47,349 --> 00:33:48,369
But no,

790
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:50,819
it's not a philosophical question

791
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,010
anyway. Anyway. So I guess

792
00:33:53,209 --> 00:33:56,380
I look at these survey results and

793
00:33:56,550 --> 00:34:00,160
the, my, my main takeaway is that I feel like

794
00:34:01,189 --> 00:34:03,729
we live in a different world than everyone else

795
00:34:03,739 --> 00:34:06,589
because we're very aware of all of these technologies,

796
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:07,890
we know how a lot of them work.

797
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,679
And so

798
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,370
while we would have gotten almost all these questions, right?

799
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,649
It is

800
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:15,168
understandable. Most people don't.

801
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:18,489
And I don't know if that's, I would like to say it's a bad thing,

802
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,989
-- but maybe it's not,
-- I don't think it is.

803
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,179
I mean, I, I go back to electricity, for example,

804
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:26,560
almost nobody really understands how electricity works.

805
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,389
And I'm going to put you in that category too because

806
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,649
like explain magnetism to me in 10 words or less,

807
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:32,280
nobody can explain magnetism.

808
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:35,399
If you, if you, if you understand how magnetism works, you,

809
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:37,399
you won't answer that question because you can't.

810
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,199
It's like, actually,

811
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,370
did you ever see the question where the reporter asked

812
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:42,610
Richard Feynman that and he basically goes off in this crazy

813
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,780
rant and says, I can't answer your question for you.

814
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:46,449
It's beautiful. It's beautiful.

815
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:48,688
-- But
-- more to the point as long as you follow the,

816
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:51,090
you have an electrician who follows the electrical code,

817
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:53,239
who cares? You plug stuff in it works

818
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,399
well. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you for listening.

Thanks everyone. Bye bye.
