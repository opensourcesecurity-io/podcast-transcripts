Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,819 --> 00:00:11,390
Kurt Siefried and my partner clicking on random stuff.

2
00:00:11,399 --> 00:00:16,690
Josh Pressers. It wasn't a click. You had to scan a QR code. So did you scan it? Yeah.

3
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,239
And then you have to tap on it. Did you scan it? I scan QR codes all the time.

4
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:22,149
But did you scan the QR code?

5
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,139
Which? Oh, you mean the one from the Super Bowl? I

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,709
don't watch TV. Does Canada get the Super Bowl? I don't know if you pay for it.

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,110
Oh, it's not like just broadcast. I don't know these things. It's,

8
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,630
I'm also not a football fan.

9
00:00:35,919 --> 00:00:38,580
Well, neither am I but the commercials are funny.

10
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,689
All right. So let's explain

11
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,650
what just happened.

12
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:47,970
So what the latest championship of which owl is the most superb,

13
00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:51,090
the world championship I might add of American football,

14
00:00:51,099 --> 00:00:52,409
which is also the wrong thing.

15
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:55,360
Well, it is American football. You're right. Sorry,

16
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,750
you got it right. Sorry, I'm supposed to talk about the commercials.

17
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:02,229
I've never seen the damn thing. Whatever. No, the QR code. What was the QR code?

18
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:02,599
You're not.

19
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:04,669
No, you're cut off. I'm telling the story.

20
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:04,779
I

21
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:04,980
didn't

22
00:01:05,169 --> 00:01:05,190
see

23
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:05,639
it.

24
00:01:06,059 --> 00:01:06,269
I read

25
00:01:06,379 --> 00:01:06,400
on

26
00:01:06,589 --> 00:01:06,709
Twitter.

27
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,720
So, in the United States, for anyone who doesn't know

28
00:01:10,919 --> 00:01:13,930
there is American football and the, like,

29
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,680
the championship for American football is called the Super Bowl and it's

30
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,139
held on a Sunday and a lot of people watch it.

31
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,040
I usually watch it because the commercials are funny.

32
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:25,419
I usually don't care about the game happening at all and I didn't this time either.

33
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,339
Uh, we eat a lot of terrible foods because it's fun.

34
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:30,220
And that's, that's pretty much it.

35
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:33,540
Well, and I forgot that we don't get the good commercials up here. Oh, really?

36
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,069
Oh, you have like knockoff Canada commercials basically. Yeah, people pay

37
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,059
for their commercials.

38
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:42,930
So we don't see commercials for like, Comcast and stuff, which we can't buy up here.

39
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,330
Thank God.

40
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:48,459
Anyway, we'll, we'll talk later. I, we can maybe make that work. But anyway, anyway,

41
00:01:48,699 --> 00:01:51,050
the Super Bowl has all these commercials and

42
00:01:51,169 --> 00:01:55,129
there is a commercial that's just a QR code bouncing around the screen, like,

43
00:01:55,139 --> 00:01:59,019
you know, those DVD player screens where like the little DVD logo bounces around

44
00:01:59,379 --> 00:01:59,589
that

45
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,860
because I was like, looking at the screenshot and I'm like,

46
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,949
what? Like I didn't under, ok.

47
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,680
Yeah. And it looked like that. Right?

48
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:10,899
And it's a QR code and the thing comes on and I just said, I bet that's a crypto

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,509
ad. And then my son says the QR code goes to Coinbase and I'm like, called it and then

50
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,960
security Twitter lost its mind.

51
00:02:19,089 --> 00:02:20,119
And that's the story

52
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:24,330
like, because obviously scanning QR codes is dangerous and it could get you pump.

53
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,059
I mean,

54
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,020
no, it can't. Like here's the thing,

55
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:32,440
the whole premise of pretty much every

56
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:34,779
modern compute device that people interact with

57
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,139
is that you, like you click on links and look at stuff,

58
00:02:38,649 --> 00:02:39,089
I mean.

59
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:42,970
Right. Like, especially in a web browser. That's kind of a thing I heard since.

60
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:47,820
Oh, I don't know, 9998 don't click on links in untrusted emails, right?

61
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,139
Good advice.

62
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,770
Or don't open emails from untrusted sources.

63
00:02:51,779 --> 00:02:54,539
It's like, but until I open the email, I can't see

64
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,869
my job is reading emails from people. Oh, no. How do I do?

65
00:02:59,089 --> 00:02:59,960
Ok. Ok.

66
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,000
Before we go all full on old man complaining mode here,

67
00:03:04,529 --> 00:03:07,369
I want to start by saying

68
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,460
this was a brilliant ad

69
00:03:09,779 --> 00:03:11,929
on behalf of Coinbase no matter what you think of crypto,

70
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,899
no matter what you think of Coinbase, didn't there site crash?

71
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,539
There's site crash because so many people visited the link

72
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,559
and we're all talking about it.

73
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,000
Like we're,

74
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:22,919
we're making a whole podcast about this one ad which

75
00:03:22,929 --> 00:03:26,559
is good job marketing team like you did it.

76
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,880
Well, I hope you get a nice bonus.

77
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:31,470
It's one of those sort of if you do the minimalist

78
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,559
thing and you're the only person doing the minimalist thing.

79
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,479
It really stands out.

80
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,839
Like my favorite example of this is Apple stores and apple packaging.

81
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:42,389
Right. There's a really great youtube video of like taking an apple product in a box

82
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:47,050
and like, basically turning it into what, like Microsoft would put on that box.

83
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:49,710
Right. And it's just like tons of text and pictures and it's just,

84
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:52,990
it's, it's a horror show. It's like clip art threw up on the box

85
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,449
and, but that's the thing. Like, so,

86
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:58,229
uh, I think I've talked about this before. But locally at the West

87
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,169
Monton Mall, there is an Apple store and it's, it's an Apple store,

88
00:04:01,179 --> 00:04:01,750
you know what it is.

89
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,679
And there's, there was past tense,

90
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,000
a Microsoft store and it was comical in that the

91
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:10,850
Microsoft store clearly tried to copy the Apple store,

92
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,369
but Barfed Microsoft all over it.

93
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,640
And so like the walls instead of being calm were

94
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:19,000
like video displays with crap on them all the time.

95
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:23,410
And I remember I literally walked in there once just to see what would happen and try.

96
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,089
And I'm like, hey,

97
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,130
I'm actually looking for a windows computer.

98
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:29,390
This is back when I was all max no Windows.

99
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,049
And

100
00:04:30,529 --> 00:04:35,019
I want a Windows computer kind of like an IMAC format with a touchscreen, you know,

101
00:04:35,029 --> 00:04:37,859
kind of an all in one touchscreen that my kids can easily use.

102
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,239
And I want multitouch

103
00:04:40,369 --> 00:04:43,029
and he started looking at and telling me about the

104
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,829
different CP US and amounts of ra M they had,

105
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:45,910
I mean,

106
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,890
and like as a technical person I'm like, I don't, I don't care, they're all fast.

107
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:51,589
I don't care,

108
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,510
doesn't have multitouch

109
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,640
and he didn't know and he couldn't answer. And it's like,

110
00:04:55,779 --> 00:05:00,220
you know, and it's just the whole experience was so hysterically Microsoft

111
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:03,809
and, and that's how I feel like, so this, this minimalist ad is brilliant because,

112
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,290
yeah, it's,

113
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:06,850
it's just a moment of calm with a QR Code.

114
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:10,290
It's not a moment of calm at all. Everyone lost their minds.

115
00:05:10,299 --> 00:05:14,660
Now here is where I think it's really funny is there's a QR code.

116
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,950
A bunch of people on Infosec Twitter are complaining about don't,

117
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:20,549
don't scan random QR codes because your phone can get

118
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:23,630
POed and your dog will get kidnapped or whatever.

119
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:25,380
But here's the thing if you were paying

120
00:05:25,545 --> 00:05:28,234
attention to the Super Bowl prior to that ad,

121
00:05:28,434 --> 00:05:32,975
I bet there were no less than 20 QR codes that appeared in various other places,

122
00:05:32,984 --> 00:05:34,125
other commercials

123
00:05:34,255 --> 00:05:38,095
on the screen is just in the background of the game and kind of crap like that.

124
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:40,695
But this is the one everyone loses their mind over.

125
00:05:40,804 --> 00:05:43,575
Here's the two things that boils down to for me. Number one,

126
00:05:43,894 --> 00:05:45,635
it is safe to click a QR code.

127
00:05:45,864 --> 00:05:47,274
If it's not safe to click,

128
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,174
click it, you got to scan it, man.

129
00:05:49,184 --> 00:05:52,234
Come on, you scan it and click it whatever you're young and hip.

130
00:05:52,424 --> 00:05:53,054
I'm not,

131
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:57,119
I I am hip and that they pop when I get off the couch. But um

132
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:01,839
so here's the thing if, if clicking a link or scanning a QR code or, or some

133
00:06:02,049 --> 00:06:04,059
to put it bluntly, if some

134
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,359
interaction of your web browser and a web server is dangerous,

135
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,390
then your web browser is broken. I agree.

136
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,640
Like it has a zero day or it's so out of date, it's a problem, right?

137
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:16,279
Number one and number two,

138
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,040
if you go to a website

139
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:22,959
and you, it's like not your bank for sure or not something that, you know, for sure.

140
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:24,950
And you start plugging all your personal information

141
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,660
into it without kind of a second thought

142
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:27,329
then.

143
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:29,890
Well, yeah, kind of sucks to you. Like one story.

144
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:31,170
I just actually going through this,

145
00:06:31,179 --> 00:06:33,920
uh Alberta Treasure branch is a bank I actually use

146
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:35,230
here in Alberta

147
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,239
and they have like,

148
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,529
apparently a sort of think tank venture cap kind of technology arm

149
00:06:39,989 --> 00:06:41,380
and I got a piece of like,

150
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,690
spam because apparently I think from the show we're on some marketing list now.

151
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,179
Hey, like, are you getting this stuff too?

152
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:49,299
I get so much junk. It's not even funny.

153
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,320
Ok. Yeah, because I've been getting a ton of weird stuff, especially blocked

154
00:06:52,429 --> 00:06:55,089
anyways. And it's an identity provider. Kind of like that one the IRS

155
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,250
using

156
00:06:55,429 --> 00:06:59,100
with the face scanning. I forget what the name was. Something dot ID. Do me. Yeah.

157
00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:03,959
And this one was some random four letter combination dot ID.

158
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,850
So Indonesia dot id though. Clever.

159
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:06,940
And I'm like, ok, cool.

160
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,709
And I replied to the press release saying, yeah, I'm kind of interested in this but,

161
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:10,380
but

162
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,640
I, I need basically proof that this is from Alberta Treasure Branch like that.

163
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:15,380
This is actually

164
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:18,929
because the person emailing me is from some random media company

165
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,940
and she doesn't know what I'm talking about. So it's,

166
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:23,170
I love that you have this website talking about

167
00:07:23,179 --> 00:07:25,640
identity management and like giving us all your information.

168
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,220
And as best I can tell,

169
00:07:27,609 --> 00:07:30,010
the only mention I could find that it's related at

170
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:31,920
all to Canada is that in their terms of use,

171
00:07:31,929 --> 00:07:34,920
they say if you go to court with them that it will be in Calgary, Alberta, which is

172
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,920
where A TB is located out of.

173
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:37,799
Right? OK.

174
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:40,200
But there's no like contact us page.

175
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:40,559
There's,

176
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,309
they don't have an entry and done in Brad Street because it's not like a company.

177
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,350
It's like AAA

178
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:49,070
some sort of effort from a TB. That's not like a fully separate company yet.

179
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:51,190
And it's so it's supposed to be this identity

180
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,640
provider that can't prove to you who it is.

181
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:57,989
Yes. Exactly. Right. I find it very funny

182
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:58,600
and,

183
00:07:58,779 --> 00:07:59,000
and

184
00:07:59,459 --> 00:07:59,850
so like,

185
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:01,709
am I gonna give this site my info so I can have like

186
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,660
a self sovereign digital Blockchain based identity with the A TB blah,

187
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:05,269
blah, blah thing.

188
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:05,390
A

189
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:05,559
lot

190
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,170
of words. Exactly. It's word soup. But that's the thing is normal.

191
00:08:09,179 --> 00:08:10,920
People would look at that and go oh yeah, it looks legit.

192
00:08:10,929 --> 00:08:13,190
It says it's associated with a TB.

193
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,989
It probably is. Oh, it's absolutely legit.

194
00:08:17,489 --> 00:08:18,200
I can't prove it.

195
00:08:18,429 --> 00:08:21,089
I mean, but how much can you prove? Look? OK, simple.

196
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,763
They could have a page on the ETB website saying here is this thing,

197
00:08:24,773 --> 00:08:26,822
this is not going in the direction I expected

198
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,903
this conversation to which I think is fine.

199
00:08:28,972 --> 00:08:32,121
But I think, look, if you look at how

200
00:08:32,472 --> 00:08:36,552
modern society function, even society for probably the last couple of 100 years

201
00:08:36,732 --> 00:08:41,263
is there is an enormous amount of just implied trust

202
00:08:41,332 --> 00:08:44,442
everywhere we look when a police officer pulls you over,

203
00:08:44,703 --> 00:08:46,703
how does he prove he's a police officer,

204
00:08:46,882 --> 00:08:47,953
you know, call 911.

205
00:08:48,192 --> 00:08:49,663
Well, you can but no one does.

206
00:08:50,276 --> 00:08:50,445
Well,

207
00:08:50,455 --> 00:08:51,955
they do now locally a bit because there were some

208
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:54,505
people Impersonating police officers pulling women over on the freeway.

209
00:08:54,515 --> 00:08:54,895
So like

210
00:08:55,015 --> 00:08:57,726
that, I mean, that's an example where there was a solution but like that,

211
00:08:57,736 --> 00:08:59,185
that's terrible, obviously.

212
00:08:59,195 --> 00:09:02,765
But you know what I mean? There's so many things that happen. If we had to

213
00:09:02,966 --> 00:09:05,726
go out of our way to verify trust with

214
00:09:05,736 --> 00:09:08,556
every interaction we we have throughout our day,

215
00:09:08,606 --> 00:09:10,455
we would accomplish nothing

216
00:09:10,685 --> 00:09:13,666
well, even better. So I just saw this on the CBC marketplace.

217
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:16,825
You know what you have to do to register a lien on a property here in Canada.

218
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:18,900
And I bet it's comically simple.

219
00:09:18,909 --> 00:09:22,799
You go to a website and you say that you want to register a lien on it and,

220
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:26,000
but you have a commercial interest on it and you fill out a little form and click.

221
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:26,460
Yes.

222
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,609
I'm not even a little surprised.

223
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,320
And for the person on the receiving end of that lien,

224
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:32,500
they are hooped

225
00:09:32,869 --> 00:09:33,500
if it's,

226
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:34,390
you know what I mean?

227
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,690
Because, yeah, everybody's discovering that when you like rent a furnace or,

228
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,380
you know, have a security system installed that you pay for monthly,

229
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,729
they put a lien on your house to make sure you pay for it.

230
00:09:43,739 --> 00:09:44,979
So you don't like sell the house and

231
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,969
the bill doesn't get paid, right? Which is fair. But

232
00:09:48,729 --> 00:09:51,190
the people don't realize the lien is being registered

233
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,169
and also the amounts of the lien are like,

234
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:54,530
pretty crazy in some cases,

235
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,210
you know, like $20,000 on a $5000 water tank or whatever.

236
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:01,000
But anyway, you, you get my point right?

237
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:04,000
Like this is we, we're off in the weeds, but fundamentally,

238
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:08,049
there's just all this implied trust that has to exist and I think it's no different.

239
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,130
Well, because it usually doesn't get abused.

240
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,710
Well, it, it usually doesn't.

241
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:15,390
And I think like this Coinbase thing is another example of it didn't get abused.

242
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,070
There was nothing wrong with the QR code.

243
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,919
Well, the other thing, people forget QR Codes often have a context.

244
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:22,299
Like I sit down at a restaurant,

245
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:25,830
there's a QR code like taped to the table and they're like,

246
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,390
scan that to get the the menu,

247
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:28,349
like, and

248
00:10:28,489 --> 00:10:30,039
they don't even have to tell me anymore because I'm,

249
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:33,580
I'm pretty sure if I see a QR code taped to a table in a restaurant,

250
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,270
it's probably the menu.

251
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:40,140
So we just need to start taping QR codes to tables at restaurants

252
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:43,219
that send you to the Rickroll web page.

253
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,109
And that already happened with the parking thing.

254
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:49,840
Remember where, uh, the, the, some place in the US has like QR codes where

255
00:10:50,015 --> 00:10:52,354
you scan and go to, you know, pay or whatever

256
00:10:52,645 --> 00:10:55,395
and somebody replaced those QR codes. And so people were

257
00:10:55,585 --> 00:10:57,635
paying somebody else for parking, you

258
00:10:58,284 --> 00:10:58,364
know.

259
00:10:58,614 --> 00:10:59,984
Interesting. So,

260
00:11:00,174 --> 00:11:02,614
and so like what they do here locally is they just have signs and the,

261
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:07,734
the sign has a number like you're in zone 2004 or 1968 or whatever inherently,

262
00:11:07,744 --> 00:11:09,775
trusting a QR code in public.

263
00:11:09,844 --> 00:11:12,155
Yeah, they're pretty easy to swap over cover with a sticker

264
00:11:12,445 --> 00:11:15,195
and again, it kind of boils down to,

265
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,429
well, this is why, I mean, this is one of the biggest reasons TLS exists is

266
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:20,840
not to encrypt your connection,

267
00:11:20,849 --> 00:11:24,359
but to have a certificate that says you're actually at walmart.com,

268
00:11:24,369 --> 00:11:28,479
not walmart.com, but like Walmart with one l.com,

269
00:11:28,489 --> 00:11:32,169
you don't check the certificate and no one really checks the

270
00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:36,460
URL bar that closely and anyone can get a certificate now.

271
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,159
Well, for any website. But yeah, so,

272
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,140
so I wanna,

273
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:43,940
I wanna realist all the way back now because this conversation has gone

274
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,770
off into a weird place to a tweet you put on the internet.

275
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,239
I put on the internet. Don't? I sound like an old person today

276
00:11:51,369 --> 00:11:57,450
that basically points out a bunch of just bad security advice that won't die.

277
00:11:57,619 --> 00:12:02,140
And one of them is, don't scan QR codes. Why don't you tell us what the others are?

278
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,419
Let's see if you remember. Uh,

279
00:12:03,549 --> 00:12:04,809
so the one was, I originally,

280
00:12:04,905 --> 00:12:07,955
they said password length when I meant password complexity.

281
00:12:07,965 --> 00:12:08,174
Close

282
00:12:08,455 --> 00:12:11,385
enough. Well, no password length is great. Password complexity is stupid.

283
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:12,044
We know

284
00:12:12,155 --> 00:12:15,835
what you mean? Clicking on links slash scanning QR codes.

285
00:12:16,215 --> 00:12:17,885
And then the other one which I just,

286
00:12:17,895 --> 00:12:20,924
I want to always eye gouge people is don't use public Wi

287
00:12:21,044 --> 00:12:21,375
Fi.

288
00:12:21,739 --> 00:12:23,760
That's right. That's right. And I agree. Yeah,

289
00:12:23,969 --> 00:12:27,510
I live in Canada. Do you know what I pay for data? I don't, I know it.

290
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:33,599
I have to use public Wi Fi. It's, it's a lot like I, I have unlimited free data.

291
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:36,280
I could do whatever I want. I can buy unlimited data

292
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:40,099
except when you get to eight gigs, they cap you to like 256 K percent. It's

293
00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:42,640
not unlimited data. No, it's unlimited

294
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:43,760
time use.

295
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:44,520
I,

296
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:44,849
I

297
00:12:44,969 --> 00:12:49,539
swear this is the argument they made, especially also with the, um,

298
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:53,940
with all the cable modems and stuff was that it's, you're allowed to be on 24 7.

299
00:12:54,049 --> 00:12:54,150
What,

300
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:54,440
what

301
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:55,440
do you mean?

302
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,380
It's unlimited, you can be on 24 7.

303
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:00,020
But that was their definition of unlimited, not unlimited.

304
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:04,760
When they said unlimited use, you can use it 24 7. Not unlimited data. Like, holy cow.

305
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,710
That's some grade a weasel right there

306
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:08,390
again.

307
00:13:08,849 --> 00:13:10,739
Like, as a Canadian, I can probably say,

308
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,599
I hate all the internet and data related companies up here and

309
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:15,679
I'm pretty sure every Canadian is going to be like, uh huh.

310
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,260
Yeah, it's, it's hard to have worse cell service than the US.

311
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:23,760
But like, Canada pulled out all the stops on this one. So well done. Canada.

312
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,619
Ok. Anyway, anyway,

313
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,650
bad security advice. So you asked the question, why doesn't this stuff die?

314
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:33,940
And I've been thinking about this since you put that tweet up? Because

315
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,059
I think that's a valid question. There's,

316
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:37,580
and there's a ton of stuff.

317
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:41,859
It's not just these three, the thing I keep thinking of is there's kind of,

318
00:13:41,869 --> 00:13:43,580
I think two aspects to this.

319
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,169
There is the security people who spout this nonsense.

320
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,479
And I think

321
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,729
some of it is they, they, they've let their skill set wane.

322
00:13:52,789 --> 00:13:54,919
They haven't maybe kept up with the modern knowledge.

323
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:57,830
But then there's also the other side is the people, like,

324
00:13:58,289 --> 00:14:02,940
we hammered this into their brains for so long

325
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:07,580
that I don't know if we can undo the damage at this point.

326
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:10,789
You know, the thing I was thinking about, it's like, why, why is that advice?

327
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:12,020
Bad and advice?

328
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:12,159
Like,

329
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:13,650
always look both ways when you cross the street

330
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:17,440
is good because that's a timeless piece of advice.

331
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:18,690
But I think part of it is

332
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:20,179
the downside of all

333
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:21,690
looking both ways. When you cross the road,

334
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,380
you don't have an opportunity cost, you don't lose something.

335
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:27,859
Whereas if you don't use public wi fi or you don't open emails from strangers,

336
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:30,880
you lose something, especially for example, if you're in sales, like,

337
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:33,140
if you're in sales and you don't open emails from strangers,

338
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,520
but you're not going to be in sales for very long.

339
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:36,739
Yeah, exactly. Right.

340
00:14:37,099 --> 00:14:37,760
And

341
00:14:37,929 --> 00:14:39,559
you know, like I remember, oh my God,

342
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,070
I did the stupidest thing once about a year ago is we

343
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,520
were getting a ton of spam and fishing via office files.

344
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,710
And so I floated the idea of, hey,

345
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,200
what happens if we block office files from being sent to us?

346
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:54,539
Whoa. Yeah, I walked that back real fast after marketing sales research and

347
00:14:54,989 --> 00:14:56,919
everybody at the CS A yelled at me

348
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,250
like

349
00:14:58,489 --> 00:15:01,219
I apologize like I straight up was like,

350
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,039
I am so sorry, like

351
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:03,609
uh

352
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:06,440
I don't usually make mistakes this bad but like

353
00:15:07,099 --> 00:15:07,219
uh

354
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:08,580
yeah,

355
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,299
I'm sorry, please don't set me on fire.

356
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:15,640
So here's where I think we should kind of, let's take your three things. Right.

357
00:15:15,979 --> 00:15:20,010
Don't scan QR codes. Has that ever actually been a threat? I don't think so.

358
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:24,900
I think that's movie plot in super limited situations with people who

359
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,260
really aren't paying attention to what they're then ending up on.

360
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,570
But I mean, these are the kind of people where

361
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:32,539
you could probably just

362
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,609
tell them to do it or whatever, you know,

363
00:15:34,619 --> 00:15:36,640
and they're just gonna do it because they're not paying attention or something.

364
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,109
Like it's, it's enough of a corner case that I'm not going to worry about it.

365
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:42,070
I, I agree the same thing with public wi fi like, can you get

366
00:15:42,369 --> 00:15:42,409
a, no,

367
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,489
no, no, no, no. That one will get to that one's,

368
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:45,830
that one's a little special

369
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,789
now. Password complexity.

370
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:51,150
Nist gave out this advice.

371
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,460
They've said they were wrong

372
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,890
but I think

373
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,570
the damage was done. Not just said they were wrong but they like

374
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,940
amended the standard, like straight up, they rewrote 80, what is it?

375
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,489
800-63 or something? I

376
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:07,799
don't remember which one. It is 53 maybe. I don't know. It has a three in it

377
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:09,409
that narrows it down.

378
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:14,289
Good job anyways. It starts with 800 probably.

379
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,940
And actually that I would say even that advice is

380
00:16:18,349 --> 00:16:20,489
wrong in the sense of the correct advice is

381
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,650
use a password manager and machine generated passwords.

382
00:16:23,854 --> 00:16:25,854
But those didn't exist, but

383
00:16:26,044 --> 00:16:30,835
they do now back then they do now. And I agree. I think, I think that the lesson here

384
00:16:31,005 --> 00:16:32,044
is that

385
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:34,125
any security advice,

386
00:16:34,135 --> 00:16:38,924
any security best practices need to be revisited on a constant basis because

387
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,950
whatever was true

388
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:44,010
at some point in time probably won't be true

389
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,989
later just because that's the nature of progress.

390
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,919
Yeah, perfect examples.

391
00:16:47,929 --> 00:16:50,580
The White House actually came out and said if you're going to do multi,

392
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,809
well, they said that you have to do multi factor authentication

393
00:16:53,909 --> 00:16:55,789
and it cannot be S MS anymore

394
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:56,940
because

395
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,450
yeah, like S MS fishing and blah, blah, blah.

396
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,700
It's or man in the middle, blah, da, da, da, da.

397
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,859
Yeah, it s MS is dead.

398
00:17:03,979 --> 00:17:04,530
Gotta go.

399
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:05,140
Yeah.

400
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:10,010
Yeah, I mean, it's still better than nothing, obviously, but not much.

401
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,598
Well, but here's the beauty in some cases,

402
00:17:11,608 --> 00:17:15,358
it's actually worse because by popping your phone number and then most of

403
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:18,130
these sites have used your phone number for recovery and you get the code

404
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:19,479
and so you just,

405
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,300
the Attackers are doing like industrial fishing here.

406
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,770
They don't care what ends up in the net just that they get something.

407
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,219
And so in a way S MS actually makes that a lot easier for them to accomplish.

408
00:17:28,229 --> 00:17:31,500
So it actually makes things worse in some ways. All right. Anyway. Anyway.

409
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,959
But, yeah, so onto. Ok.

410
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,459
So the public wi Fi thing now,

411
00:17:34,469 --> 00:17:39,400
I think public wi fi is special because do you remember back in the day

412
00:17:39,579 --> 00:17:40,180
when

413
00:17:40,719 --> 00:17:44,699
there were actual tools that would like spy on public wi Fi?

414
00:17:44,709 --> 00:17:47,540
I was going to say the defcon or was it the wall of sheep?

415
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,170
Right.

416
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,260
And what was, wasn't there another tool called it?

417
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:56,060
Was it fire Sheep that was designed to spy on web, web requests of public wi Fi.

418
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,890
Yeah, I did like art shenanigans and no Ds intersection or something.

419
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,739
I don't remember anymore. But you get the idea is this was a legitimate concern.

420
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,260
My favorite was, oh, I don't even, I was, I was at a little

421
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:10,949
local hacker con. This is like a decade ago probably.

422
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:15,630
And someone basically just set up a sniffer on the public wi Fi

423
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,849
looking at URL S and anytime there is a URL with an image,

424
00:18:18,859 --> 00:18:20,829
it would put the image up on the big screen.

425
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,520
And of course,

426
00:18:21,689 --> 00:18:24,390
it's always funny because someone ends up looking up at porn or something. But

427
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,910
you know, it, it was,

428
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,750
it was hilarious because people are like doing

429
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,790
stuff and it's appearing and they're like,

430
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,790
oh, but the picture of my house is up there.

431
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,859
It's like, yeah, that

432
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:34,780
yes,

433
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,709
yeah, I mean, this is a perfect example

434
00:18:37,459 --> 00:18:41,479
like on my list of essentially um I have a list of

435
00:18:41,489 --> 00:18:45,290
criteria for evaluating cloud providers for the cloud security lines to use.

436
00:18:45,569 --> 00:18:49,949
And one of them because the list is very, very old is do they do HTTP S

437
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,530
not like, do they do it all the time? But do they even support it at all?

438
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,939
And then that morphed into

439
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,339
do they require HTTP S for the login?

440
00:18:57,349 --> 00:19:00,000
Because remember for the longest time banks would have like an HTP

441
00:19:00,469 --> 00:19:03,689
Yeah, login page that then went to an HTPS site

442
00:19:03,829 --> 00:19:05,630
and it was like, well, no, that doesn't work because

443
00:19:06,189 --> 00:19:08,729
you can just rewrite the HTP to go wherever, right?

444
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,020
And then

445
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:15,189
it morphed into OK. Everybody, most everybody is doing htps. Are they doing hsts?

446
00:19:15,199 --> 00:19:19,010
That is required like saying that you have to use HTTP S to get to me.

447
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,900
And if you can't, don't come here, right?

448
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:25,050
With the gold standard being is do they go into the HSTS preload

449
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:29,329
list which is an actual like file with URL S like for example,

450
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,290
cried.org is in there and it's in about almost the

451
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,930
top 100 because I was in there pretty early.

452
00:19:33,199 --> 00:19:35,079
You talk about it a lot. And so yeah,

453
00:19:35,569 --> 00:19:36,010
and

454
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,770
you know paypal does it a bunch of banks, do it, yay.

455
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:42,099
But like, yeah, back in the day, 10 years ago,

456
00:19:43,069 --> 00:19:46,189
do they even do HTTP S at all? Was

457
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,339
like maybe, but nowadays,

458
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,939
it's all 10 years ago, you could make the plausible argument

459
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,729
that using public Wi Fi is dangerous.

460
00:19:55,829 --> 00:20:01,729
Now, I would say that 99.9% of the time you're using public Wi Fi,

461
00:20:01,739 --> 00:20:05,035
it's probably fine unless you're at a hacker conference or something.

462
00:20:05,045 --> 00:20:07,984
But if you're just at Starbucks and you're checking your email,

463
00:20:07,994 --> 00:20:09,905
you're probably going to be ok.

464
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:15,494
So obviously advice was handed out saying be careful when you do this, you know VPN.

465
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:16,515
Sure, whatever,

466
00:20:17,204 --> 00:20:17,885
but now

467
00:20:18,155 --> 00:20:20,795
VPN providers sure as heck aren't shady and monitoring traffic.

468
00:20:21,084 --> 00:20:22,515
We know that now, I mean,

469
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,435
that was always the suspicion

470
00:20:25,645 --> 00:20:30,344
they didn't exist back then. It was a lot of corporate VPN back then. And now

471
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:34,959
we've reached a point where people are still saying don't use public wi Fi.

472
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,359
But the reality is

473
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:40,439
there's not a lot happening on the internet that isn't encrypted these days.

474
00:20:40,449 --> 00:20:41,839
And so public wi fi

475
00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:42,660
really,

476
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:45,479
someone looking over your shoulder is probably a far bigger

477
00:20:45,489 --> 00:20:47,994
threat than the public wi Fi at the coffee shop.

478
00:20:48,224 --> 00:20:48,555
Yeah,

479
00:20:48,704 --> 00:20:51,364
I think the other problem is sort of orthogonal to this is that

480
00:20:51,494 --> 00:20:54,244
a lot of this advice was meant for people who are like,

481
00:20:54,255 --> 00:20:55,755
worried about a targeted attack.

482
00:20:55,765 --> 00:20:58,714
So if you're worried about a targeted attack, there is some stuff you should do.

483
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:01,915
Like, yeah, like not use public Wi Fi or other things, right? Because just, even

484
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:05,260
just kind of the traffic analysis might be enough for your adversary to

485
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,329
learn stuff about you that you don't want them to know about you.

486
00:21:07,439 --> 00:21:09,199
But that's not a problem for us.

487
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,140
And by us, I mean, everybody on the planet who's not a journalist,

488
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:16,449
I will find the document that's Massad versus not mossad for

489
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,339
kind of threat situations. And that's what we're right.

490
00:21:19,349 --> 00:21:23,599
Like the, the, the, the best example is the, if, if you're dealing with

491
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,579
a situation where you're a target of like an international group,

492
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:29,479
the security group,

493
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:30,760
like the,

494
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:34,160
the joke in it was that Massad changes out your cell

495
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:36,430
phone for a brick of uranium gives you brain cancer,

496
00:21:36,439 --> 00:21:38,530
you die and then they buy you a state like

497
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,760
that's basically what would happen.

498
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,359
They, they can wait, you know, they, they, you know,

499
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,369
they buy the NSO product with the, uh,

500
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,760
with the zero days and send you a text that pops your phone open.

501
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:50,880
Right. And, and so,

502
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,719
and I think that's the, you know what, I think that's what a lot of

503
00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:56,410
it is, is I think a lot of security people,

504
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,760
we love thinking about the targeted attacks. The

505
00:21:59,880 --> 00:21:59,920
movie

506
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:00,319
plot,

507
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,420
we love thinking about the movie plots.

508
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,880
We want to believe that we're special and we're going to be attacked.

509
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,729
And so we need to tell all our friends that they also

510
00:22:08,739 --> 00:22:11,410
need to act in a special way when the reality is like,

511
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:15,680
I used to be really, we'll say bizarre about a lot of my security practices.

512
00:22:15,689 --> 00:22:17,250
And then one day I'm like, honestly

513
00:22:17,689 --> 00:22:18,849
none of this matters,

514
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,239
but the way I protected my SSH key was

515
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:26,900
I could tell like a half hour story of all the steps I took,

516
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:30,170
but I guarantee I had better protection on my SSH

517
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:34,300
key than most corporations had on their signing keys.

518
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:38,189
Like for real, it was completely bananas. What I did.

519
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,469
I remember like running workloads in Amazon EC2,

520
00:22:41,479 --> 00:22:45,709
but not trusting them to enough to use the elastic load balancer with

521
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,780
their SSL certs. And then I realized like, hang on,

522
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:49,920
that's no,

523
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:52,390
let's just use the LB it's easier,

524
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:54,239
you know,

525
00:22:54,569 --> 00:22:55,030
like

526
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:55,859
uh yeah,

527
00:22:56,189 --> 00:22:57,020
I think that's,

528
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:02,170
I think that movie plot aspect is part of it because yeah, we want infosec to kind of,

529
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,810
we want to sex it up because the majority of infosec is

530
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:07,949
literally inventory all your systems and patch them up to date.

531
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:12,869
Once you've done that, then we can discuss maybe buying a firewall.

532
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,250
Although in the modern world, probably not

533
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,989
like literally the only reason we have a firewall at

534
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,290
CS A is because to run a wireless network,

535
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:20,810
you have to

536
00:23:20,939 --> 00:23:24,150
stick on that box in front of it. Well, they're all firewalls and

537
00:23:24,329 --> 00:23:27,300
ubiquity makes a really nice what is called the Security Dream or something.

538
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:27,650
And like,

539
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:31,599
it's just an all in one box and it was cheap and reliable. So we went with that.

540
00:23:31,709 --> 00:23:32,310
But otherwise,

541
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,880
like the only reason I have a firewall here is

542
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,859
because that's what my wi fi does by default.

543
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,770
Like, no, because I actually have I PV six controlling.

544
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:43,380
They have like, like these are live I PV six. Like they are internet

545
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,969
attach. Like my, my ISP actually hands me a proper,

546
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,329
what's it like a slash 56 or 64? I

547
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,930
can't even keep track of I PV six. So like,

548
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,709
yeah, like literally if you have an inventory,

549
00:23:55,719 --> 00:23:59,109
like if you can't conclusively tell me what all you have

550
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:01,349
for systems and hardware and that they're up to date.

551
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:04,589
Yeah. Come back when you have and then we can talk about security.

552
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,310
I mean, I think that's an overly simplistic view

553
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,030
but

554
00:24:09,219 --> 00:24:10,329
I, I think

555
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,719
what you're on to is that

556
00:24:12,979 --> 00:24:15,599
there are things we can do

557
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:21,319
that have real and direct consequences for our business or lives or whatever.

558
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:23,520
And then there's the crap that doesn't matter and

559
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:27,540
obsessing over QR codes being worried about password complexity,

560
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:30,069
telling your employees not to use public wi fi

561
00:24:30,729 --> 00:24:33,310
none of that matters. If you stop doing that tomorrow,

562
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,829
nothing would change.

563
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,949
And, and I think that now of course, getting this advice to die

564
00:24:40,219 --> 00:24:42,040
is one of the next challenges.

565
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:42,890
And I, I don't,

566
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,770
I don't know what's funny to me is that this advice has already largely died

567
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,550
for everybody under the age of 30 just by virtue

568
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,030
of the fact that they have a cell phone.

569
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,349
And that's kind of one of their primary platforms,

570
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:54,300
I guess.

571
00:24:54,719 --> 00:24:56,569
I mean, maybe that that could be

572
00:24:58,229 --> 00:25:02,250
on a cell phone. You can, you, it just stuff kind of just works.

573
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,780
And for example, like it's really, it's actually difficult to see

574
00:25:06,229 --> 00:25:07,670
um here. Yeah, like,

575
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,250
oh, interesting. Yeah.

576
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,859
So like if I go to CBC dot C A,

577
00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:13,650
it's actually http S like I have to click on the thing and kind of like wait

578
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,310
for the URL to come up and I have to scroll around a bit to see it.

579
00:25:17,069 --> 00:25:17,489
But

580
00:25:17,869 --> 00:25:18,329
that's the thing.

581
00:25:18,339 --> 00:25:22,189
Like on the modern internet with a modern device, it's all http S it's all encrypted.

582
00:25:22,199 --> 00:25:23,660
It's all like,

583
00:25:23,949 --> 00:25:26,869
we're getting to the point where DNS over HTTP is, is,

584
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,280
is a thing and it's becoming more widespread.

585
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:31,199
So even the whole argument of like all the,

586
00:25:31,209 --> 00:25:33,689
the Attackers can see your DNS traffic and know that you, like,

587
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:37,130
like to go buy bananas from banana.com or whatever.

588
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,069
Like, nope, that's going away.

589
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,489
I, I think what drives me nuts is,

590
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,270
it's not just the focus that we lose by telling

591
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,239
people these silly things that sort of the operational cost.

592
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,459
Like, again, like that whole, like,

593
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,469
don't open emails from untrusted people. Well, but

594
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,780
a big part of my job is talking to strangers. We're hiring my replacement again.

595
00:25:56,869 --> 00:25:58,040
Third time's a charm.

596
00:25:58,219 --> 00:26:01,900
And, um, although this time we're smart, we're hiring a manager and a team

597
00:26:02,109 --> 00:26:03,589
to replace my operations.

598
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:07,579
So, yeah, that we finally figured it out. What can I say? I'm really good at it.

599
00:26:07,589 --> 00:26:08,890
I'm old school.

600
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:14,420
But the thing is like, I have to open up a bunch of resumes and like about

601
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:18,089
15% of them are doc files. I'm like, whatever. I, I,

602
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,599
you're kind of already sorted to the bottom of the

603
00:26:20,609 --> 00:26:22,500
pile mentally for me if you can't make a PDF.

604
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,260
But whatever, I'll give you a fair chance

605
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:25,560
and like,

606
00:26:25,829 --> 00:26:26,400
you know, I,

607
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,290
I chucked them through virus total just to be on the

608
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,250
super safe side because I'm opening them up on my desktop.

609
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,500
Like I'm not getting a burner system to read resumes.

610
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,380
You know,

611
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:36,609
and I truck these files through virus total and then I open them and I'm sure there's,

612
00:26:36,619 --> 00:26:38,550
people are like, oh my God, Kurt opened a doc file.

613
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,150
I can, like,

614
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,869
target and attack them. Well, yeah.

615
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,920
And if you can get your vi, like,

616
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,349
if you can get your hostile payload through an up to date

617
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:46,719
windows 11 system and I'm chucking this stuff through virus total.

618
00:26:46,729 --> 00:26:48,880
Cool. Go sell that exploit to Mossad,

619
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:49,810
right?

620
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:50,239
Like

621
00:26:50,469 --> 00:26:53,180
you're gonna make a lot more money than popping me. That's right.

622
00:26:53,719 --> 00:26:56,729
You know, and that's my strategy with like, the cloud security stuff is like, yeah,

623
00:26:56,739 --> 00:26:58,439
we're in Google if you can pop us in Google,

624
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:02,180
but you're gonna go take over that bank next door to us. I mean, you'd help.

625
00:27:02,189 --> 00:27:06,839
But it, it's fair anyway. Anyway. So, and I think that's part of it is just

626
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:08,540
like, yeah, I, I, maybe,

627
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:11,699
maybe a lot of this is just infosec kind of has to get over itself and

628
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:13,540
get rid of the movie plot thinking.

629
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:20,880
Uh, there's some of that, I think some of it as well is there was a very historic,

630
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:24,849
I guess a view of hackers as the superheroes, which, I mean,

631
00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:27,400
I think there's a lot of amazing things they do.

632
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,750
But the reality is, I mean, when you're in infosec,

633
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:34,780
I would say it should be a lot more similar to accounting than to like fighter pilot,

634
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,619
you know. What I mean?

635
00:27:35,869 --> 00:27:38,969
I mean, I, I like my favorite example is, is the cake, what is it?

636
00:27:38,979 --> 00:27:41,250
The, the CIA Q document from the CS C

637
00:27:41,709 --> 00:27:43,109
Assessment initiative questionnaire?

638
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,770
Oh Caiq, I always get those screwed up anyway.

639
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:50,589
Like basically it's just what like 300 controls you go through and answer it

640
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:53,339
and then instead of having to fill out a new questionnaire for everyone,

641
00:27:53,349 --> 00:27:54,199
you just be like

642
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,689
a little cake. Take this

643
00:27:55,969 --> 00:27:59,069
and 99% of the time people are like, oh, thank goodness a cake,

644
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:03,290
I'll just take this from you so you can compare them. I know they're amazing.

645
00:28:03,339 --> 00:28:04,739
But the point is like,

646
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,770
that's really boring though. You know what I mean?

647
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:09,609
Like filling it out isn't exciting.

648
00:28:09,619 --> 00:28:13,050
Reviewing, it isn't exciting comparing them isn't exciting, but

649
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,849
it's an example of where you can do some work,

650
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:20,920
reuse the work and it's not just like pointless questionnaires

651
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:23,170
you're filling out and passing around for no apparent reason.

652
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:26,150
I, I actually, I, I gave that talk today and

653
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,140
that was one of the points I made especially I

654
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:32,000
can't say I gave that talk today because literally no one knows what today is

655
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:32,660
that

656
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,560
anyway, it doesn't matter because the point is one of the points I made

657
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:38,280
link in the show notes. Kurt just gave a talk

658
00:28:39,069 --> 00:28:41,849
anyways. One of the uh the points was that

659
00:28:42,489 --> 00:28:44,459
the security needs to,

660
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:48,290
the security needs to be automated and these emails being sent out like,

661
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,829
what are you doing about log for J are you blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

662
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,439
And it was all like,

663
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,800
it wasn't even a, there wasn't even a spreadsheet.

664
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:57,920
It was just an email with a bunch of text and you're supposed to reply with,

665
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:59,310
I guess free form text

666
00:28:59,469 --> 00:29:02,760
to. It was like security compliance at the vendor name.com.

667
00:29:02,939 --> 00:29:06,650
And you know, I make the point that this is all human generated human process.

668
00:29:06,819 --> 00:29:08,030
Like, it's just garbage

669
00:29:08,869 --> 00:29:11,010
and it was three days late. It was a lock for Jane.

670
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,390
They sent this email to us on a Monday and I was like,

671
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,829
we've had 72 hours of log for Jay. Like, if you haven't fixed it too

672
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:17,660
late. Yeah,

673
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:18,619
you're done.

674
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:19,290
And

675
00:29:19,729 --> 00:29:21,300
that kind of stuff needs to go

676
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,089
away because, like, it,

677
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:26,540
it doesn't work, it's too late. It's not effective. It's inefficient

678
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,329
like

679
00:29:28,709 --> 00:29:31,160
that effort that they put into that they should have put into like, oh,

680
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,349
we need to do some automation.

681
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:32,729
Like,

682
00:29:32,859 --> 00:29:34,890
maybe we need to get cakes from all our vendors.

683
00:29:35,219 --> 00:29:36,709
I mean, yeah, that's a good start.

684
00:29:36,829 --> 00:29:39,810
You know, and again, it's a, it's a sign of maturity as well.

685
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,630
If you filled it out, you kind of have a clue.

686
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,650
You know, this is like, anyway,

687
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:45,989
major quote, un, quote, serious security vendor.

688
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,849
Like you, you use them every day kind of thing. I'm not surprised at all.

689
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:53,239
I, I, I've seen many things, I've seen it all more than once. Right.

690
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,189
We should, we, we need to wrap this one up.

691
00:29:55,890 --> 00:30:00,630
I guess my parting thought on this whole thing is that

692
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:05,160
there is an enormous amount of security best practices.

693
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,050
I'm doing air quotes right now, but no one can see.

694
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:07,900
And

695
00:30:08,189 --> 00:30:09,520
that's the beauty of radio.

696
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:12,939
There's best practices and I think it is important.

697
00:30:12,949 --> 00:30:16,219
We review them on a regular basis, but I know we almost never do.

698
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:20,449
And there is an enormous amount of advice we hand out.

699
00:30:20,459 --> 00:30:23,030
There's an enormous amount of steps we take today

700
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,680
that probably don't really matter.

701
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,560
And

702
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:30,459
it's hard to find out some, it's, it's hard to realize what those are sometimes.

703
00:30:30,469 --> 00:30:32,540
But, you know, after the fact it seems easy. But

704
00:30:32,739 --> 00:30:34,699
anyway, I, I think that's the thing. It's just,

705
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:38,219
like, constantly pay attention to what you're doing, constantly ask, like,

706
00:30:38,229 --> 00:30:40,020
what is this actually accomplishing?

707
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:43,750
Yeah, there's a good story of, you know, for example, when you leave the harbor,

708
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,750
you turn the ship 360 degrees around in a

709
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,920
circle before you leave the harbor for good luck.

710
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,650
And somebody points out that maybe it's, you know, it's a way of testing the rudder.

711
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:54,050
So if the rudder is gonna break it snaps off and you, you break in harbor, not

712
00:30:54,439 --> 00:30:55,599
out in the middle of nowhere, right?

713
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,540
I don't know.

714
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:58,869
And so, well, anyway, the point is, like you said, I think that's,

715
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,910
it's not just reassessing are these security practices working.

716
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:02,890
But

717
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,219
what are these security practices meant to do because

718
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:09,199
there's a whole bunch of security practices that I don't do anymore

719
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,079
because I'm, I'm cloud based.

720
00:31:11,439 --> 00:31:13,989
Like, there's just a whole bunch of physical security stuff that

721
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,609
doesn't apply to me.

722
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,839
Like, I, it's,

723
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:17,770
you know,

724
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:18,140
I

725
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:21,869
hear you. And so I think maybe, like you said, it's, it's that step of,

726
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:25,680
look at what you're actually trying to accomplish and, and make sure that, that

727
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:26,589
like

728
00:31:26,829 --> 00:31:28,020
makes sense

729
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,640
before then you look at how you're doing it because

730
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,500
like a lot of people spend a lot of time. Let's chop down trees more efficiently.

731
00:31:34,569 --> 00:31:36,449
But it's like, are we in the right forest?

732
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,180
Nobody knows

733
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:39,510
it.

734
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:39,989
