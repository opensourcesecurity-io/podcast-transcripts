Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,909
Kurt Siefried and my partner in crimes against scale.

2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,800
-- Josh
-- Pressers. I mean, what is, come on? That's lame.

3
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,110
That doesn't even mean anything.

4
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:18,110
Ok. I'll redo it. No, no, it's too late.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,110
I'm not going to let you like it's done, it's done. It's etched in stone, it stays.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,709
That's the beauty of being the editor is I wield the ultimate control.

7
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,049
I could make you sound like an idiot if I wanted to.

8
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:32,189
-- I was surprised
-- you've never made me chipmunk voice.

9
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,849
I, I don't, I don't, I'm too lazy to do any of that sort of thing.

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,119
I just, I, I wield my power

11
00:00:38,889 --> 00:00:40,680
anyway. Anyway.

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,169
So scale because one thing I've been noticing,

13
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,599
what do you, what do we mean by scale?

14
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,689
Well, security at scale and what I mean by that is I,

15
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,770
I've been noticing a lot of people who say, oh, I can do that

16
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:53,130
and the answer is yes, yes,

17
00:00:53,139 --> 00:00:57,610
you can absolutely cook a hamburger or find a security vulnerability,

18
00:00:58,119 --> 00:00:58,650
you know,

19
00:00:58,849 --> 00:01:00,330
but the problem becomes

20
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,119
well because I mean,

21
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:06,959
I just had the experience right of I updated 30,806 GSD entries with the Souza Ulg

22
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:08,169
did not like that.

23
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:08,839
Well,

24
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:11,819
I love the one tweet comment where it's like basically he got

25
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,309
like blocked by the API for abuse by just trying to look at

26
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:15,980
it. So

27
00:01:16,394 --> 00:01:20,864
yeah, II I get this a lot. I I went, you asked me to approve that full request.

28
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:24,474
I'm not gonna link to it because just don't, don't, your browser doesn't like it.

29
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:24,955
Anyway,

30
00:01:25,074 --> 00:01:28,885
I went to the files change tab just to see what it would say.

31
00:01:28,894 --> 00:01:33,845
And it just showed an infinity symbol. I said there are too many files to show.

32
00:01:34,389 --> 00:01:36,309
Yeah. So anyway, anyway,

33
00:01:36,419 --> 00:01:36,720
well,

34
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:41,410
and the funny thing is like on my local machine when I was flipping between branches,

35
00:01:41,419 --> 00:01:41,919
it was

36
00:01:42,059 --> 00:01:44,730
actually, it only took about 30 to 60 seconds to,

37
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,300
to like essentially rewrite every single one of those 30,000 files,

38
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:49,330
which is pretty impressive.

39
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,910
IG is pretty fast.

40
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:56,449
I'm, I'm always amazed by how just fast git does literally everything you need

41
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,449
do. I mean, it's shocking at times.

42
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:02,050
Well, again, the Linux chrome is working on scale. It's probably one of the biggest

43
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:06,589
I would say active code bases in the sense of there are definitely bigger code bases,

44
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:09,529
but they aren't nearly as active as with respect

45
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:12,070
to change velocity as the Linux kernel is.

46
00:02:12,149 --> 00:02:16,529
-- Yeah.
-- And they work in some really wild ways the way they use branches and they do.

47
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:16,880
I mean,

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,710
I remember back in the day

49
00:02:18,929 --> 00:02:19,570
when

50
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,589
the dominant source management system was CVS.

51
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:24,399
And like,

52
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:28,339
there's just no way the Linux kernel could have even existed in that ecosystem.

53
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,179
It was just too slow and too clunky and it could, I mean,

54
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:35,100
I remember trying to do like branches and merges in CVS and it was like,

55
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:39,779
you needed some sort of advanced degree in mathematics to actually make it work.

56
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:40,660
It was madness.

57
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:42,500
I actually remember somebody with a degree in math,

58
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:44,210
wrote a paper about that stuff and how

59
00:02:44,542 --> 00:02:45,643
essentially, well, no,

60
00:02:45,652 --> 00:02:50,223
the problem is that a lot of these tools were designed by academics because, well,

61
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:52,662
if you design one of these tools commercially, you sold it,

62
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:53,843
you didn't open source it, right?

63
00:02:53,852 --> 00:02:55,203
Like bit Keeper tried and

64
00:02:55,973 --> 00:02:57,412
do they still even exist.

65
00:02:58,322 --> 00:02:58,882
They must

66
00:02:59,093 --> 00:03:02,483
-- nothing ever dies. Yeah. So bit Keeper is the reason we have it
-- because wasn't it?

67
00:03:02,492 --> 00:03:03,503
Andrew Tannenbaum

68
00:03:03,742 --> 00:03:05,962
-- type to help?
-- Yeah, basically.

69
00:03:06,822 --> 00:03:07,013
Yeah.

70
00:03:07,022 --> 00:03:11,246
So what happened is Bit Keeper gave the Linux kernel like a license for using bit.

71
00:03:11,546 --> 00:03:12,046
-- OK. Hold
-- on, hold on.

72
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:15,126
Let's, let's start at the, if we're going to tell this story, we're going to tell it,

73
00:03:15,136 --> 00:03:15,466
right.

74
00:03:15,656 --> 00:03:17,666
So in the early days,

75
00:03:17,776 --> 00:03:20,886
the Linux kernel had no source management.

76
00:03:20,895 --> 00:03:24,386
Linus used an FTP site and people would mail him patches

77
00:03:24,595 --> 00:03:25,925
like that was it that

78
00:03:26,356 --> 00:03:30,186
-- they did. And it, well, it worked. We'll say I won't say pretty good at that
-- scale.

79
00:03:30,195 --> 00:03:33,026
It works when you have like 10 patches a day that can work.

80
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:37,860
And there is the Linux kernel mailing list was basically the change log, right.

81
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:39,809
Well,

82
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:40,800
anyway,

83
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:42,160
and then

84
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:45,550
Linus decided they needed source code management and they

85
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:49,029
ended up with a closed source product called Bit Keeper

86
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,470
-- because
-- it was the only choice.

87
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,539
It was the only one that could probably do what they needed at the time.

88
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,860
The Bit Keeper developers basically said we will let you use this for free.

89
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,110
But here's a bunch of terms you must agree with.

90
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:05,750
And one of them was like, basically no reverse engineering what we're doing

91
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:06,904
because I think they,

92
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:10,264
they knew what would happen if someone reverse engineered it,

93
00:04:10,274 --> 00:04:11,425
which is exactly what happened.

94
00:04:11,705 --> 00:04:13,404
And then I believe it was Andrew Tanenbaum

95
00:04:13,524 --> 00:04:14,955
who is in charge of Samba

96
00:04:15,104 --> 00:04:16,845
basically one day,

97
00:04:16,994 --> 00:04:18,024
like just typed,

98
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,184
like connected to the Bit Keeper server and typed help, right?

99
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:24,165
And it listed some information and then like there was some, you know,

100
00:04:24,174 --> 00:04:27,625
a little bit of chatting and stuff and the Bit Keeper people got really angry

101
00:04:27,825 --> 00:04:29,024
and they booted him

102
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,209
and then there was a bunch of weird politics and a bunch of madness.

103
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,649
And basically Linus was like, we're done

104
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:39,059
and he took what, like a month off of working on the kernel and literally wrote Git,

105
00:04:40,049 --> 00:04:40,809
you know, I mean, it's,

106
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,369
it's hilarious to me that one person is probably responsible

107
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,290
for like 80% of everything we touch every day.

108
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:48,309
Be git and Linux,

109
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:48,929
I mean,

110
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:52,190
-- it's madness
-- and one of the reasons it works so well is he

111
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,649
has worked at all these different scales and is aware of them.

112
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:54,950
So

113
00:04:55,089 --> 00:04:58,149
like he's one of the few people that's not doing premature optimization.

114
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,890
I think there's something even more important than that is

115
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:02,785
this is something I run into all the time.

116
00:05:02,795 --> 00:05:05,225
And I'm going to specifically call out like the current SB

117
00:05:05,424 --> 00:05:08,815
formats where there's SPDX and there's cycling DX, right?

118
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:11,355
These are formats that were built by committees

119
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:14,825
and you can, you can do as much work as you want in a committee.

120
00:05:14,834 --> 00:05:18,144
But when the rubber hits the road, when you have to actually start doing things,

121
00:05:18,404 --> 00:05:20,234
that's when the real change happens.

122
00:05:20,244 --> 00:05:24,915
And in the case of Linus, he's always been solving real problems versus

123
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,130
going to a committee

124
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,649
and defining problems and then trying to solve them.

125
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,609
It's very different how that works.

126
00:05:32,619 --> 00:05:35,130
Well, actually, I think it's, it's more subtle than that.

127
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:38,690
It's um and I, I want to say Joel Spolsky writes about this,

128
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:42,850
-- he writes about everything. Well,
-- he writes about having taste, good taste.

129
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:47,619
The thing is you can have an artist or an expert or a skilled machinist or in this case,

130
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,329
a very skilled software developer like Lyne

131
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:49,679
Torvalds

132
00:05:50,179 --> 00:05:51,950
who has excellent taste,

133
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:54,649
but then you run that through a committee process and it destroys it.

134
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:54,890
Oh, yeah.

135
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:55,420
Yeah.

136
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:58,489
And so I think that's part of the subtlety here is is that there's a lot

137
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,570
of situations where a person or one or

138
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:04,260
two people create something actually quite good,

139
00:06:04,355 --> 00:06:07,175
beautiful and then the committee just destroys it.

140
00:06:07,436 --> 00:06:11,325
It happens anyway, we're supposed to be talking about insecurity at scale.

141
00:06:11,335 --> 00:06:12,496
Well, but this feeds it.

142
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:15,055
This is the whole problem with security at scale is

143
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:17,615
security at scale is no longer a technical problem.

144
00:06:17,626 --> 00:06:21,746
It's a policy, strategic logistics problem, is it? Ok.

145
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,656
Josh, I just found 10,000 vulnerabilities in your software product.

146
00:06:24,665 --> 00:06:28,615
And here's a list, they're all perfectly scoped out. There's no patches.

147
00:06:28,626 --> 00:06:29,506
So good luck with that.

148
00:06:29,761 --> 00:06:31,101
I've gotten reports like that.

149
00:06:31,111 --> 00:06:33,291
I remember there were people who used to run Fuzzs

150
00:06:33,302 --> 00:06:35,821
and send stuff like that and it was ridiculous.

151
00:06:35,832 --> 00:06:36,201
Ok.

152
00:06:36,212 --> 00:06:37,951
Here's the thing with the actual 10,000 exploit

153
00:06:37,962 --> 00:06:40,101
codes that actually get remote root on,

154
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:40,582
you know what I mean?

155
00:06:40,592 --> 00:06:41,432
Like, it doesn't,

156
00:06:41,441 --> 00:06:44,902
basically the point is no matter how high quality you still have to, like,

157
00:06:44,911 --> 00:06:45,462
go through it,

158
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:48,941
understand each vulnerability and patch it and doing one or two of those.

159
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:51,062
Sure. 10, maybe 100. Ok.

160
00:06:51,071 --> 00:06:54,302
We can work on this for a few weeks but if somebody comes to you with 10,000 of them.

161
00:06:54,312 --> 00:06:55,101
Well, what do you do?

162
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:56,880
Yeah.

163
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:58,779
My, my

164
00:06:59,049 --> 00:07:00,609
overly dramatic pause.

165
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:04,609
I'll leave in but no, you, you're not, you're not kind of wrong in that instance.

166
00:07:04,619 --> 00:07:07,029
I, I'll tell you what would happen in most cases.

167
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,459
If, if I showed up to an organization.

168
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:14,869
And I said here are 10,000 security findings. Do you know what they do?

169
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:18,459
They, they ban me and tell me they're gonna sue me if I publish any of them.

170
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:20,519
Like it, it's, this is why like

171
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,380
I'm going to call this episode insecurity at scale because I think

172
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,899
when we talk about security after we reach a certain point,

173
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,230
if the organization isn't prepared,

174
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,070
it turns into a legal mess and it's really insecurity at scale.

175
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,359
-- It's not security at scale.
-- One thing that gets me.

176
00:07:36,442 --> 00:07:40,502
Uh so, you know, COVID rolled around and a whole bunch of organizations were like,

177
00:07:40,513 --> 00:07:43,713
holy cow, we need to enable work from home at scale.

178
00:07:43,722 --> 00:07:46,463
Like they maybe had a few people working from home before, but, you know,

179
00:07:46,472 --> 00:07:47,632
not everybody.

180
00:07:47,752 --> 00:07:48,472
And so like,

181
00:07:48,562 --> 00:07:51,342
literally a lot of organizations didn't even have enough upload

182
00:07:51,352 --> 00:07:54,882
bandwidth from their data centers to support everybody working from home

183
00:07:55,273 --> 00:07:59,523
or the more recent, you know, the, the, the conflicts between, well,

184
00:07:59,532 --> 00:08:02,042
the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it's not a conflict, it's an invasion

185
00:08:02,376 --> 00:08:05,216
and all of a sudden a lot of Western companies are freaking out and going, oh my,

186
00:08:05,226 --> 00:08:07,966
you know, we're on some sort of heightened cyber alert status and it's like,

187
00:08:07,976 --> 00:08:10,126
so now you're worried about cybersecurity.

188
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:12,936
It's always been this bad. It's just we were kind of ignoring it.

189
00:08:13,246 --> 00:08:16,406
And I think that's part of the problem with scale is that it's like global warming,

190
00:08:16,415 --> 00:08:18,246
we've just been ignoring how bad it is

191
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:22,765
and the scale of it is horrifying. Like, do I start recycling? Will that fix it?

192
00:08:22,776 --> 00:08:27,635
-- Probably not.
-- I think you're conflating two different problems here. There's the

193
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,270
kind of long term structural issues I'll call them

194
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,570
that exist in meet space.

195
00:08:34,609 --> 00:08:37,530
But when we're talking about this, the technology scale,

196
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:39,679
I think there's kind of a different thing because

197
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:43,400
we have technology to let us do huge things.

198
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:43,609
I mean,

199
00:08:43,619 --> 00:08:46,809
do you remember a decade or two decades ago when a

200
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,460
database with 1000 records in it would have been a lot

201
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:55,280
and now I can run tens of millions of records in an elastic search instance,

202
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,859
my laptop and it handles it like it's nothing.

203
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,989
But that's what I'm saying is those at scale,

204
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,440
no matter how good your technology is at scale,

205
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,320
it outstrips the technology and everything

206
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:07,309
becomes that logistics strategy policy problem,

207
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,590
right?

208
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:11,809
Because at some point you outstrip your scale of software and hardware.

209
00:09:11,849 --> 00:09:14,630
I mean, but this is we're supposed to be talking about security at scale right here.

210
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,299
Well, and that's what I mean is so for example, I can give you AC ID build pipeline

211
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:23,500
but makes it really easy to fix bugs. And that's great if you have 10 or 20 bugs. OK?

212
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,890
But it falls like, what do you do at 10,000 bugs,

213
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:27,460
right?

214
00:09:27,469 --> 00:09:30,440
And that's one of the things that's amazing to me about the Linux kernel is that

215
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,239
I love how they just take, the tact of a bug is a bug.

216
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,640
We fix bugs because bugs needs to be fixed and

217
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,840
they just fix the bugs as fast as they can.

218
00:09:37,849 --> 00:09:40,469
And then they tell people, look, if you want to

219
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:42,400
have all the bug fixes, you have to run current,

220
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:44,080
like you can't be back part of this stuff.

221
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:47,340
-- You can't be selective because this thing is too big.
-- Well, that's not true.

222
00:09:47,349 --> 00:09:47,859
That's not true.

223
00:09:47,869 --> 00:09:48,219
Ok,

224
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:50,070
I'm going to reframe this a little bit because

225
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,409
I think we're often kind of the weeds tad.

226
00:09:52,599 --> 00:09:53,159
So

227
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,260
the Linux kernel has the mainline kernel,

228
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,469
but then it also has long term support releases.

229
00:09:58,479 --> 00:09:59,710
And this is something that

230
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,469
we have been working with them a little bit on

231
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:04,650
with GSD where they send us basically a big,

232
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:09,510
great big long list of things that might be security bugs, we don't know for sure.

233
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,679
And the way they do that is,

234
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,919
uh uh there's a developer named Sasha Levin that we talked to.

235
00:10:14,929 --> 00:10:18,320
I I, he uh I'm going to try to find it. There's a talk he gave

236
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:22,299
several years ago where basically what they're doing is they're using

237
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,809
machine learning to look at kernel commit messages

238
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:29,039
and ascertain like this one could be security.

239
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:32,229
And I think the problem you get at scale,

240
00:10:32,239 --> 00:10:34,650
especially when you talk about something like security

241
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:38,469
is we like to think about security as black and white, like vulnerability,

242
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:39,500
not vulnerability.

243
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,960
But the reality is, it's this big squishy space and there's,

244
00:10:43,219 --> 00:10:44,229
yes, for sure.

245
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:47,669
And there's maybe sort of, and there's, uh, probably not, but we don't know.

246
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,549
And then there's absolutely not, you know what I mean?

247
00:10:49,609 --> 00:10:52,070
Well, and part of the challenge to make it even worse, there is

248
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,969
to say something is not a vulnerability.

249
00:10:53,979 --> 00:10:55,630
You, you kind of have to prove a negative,

250
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,210
which sometimes is easy and sometimes it is

251
00:10:57,219 --> 00:10:59,840
not so easy to prove something is vulnerable

252
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,010
is also

253
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,330
can be very easy or can be very difficult.

254
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,880
Like uh my favorite, you know, ping of death, I send you a large pink packet,

255
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:06,809
your machine crashes.

256
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,969
OK. We're all agreed that should not happen

257
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:09,669
easy.

258
00:11:09,859 --> 00:11:10,320
But oh,

259
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:13,400
here's this like possible subtle logic flaw in some

260
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:15,630
of the control flow of this other thing.

261
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:18,770
Like can it actually be reached and exploited in a meaningful way? You know what?

262
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,729
Let's just fix the logic and move on, right.

263
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:21,760
And a

264
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:24,320
lot of people are like, no, no, I want to know if it's vulnerable,

265
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,150
like if it's actually exploitable or not.

266
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,530
And sure, sure again, sure.

267
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:30,570
Ok, we can do that for a few bucks but we can't, you know,

268
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:35,570
intensely research and document every single bug because like,

269
00:11:35,789 --> 00:11:36,190
I mean,

270
00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:40,030
how we did, I think what 2000 G sds for the links kernel last year?

271
00:11:40,619 --> 00:11:42,340
Oh, at least that probably more.

272
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:45,239
We don't research them at all. We take their word for it.

273
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,869
Well, even if you had a group of smart people,

274
00:11:48,969 --> 00:11:51,510
assuming each one of these is going to take at least a few hours.

275
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:53,880
-- Well, OK,
-- look like scale.

276
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:53,900
I,

277
00:11:53,909 --> 00:11:55,640
I think here's a different way to look at this

278
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,549
and this is something I deal with on a regular basis

279
00:11:58,659 --> 00:11:59,750
because I work at

280
00:12:00,369 --> 00:12:01,510
Anor and one of the things Anor

281
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:08,099
does is we build S bombs from stuff and then we can vulnerability, scan those right

282
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:13,080
where you're taking say a container image, you scan it. And I, I have a great example.

283
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,260
Actually, I'm giving a talk,

284
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,969
I will be after it'll be after this actually gets published for the with the CNCF.

285
00:12:17,979 --> 00:12:18,780
I'm doing a live stream.

286
00:12:19,049 --> 00:12:23,039
I've taken all of the docker official container images.

287
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,500
I scan them for S

288
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,840
palm and then I vulnerability scan them and I put all

289
00:12:26,849 --> 00:12:28,950
the data in elastic search and you can dig it out right

290
00:12:29,169 --> 00:12:33,349
there is the rails official image which was deprecated five years ago,

291
00:12:33,359 --> 00:12:37,070
still available has 7000 vulnerabilities in it.

292
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,710
Now,

293
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:40,090
when you get results like that,

294
00:12:40,229 --> 00:12:43,210
it's easy to just like pull your hair out and say, oh my goodness, what's going on.

295
00:12:43,219 --> 00:12:47,619
But the reality is once you surpass, we'll say double digit vulnerabilities,

296
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:51,349
you now have to start making assumptions and making some policies

297
00:12:51,359 --> 00:12:54,530
of just saying like something with 7000 vulnerabilities just no,

298
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:55,239
just hard.

299
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:55,989
No, right?

300
00:12:56,099 --> 00:12:56,989
But let's do something as

301
00:12:57,137 --> 00:12:58,796
100 vulnerabilities. What does that mean?

302
00:12:58,976 --> 00:13:01,276
And you can't individually go through all 200.

303
00:13:01,286 --> 00:13:03,767
You have to start writing policy that can make some

304
00:13:03,776 --> 00:13:06,867
intelligent decisions based upon some of the data you have.

305
00:13:06,877 --> 00:13:09,677
And I think this is where security at scale starts to

306
00:13:09,687 --> 00:13:11,677
get hard for a lot of us to wrap our heads around

307
00:13:11,867 --> 00:13:14,656
because we've obsessed over perfect or nothing

308
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,697
for so long that we don't understand.

309
00:13:16,706 --> 00:13:20,956
There's this squishy in between where we have to make, I won't say guesses,

310
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,697
but we have to use the data available to us to make the best

311
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:27,203
decision decision we can make with that data.

312
00:13:27,434 --> 00:13:27,723
Well,

313
00:13:27,734 --> 00:13:30,093
and part of my concern there is people are making decisions that are

314
00:13:30,104 --> 00:13:33,513
framed in the sense of I have a container with 7000 vulnerabilities.

315
00:13:33,523 --> 00:13:34,414
I need to fix these.

316
00:13:34,573 --> 00:13:40,323
Well, maybe no, maybe the answer is you need to do a different technology stack

317
00:13:40,744 --> 00:13:43,624
or something, right? Like there's there's other options. And so

318
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,403
I mean, that's one thing like at the, at the CS A

319
00:13:46,554 --> 00:13:50,133
for example, my response to patching servers is like, no,

320
00:13:50,143 --> 00:13:51,804
let's just use platform as a service

321
00:13:52,114 --> 00:13:52,963
like let's just

322
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:53,671
do that.

323
00:13:53,921 --> 00:13:56,130
-- I mean,
-- yeah, you talk about this all the time.

324
00:13:56,221 --> 00:13:57,291
I'm looking at, you know,

325
00:13:57,301 --> 00:14:01,341
all these companies that are worried about fishing and it's like,

326
00:14:01,401 --> 00:14:03,570
and they're talking about fishing training and it's like,

327
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:08,330
-- no, I think the better answer is go by a bunch of hardware tokens
-- that's easy to say.

328
00:14:08,341 --> 00:14:11,940
But now we also have the scale problem of distributing 10,000 hardware tokens.

329
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,310
But you also have the scale problem of trying to teach

330
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,851
a whole bunch of people not to fall for fishing,

331
00:14:15,861 --> 00:14:16,130
which

332
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,960
-- as we've seen does not work
-- well, depends who you ask.

333
00:14:21,369 --> 00:14:24,679
You don't solve world hunger by growing more food.

334
00:14:24,979 --> 00:14:28,799
You solve world hunger through many things like food distribution, food,

335
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:31,409
accessibility, food safety, security.

336
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:35,349
Right? Like it's, it's, it's, it's a lot harder than just like grow more crops.

337
00:14:35,369 --> 00:14:37,729
-- They have to get to the people that need to eat them. Right.
-- Right.

338
00:14:37,739 --> 00:14:41,989
And this is kind of where some of that scale comes, comes back into play, right? Is

339
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:46,099
-- scale is weird and hard and humans are really bad
-- at it

340
00:14:46,229 --> 00:14:48,580
and you get emergent behaviors that nobody expected.

341
00:14:48,619 --> 00:14:48,789
Yeah,

342
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:50,299
that's always one of the other really funny

343
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:51,869
things when you start doing something on a,

344
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,349
on a wider scale,

345
00:14:53,729 --> 00:14:59,570
-- things can get weird. Well,
-- or you get incentives and people start doing things that

346
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:03,510
don't. Oh, ok. It kind of makes sense now in a context of, you know,

347
00:15:03,739 --> 00:15:06,900
1% of people are going to do this to eke out some perceived advantage.

348
00:15:06,909 --> 00:15:09,309
But the problem is 1% at scale is a problem.

349
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,669
-- You know, I mean,
-- that's always one of the things I laugh at is when

350
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:14,830
you're talking about really big numbers

351
00:15:14,969 --> 00:15:20,309
and people they say, oh, it's only 1% 1% of a billion is a lot

352
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:20,799
like

353
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:25,080
you know that, that's 1% of a billion is what? A million

354
00:15:25,229 --> 00:15:26,840
million, no, 10% would be 10 million.

355
00:15:26,849 --> 00:15:29,599
-- Is it, is it,
-- there's 1000 millions in a billion. Math

356
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:30,070
is hard.

357
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,159
Like that's the answer.

358
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,390
But you know what I mean?

359
00:15:33,469 --> 00:15:34,270
It's hard.

360
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,309
It's very hard.

361
00:15:36,219 --> 00:15:37,429
Yeah, I always come back to,

362
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,280
if 1% of people consistently decide to ignore red lights,

363
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,039
what happens to our traffic situation?

364
00:15:43,739 --> 00:15:45,719
And the answer is it falls apart real fast.

365
00:15:45,729 --> 00:15:49,440
The other problem is most people have never dealt with.

366
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:53,150
-- I'm going to say medium scale, let alone large scale.
-- No, I agree.

367
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:55,989
And I think this is especially in security. One of the traps.

368
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,570
I always see, I used to get this actually, when I was at elastic is

369
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:02,479
the elastic stack is a,

370
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:06,250
we'll say large piece of software is the polite way. I'll describe it.

371
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,869
It has a lot of dependencies and we would do our

372
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,270
best to keep track of them and understand what's going on.

373
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,210
But it was, it was um, it was scale right where we were dealing with

374
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:18,359
hundreds of findings on a regular basis.

375
00:16:18,369 --> 00:16:20,849
And so one of the challenges being we have to keep

376
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,200
track of them, we have to understand what are the important ones.

377
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:26,179
What are the less important ones? How do we prioritize this work?

378
00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:27,030
Because

379
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,909
you can't just like start randomly upgrading everything.

380
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:32,570
I mean, it, it explodes, it's just not, it's not practical

381
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,150
and it was funny because

382
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:38,330
I would talk to certain people and they'd say, oh, you have to fix all of these.

383
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:38,859
And it's like,

384
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,369
no, I don't, I, I can't,

385
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:45,619
but even if, even if I had the resources to fix it all, I wouldn't

386
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:49,830
because fixing everything would create more risk than the issues have themselves.

387
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,640
And there were so many people who just like,

388
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,299
they could not wrap their head around it at the end.

389
00:16:53,309 --> 00:16:55,380
It's like it is what it is. It's in your court now.

390
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,299
It's actually worse than that because in, in,

391
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:59,619
even if you took on the task of fixing all this,

392
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,840
imagine if you'd taken half those resources and made the product better.

393
00:17:02,849 --> 00:17:03,219
Right.

394
00:17:03,409 --> 00:17:03,760
That's the thing.

395
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:08,319
It's not if I have the resources to actually like, fix every security problem.

396
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:11,510
Like, basically, if I have the resources to patch every pothole in Edmonton,

397
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,829
I would rather not patch every pothole in Edmonton.

398
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:17,868
-- There's like we could use a new bridge or two and some new roads.
-- Exactly that.

399
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,010
Exactly that. And this is where again, issues of scale start to change.

400
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,020
If you have to fix one security vulnerability, great.

401
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,479
That's no big deal. Fix one thing.

402
00:17:26,608 --> 00:17:29,000
Yeah. Log for j heroic effort. It can be made.

403
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,540
But now what happens when you have to do that?

404
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,359
-- Log
-- for Jay is a very bad example.

405
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,180
It's a great example because

406
00:17:35,479 --> 00:17:38,280
you can do one log for J a year

407
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,619
emergency response and probably not burn your people out.

408
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,719
But what happens when that's a quarterly issue?

409
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:46,219
Yeah, more than one of those a year would be terrible.

410
00:17:47,449 --> 00:17:49,469
But I mean, so, actually no, in all seriousness,

411
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:52,040
I think log for J is a good example because

412
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,739
I talked to many people that were not having to scan

413
00:17:56,849 --> 00:18:00,599
tens of machines or hundreds of machines or even thousands of machines,

414
00:18:00,609 --> 00:18:04,810
they had tens or hundreds of thousands of instances where they had to

415
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:07,329
figure out do I have log for J on this system somewhere?

416
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:09,829
And that becomes an enormous challenge.

417
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,550
Like if I said, Kurt scan your system for log for J

418
00:18:13,949 --> 00:18:17,390
in like five minutes, you'd probably come back and say I didn't find it or, oh,

419
00:18:17,589 --> 00:18:18,920
I found it over here, right?

420
00:18:19,209 --> 00:18:22,280
But if I said Kurt here are 10,000 computers,

421
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:25,239
-- scan them for log for J
-- and half of them are not

422
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:26,880
really well maintained.

423
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:31,000
We just had that like there's a CS a member that literally is like

424
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,510
we started scanning all of our infrastructure more aggressively

425
00:18:34,689 --> 00:18:35,189
and

426
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:36,569
like RCM,

427
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,040
like basically poop the bed with all the reports and alerts.

428
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,170
I have no doubt

429
00:18:41,489 --> 00:18:42,910
because again, they're working at a, you know,

430
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,949
they're working in that 100,000 plus scale.

431
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:45,469
And it's like,

432
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,060
and that probably generated

433
00:18:48,219 --> 00:18:50,770
thousands of events per system

434
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:56,180
times. Well, no, thousands of events per system times, thousands of systems.

435
00:18:56,189 --> 00:18:57,540
Now it's a big number

436
00:18:58,099 --> 00:18:59,979
and it's literally what do you do with that it's

437
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,739
-- well.
-- Ok. No, I mean, this is actually this is a good example.

438
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,459
Let, let's dive into this space.

439
00:19:04,469 --> 00:19:08,819
This is where I think SIMS are a great example is in the old days

440
00:19:08,989 --> 00:19:11,300
and old days being like five years ago, you know,

441
00:19:11,459 --> 00:19:14,939
in the old days back when I was young, you would deploy

442
00:19:15,292 --> 00:19:19,623
a SIM system is security, what is it? Security information, event monitoring

443
00:19:20,042 --> 00:19:23,282
and the intent is you collect all this information

444
00:19:23,402 --> 00:19:25,983
and then you can detect when there's maybe an attack

445
00:19:25,993 --> 00:19:28,422
or you can look for a strange behavior or whatever,

446
00:19:28,432 --> 00:19:29,792
you can kind of build these rules.

447
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:32,833
But basically the way it had to work is you would deploy your SIM,

448
00:19:32,883 --> 00:19:35,552
you deploy all these agents, information would come back,

449
00:19:35,562 --> 00:19:38,353
-- alerts would fire and humans would go look at the alerts,
-- right,

450
00:19:38,812 --> 00:19:40,142
and investigate and deal with it.

451
00:19:40,162 --> 00:19:41,713
And even when even at the beginning,

452
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:43,753
humans couldn't really do this because you were gener

453
00:19:44,095 --> 00:19:48,566
probably 100 alerts per person working on your security team.

454
00:19:48,615 --> 00:19:52,806
I would say it's probably an a, an optimistic estimate now,

455
00:19:53,255 --> 00:19:55,946
in most infrastructures just because of their scale, you know,

456
00:19:55,956 --> 00:19:57,946
I'm gonna say the word scale as much as I can, I guess.

457
00:19:58,005 --> 00:20:00,365
But in most infrastructures because of their scale,

458
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:04,426
these si environments are actually generating millions

459
00:20:04,556 --> 00:20:06,306
of events per day

460
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:09,586
and no one has a security team of 100,000 people.

461
00:20:09,595 --> 00:20:12,526
I mean, even if you had the budget, you couldn't find them.

462
00:20:12,949 --> 00:20:17,530
And so we reached this point where now we, you, you kind of have two choices.

463
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,060
You can either just turn off a whole bunch of alerts, which

464
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:24,560
maybe that's probably not a good idea. I mean, why do you have this

465
00:20:24,719 --> 00:20:28,189
or now we have to start thinking bigger where we can say,

466
00:20:28,199 --> 00:20:31,849
how can we let the robots do the easy work?

467
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:35,739
And how can we go from a million alerts to here are 30 alerts.

468
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,469
A human needs to look at every day.

469
00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:40,469
I would slightly disagree and say again, it goes back to you,

470
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:43,099
look at even higher level strategic and policy of,

471
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,449
you know, do we have to be even doing this

472
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:50,349
or is there other ways to accomplish this or are there other technologies or other,

473
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:51,310
you know, methods?

474
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:54,670
-- You
-- need to do it? You're talking out of your backside on that one.

475
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,119
It definitely needs to be done.

476
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:56,739
No, no, no.

477
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,510
What I mean is, well, for example,

478
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,589
do we need to run on premises email or can we just outsource it to Google?

479
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:04,630
That has nothing to do with the SIM generating a million alerts per day?

480
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,709
Well, but at some point, you can start to get rid of,

481
00:21:07,354 --> 00:21:10,484
-- you know, some
-- of it. But even even when you offload this stuff, Kurt,

482
00:21:10,675 --> 00:21:14,844
you have connectors because you need events from your email system.

483
00:21:14,854 --> 00:21:17,314
You have to know where is the email coming from?

484
00:21:17,324 --> 00:21:21,165
When do I see logins coming from Moscow, Russia. You know what I mean?

485
00:21:21,175 --> 00:21:22,704
Like you need this information

486
00:21:23,084 --> 00:21:24,574
but I mean, ii I

487
00:21:24,714 --> 00:21:27,944
think part of the challenge is a lot of security people

488
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,839
see something and then they try and solve that exact same thing.

489
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:34,660
They don't ever do sort of a root cause it's human

490
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,349
nature and I don't mean a root cause analysis and like,

491
00:21:37,699 --> 00:21:38,020
you know,

492
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,939
exactly how did this feel but more of a root cause analysis of like

493
00:21:40,949 --> 00:21:42,920
kind of how did we get here and do we need to be here?

494
00:21:43,699 --> 00:21:44,670
I mean, some of it,

495
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,030
I think you oversimplify this matter all the time

496
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,760
and I'm not going to entertain it right now.

497
00:21:48,979 --> 00:21:49,359
Well,

498
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:53,040
I'm going to point out that the COVID is a forcing function to move

499
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:56,650
people to the cloud has resulted in a lot of old it getting binned.

500
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,959
Oh, sure. And that's a good thing. I think, I think it was going to happen anyway.

501
00:21:59,969 --> 00:22:03,880
It's just, it got accelerated, which is 15 years. But now we have a new problem.

502
00:22:03,965 --> 00:22:05,906
We had a bunch of stuff on prem,

503
00:22:05,995 --> 00:22:10,046
we had a certain amount of insight into that gear and infrastructure.

504
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:11,345
Now it's somewhere else.

505
00:22:11,355 --> 00:22:15,176
I still need some of that insight because like one of my favorite examples is,

506
00:22:15,196 --> 00:22:20,265
let's say you have a user that logs in from San Francisco,

507
00:22:20,276 --> 00:22:23,946
California in the US and then four minutes later logs in

508
00:22:24,232 --> 00:22:25,972
from ST Petersburg, Russia.

509
00:22:25,982 --> 00:22:26,671
Well, yeah, and that's,

510
00:22:26,682 --> 00:22:29,141
that's one of the classic things when I look at single sign ons

511
00:22:29,352 --> 00:22:35,602
and why a lot of companies kind of don't want to outsource the accounts to say Twitter

512
00:22:35,612 --> 00:22:37,952
or linkedin or Facebook or Google because they

513
00:22:37,962 --> 00:22:39,962
lose that insight and they lose that control.

514
00:22:39,972 --> 00:22:43,212
It's sort of, well, I don't know if your account's been popped or not because I have,

515
00:22:43,222 --> 00:22:44,411
I just see you coming in.

516
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:49,650
Well, it, and here's the funny thing so you can rely on something like Octa, right?

517
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,069
Where Octa logs a bunch of this stuff. But with the way

518
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,930
some of the new single sign on mechanisms work

519
00:22:56,089 --> 00:22:58,170
is you really just need

520
00:22:58,359 --> 00:22:59,010
a cookie

521
00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:02,780
and it contains all the information and you don't necessarily have

522
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:05,959
to ask the the single sign on instance for authentication,

523
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:06,280
right?

524
00:23:06,489 --> 00:23:10,560
And this is where having some of that insight being pulled into like your SIM

525
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:12,319
can make all the difference and this,

526
00:23:12,329 --> 00:23:14,719
but it creates new challenges because now you have to figure

527
00:23:14,729 --> 00:23:17,599
out how do I get this information from the web mail

528
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:18,209
and from

529
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,130
-- github? And then how do I correlate
-- it? The Conditional

530
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:21,459
Act

531
00:23:21,594 --> 00:23:23,454
access control, which is kind of the hot thing now, right?

532
00:23:23,464 --> 00:23:26,275
Like for example, it works great within the Azure ecosystem.

533
00:23:26,285 --> 00:23:29,354
But the minute you want to talk to a server outside of Azure, it's kind of like, well,

534
00:23:29,364 --> 00:23:30,714
-- how do you get the data to and from
-- it?

535
00:23:30,895 --> 00:23:32,734
All right, you need to explain what

536
00:23:32,974 --> 00:23:35,244
-- ABAC is because I bet a lot of people don't know.
-- Ok. So

537
00:23:35,385 --> 00:23:37,364
ABAC is essentially, well, like you said, Bob,

538
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:42,935
the salesman always logs in from an iphone and an apple air from, you know,

539
00:23:42,944 --> 00:23:43,814
the Western US.

540
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:46,410
So if he suddenly logs in from China,

541
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,849
did he travel there or is that an attack, you know,

542
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:54,410
or things like looking at access patterns time of day, the devices being used,

543
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:58,630
the software being used, basically looking at as much data as possible

544
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:01,640
to create sort of a risk assessment of that event.

545
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,140
Well, and,

546
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,209
and then you can trigger kind of behaviors based on that

547
00:24:05,219 --> 00:24:08,619
where you could say if Bob logs in from China,

548
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,130
just no

549
00:24:09,245 --> 00:24:13,666
deny. Or you could say if Bob logs in from the east coast of the United States,

550
00:24:13,845 --> 00:24:17,546
then I want you to make him give a second factor, right?

551
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:20,056
Or, or you could even set things up. Like I want,

552
00:24:20,245 --> 00:24:22,605
I want you to have to log in with user name and

553
00:24:22,615 --> 00:24:25,005
password and they give me a second factor and then I'm gonna,

554
00:24:25,015 --> 00:24:27,395
you know, ping your phone and you need to, you know what I mean?

555
00:24:27,406 --> 00:24:28,186
And you can start

556
00:24:28,475 --> 00:24:29,745
looking at the data,

557
00:24:29,796 --> 00:24:32,385
looking at the various events and attributes and

558
00:24:32,395 --> 00:24:34,145
everything and you can start making in intelligence

559
00:24:34,251 --> 00:24:35,391
decisions. But again,

560
00:24:35,572 --> 00:24:38,791
this is a problem at scale where if I tell you this,

561
00:24:39,182 --> 00:24:42,232
you could think about, OK, maybe I could do this for one or two people.

562
00:24:42,241 --> 00:24:44,222
But now imagine you have an environment where you

563
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:46,432
have a million logins an hour coming in.

564
00:24:46,442 --> 00:24:48,751
How do you possibly correlate all of these

565
00:24:48,761 --> 00:24:50,741
things together and deal with them appropriately?

566
00:24:50,751 --> 00:24:54,232
So the data like within Azure, you can do this within Azure.

567
00:24:54,241 --> 00:24:56,751
But the minute you have a system outside of Azure,

568
00:24:56,881 --> 00:24:58,592
how do you get the data to and from it?

569
00:24:58,832 --> 00:24:59,151
And

570
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:03,469
the answer is it's complicated, which is a classic way of saying is like, yeah,

571
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:05,310
we can build a custom solution that will do that,

572
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,219
which is

573
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:07,949
like the ultimate, in my opinion,

574
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:11,229
the ultimate software kind of useless answer because it's completely true.

575
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:14,359
Like yes, we can build software that will do anything. Good luck with that.

576
00:25:14,369 --> 00:25:18,709
Well, if you have the right people and the resources and the time,

577
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:19,430
I mean,

578
00:25:19,729 --> 00:25:23,430
it always, it always annoys me when people are like, oh just write a script to do that.

579
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:24,589
No,

580
00:25:24,729 --> 00:25:26,729
no, I will not be writing a script to do that.

581
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:31,760
And, and again, I, I think, I mean, this is, this fit fits in completely where

582
00:25:31,949 --> 00:25:33,780
if I have a computer in my basement

583
00:25:33,939 --> 00:25:36,650
and I just need to do something a couple of times, I can write a script,

584
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,329
I can run the script and we're done right?

585
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:41,930
But now if I have an infrastructure where I have 7 million containers running on it,

586
00:25:41,939 --> 00:25:46,194
and I need to do something half of those containers like that's not a script,

587
00:25:46,334 --> 00:25:49,564
I need to rethink everything I know

588
00:25:49,665 --> 00:25:52,464
about dealing with this infrastructure and obviously

589
00:25:52,474 --> 00:25:54,204
containers are supposed to be immutable,

590
00:25:54,214 --> 00:25:56,665
which I know they're not in many instances.

591
00:25:56,675 --> 00:25:57,484
But you know what I mean?

592
00:25:57,775 --> 00:25:58,204
It's

593
00:25:59,395 --> 00:26:00,234
so,

594
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:00,829
oh,

595
00:26:00,969 --> 00:26:02,910
this is the world we live in now.

596
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,530
Well, no, I mean, I worked with these products.

597
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,270
I read that like satellite and sand that were meant

598
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,550
to control tens of thousands of machines and it's like

599
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:13,699
-- this is complicated. Who knew?
-- No, I know. I know. I mean, I remember

600
00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:16,790
one of my favorite examples of this is

601
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:19,030
I had a friend who worked at Google.

602
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,349
This was back in the very early days, like early 2000, right?

603
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,839
The 2000 knots. Was that what we call it?

604
00:26:26,689 --> 00:26:29,189
Anyway? The good old days

605
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,780
I remember someone was talking about

606
00:26:31,979 --> 00:26:34,619
having 1000 computers in their server room

607
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:39,219
and everyone around was like, oh, wow, 1000 and the Google guy just smiled

608
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,569
and I looked at him and I said, how many do you have?

609
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:43,770
And he said there's a lot more zeros than that.

610
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,010
And it's like,

611
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:45,569
I

612
00:26:45,859 --> 00:26:48,569
can't imagine what it looks like. Now, you know,

613
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:50,599
-- I
-- just, I, you know, again that,

614
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,729
that Microsoft earnings call where they refer to

615
00:26:52,739 --> 00:26:54,449
their data centers and data center miles.

616
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,569
It's like Star Trek kilo quads.

617
00:26:57,895 --> 00:27:01,005
-- It's a bunch of stuff.
-- Wait, what is a data center? Mile?

618
00:27:01,074 --> 00:27:02,405
It's a mile of data center.

619
00:27:02,494 --> 00:27:04,765
-- Oh, like
-- the building is a, 00, I see.

620
00:27:04,775 --> 00:27:07,364
They're measuring as if all the buildings were lined up.

621
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:09,604
How many miles long would it be?

622
00:27:09,614 --> 00:27:09,935
-- You
-- know,

623
00:27:09,944 --> 00:27:11,925
Amazon's putting in that new availability zone down

624
00:27:11,935 --> 00:27:13,755
in Calgary and they're spending 4 billion bucks

625
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,905
and it'll be three physical locations and everybody's

626
00:27:15,915 --> 00:27:18,204
like losing their mind about the $4 billion.

627
00:27:18,214 --> 00:27:18,604
And I'm like,

628
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,380
no, a data center,

629
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,660
like a modern data center basically costs a billion

630
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:25,319
bucks and times three plus some other stuff.

631
00:27:25,329 --> 00:27:29,270
-- Yeah, $4 billion.
-- And in Canada think of how the money they'll save on cooling.

632
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,229
-- Can they just like, open the window or something? I would hope.
-- Oh, no.

633
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:33,630
So what they do now is the,

634
00:27:33,949 --> 00:27:37,270
the chilling units will essentially, they run a, like, for example,

635
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,250
they can run a Glycol loop for the coolant.

636
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:39,949
Right. And

637
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:40,869
yeah, and in winter

638
00:27:40,974 --> 00:27:43,305
-- just run the Glycol loop and they
-- don't really

639
00:27:43,604 --> 00:27:44,755
have to beat the air.

640
00:27:44,885 --> 00:27:45,204
Yeah.

641
00:27:45,324 --> 00:27:46,234
But no,

642
00:27:46,244 --> 00:27:49,344
there's not actually not that much savings on cooling because you

643
00:27:49,354 --> 00:27:51,224
still have to clean the air and filter it and everything.

644
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:52,175
Well. Right. Yeah.

645
00:27:52,675 --> 00:27:54,905
You know, you can't just be shoving random.

646
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:56,905
Of course, of course, that's probably fair.

647
00:27:56,915 --> 00:27:59,454
I suppose you're still running the fans, you're still doing all of that.

648
00:27:59,464 --> 00:28:01,005
The more to the point is,

649
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:02,714
you know, that gives them,

650
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,689
you know, sub

651
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,339
millisecond access now to Western Canada because, you know,

652
00:28:07,349 --> 00:28:10,459
the only other data Amazon are in, what is it?

653
00:28:10,469 --> 00:28:12,640
I want to say like near Montreal or somewhere over there

654
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:15,880
in earthquake prone regions.

655
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:17,060
Montreal, no,

656
00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:19,900
Montreal doesn't have earthquakes but Vancouver gets earthquakes. Right.

657
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:22,060
That's why they probably didn't put it in Vancouver and they put it

658
00:28:22,069 --> 00:28:26,699
in Calgary where you have literally hailstorms and that's easy to engineer for.

659
00:28:26,729 --> 00:28:29,359
-- Well, and
-- actually Calgary is really close to the US also.

660
00:28:29,369 --> 00:28:31,000
So I bet you could leverage that

661
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,619
I could, I could host

662
00:28:32,719 --> 00:28:36,180
pirate content in Canada now and the US government can't touch me

663
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:37,579
anyway.

664
00:28:37,699 --> 00:28:39,300
Yeah, Alberta is wonderful. We have zero

665
00:28:39,459 --> 00:28:42,579
seismic issues. We basically have hail, the occasional tornado

666
00:28:42,719 --> 00:28:43,589
and snowstorms.

667
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,290
Oh, you get tornadoes? I didn't know that.

668
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:48,420
Yeah, snowstorms is an understatement, I think.

669
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,180
-- Uh,
-- well, no, it's, it's funny because it's not as bad as people imagine it because

670
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:56,199
the, the mountains eat up most of the snow. Like, we're in a rain shadow.

671
00:28:56,719 --> 00:28:57,020
So,

672
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,739
it's not like you guys with the living next

673
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,250
to a lake and getting all that humidity and,

674
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,079
-- like, I'm
-- on the good side of the lake.

675
00:29:02,089 --> 00:29:04,880
It's the people on the other side of the lake that have the trouble.

676
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:09,439
-- Like, if we got a foot of snow that would be like a world ending event here.
-- Oh, really?

677
00:29:09,449 --> 00:29:13,770
Whoa. We get like, two or three inches of snow but it's minus 40 for a week or a month.

678
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,239
And it's,

679
00:29:15,449 --> 00:29:16,030
it's, it's,

680
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:20,599
yeah, when it's minus 40. Well, it's, it's just minus 40 it sucks to go outside.

681
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,079
I've, I've been in it a couple of times and it,

682
00:29:23,089 --> 00:29:25,189
like your face burns when you leave the building.

683
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:26,880
It's not, it's not, it's not good.

684
00:29:27,449 --> 00:29:30,430
Anyway, we should call this one man now that we're talking about the weather,

685
00:29:30,439 --> 00:29:31,719
like two old men.

686
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:34,140
So what I think getting back to

687
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:38,790
scale the issue is most people have never encountered it and they don't

688
00:29:39,199 --> 00:29:42,339
like at scale. You have issues. Like, do we have enough parking for the analysts?

689
00:29:42,469 --> 00:29:42,890
Do we have enough

690
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:43,439
to? How

691
00:29:43,569 --> 00:29:44,709
many toilets does your building?

692
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,800
That's my favorite.

693
00:29:46,469 --> 00:29:47,010
My, my,

694
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,140
my all time favorite was the Alberta government had their

695
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:52,199
alternate site of government was a building called Government House.

696
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:53,189
And it's a lovely,

697
00:29:53,199 --> 00:29:55,709
beautifully historical old building next to the

698
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:57,699
Royal or the former Royal Alberta Museum.

699
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:01,410
And for example, it's got this mahogany table that had to be craned in, you know,

700
00:30:01,439 --> 00:30:02,119
100 years ago.

701
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,500
It's amazing building.

702
00:30:03,739 --> 00:30:06,630
And I think it's got like four toilets and about 20 phone lines.

703
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:07,050
And I'm like,

704
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,900
you're going to run the Alberta government out of there with 20 phone lines,

705
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,489
just plant some bushes out back.

706
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,239
It'll be fine.

707
00:30:12,739 --> 00:30:13,680
You know, it's

708
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:14,670
like

709
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,550
I remember talking to the person. They're like, what do you mean?

710
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,109
-- I'm like, there's just not enough phone lines
-- or four toilets.

711
00:30:20,859 --> 00:30:21,280
You know,

712
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:26,390
my house has 34 people live here. We run out of toilets on a regular basis.

713
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:27,270
Like

714
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:31,670
four people, man, I got two teenagers. They spend too much time in the bathroom, but

715
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:32,640
like

716
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,829
when I had my basement remodeled, I'm like, put a toilet down here.

717
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:37,359
Like that's the only thing I care about.

718
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,439
-- Yeah,
-- I'm actually thinking of

719
00:30:38,555 --> 00:30:41,474
a little bit of remodeling here in my office space and putting in a bathroom.

720
00:30:41,484 --> 00:30:42,454
Seriously, man,

721
00:30:42,704 --> 00:30:45,935
actually being, being, having your office next to a bathroom is lovely.

722
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:49,055
I'll say because like a lazy slob, you barely have to go anywhere anyway.

723
00:30:49,064 --> 00:30:52,614
