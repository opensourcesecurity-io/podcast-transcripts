Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast.

1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,119
This is the Running in Place episode with myself,

2
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,699
Kurt Siefried and my partner and Thought Crime.

3
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,289
-- Josh Pressers.
-- What? Running in place? Yeah,

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,139
treadmills

5
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:18,350
also a reference to Alice in Wonderland.

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,100
Right. The Red Queen. You have to run as fast as you can just to stay in place.

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:22,559
And that's

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,579
honestly how the last few weeks have felt.

9
00:00:25,069 --> 00:00:29,979
That is my life right now. I'm, I'm running in place and falling behind.

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,340
It's frustrating.

11
00:00:31,389 --> 00:00:31,590
The,

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,380
the one thing I've always noticed with that is

13
00:00:33,389 --> 00:00:36,520
when those weeks or months happen is that a

14
00:00:36,529 --> 00:00:38,259
lot of the stuff that falls by the wayside

15
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,049
turns out you didn't really actually have to do.

16
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:45,189
I have been culling tasks for years.

17
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,880
Like I did recently spend two hours outside on a step ladder,

18
00:00:48,889 --> 00:00:51,840
chipping ice out of my gutters because they were solidly full

19
00:00:51,849 --> 00:00:53,080
of ice in the front of the house because it,

20
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,000
you know, the sun hits it, it melts in the evening

21
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,709
-- but, and then just freezes overnight.
-- Right?

22
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,180
-- That sounds like an incredibly dangerous task.
-- It's actually really easy.

23
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:04,589
You just a hammer and a screwdriver and you smash it up

24
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,169
in the little pieces and pull it out of the gutter.

25
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,349
-- Yeah.
-- You're not filling me with confidence

26
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:08,769
that

27
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:10,550
I own a really good ladder.

28
00:01:10,919 --> 00:01:13,510
Like I, I spent good money on a good ladder.

29
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:15,389
That's not wobbly like it, trust me because, yeah,

30
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,160
I don't want to be up on a wobbly ladder and fall 10 ft and break my

31
00:01:18,305 --> 00:01:23,765
-- everything 10
-- feet. My roof is probably 40 ft in the air.

32
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:27,225
-- Oh, yeah. No, my house is relatively.
-- I would definitely not

33
00:01:27,236 --> 00:01:28,585
do that. Yeah. No, no.

34
00:01:28,596 --> 00:01:30,225
With 40 ft, I'd hire somebody

35
00:01:30,496 --> 00:01:33,295
or, you know, install one of those electric heaters for your gutter to keep it.

36
00:01:33,305 --> 00:01:37,195
I just let my gutters fill with ice and I YOLO it

37
00:01:37,295 --> 00:01:38,466
-- so it's fine.
-- Yeah.

38
00:01:38,475 --> 00:01:42,251
-- But then you get ice stands and you get your roof pushes up and
-- it's fine. It's fine.

39
00:01:42,262 --> 00:01:43,152
Everything's fine. Kirk,

40
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:44,061
it's fine.

41
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:45,132
It's all fine.

42
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:48,291
But, yeah. No. So I recently got a treadmill and it was actually really

43
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:51,162
interesting experience. What always gets me.

44
00:01:51,171 --> 00:01:55,421
Now when I buy big kind of complicated machines that I'm also expected

45
00:01:55,431 --> 00:01:59,082
to partially assemble myself is how much easier and better it's gotten.

46
00:01:59,092 --> 00:02:01,262
Partly because, you know, they just, they don't want to hear from you.

47
00:02:01,272 --> 00:02:02,861
-- I
-- mean, that's pretty fair.

48
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:03,781
So

49
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:05,980
I will,

50
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:11,149
I will prewarn the listeners that Kurt decided we should discuss his treadmill,

51
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,740
endeavors as the security topic of the week.

52
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,460
And I'm as enthralled as you are as to how this is going to

53
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,779
work out because he doesn't tell me how this is going to go.

54
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:24,380
-- So, here we are,
-- there's a lot of things we,

55
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:26,619
in the security industry could learn from these people,

56
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,339
but there's also a lot of things we just,

57
00:02:29,339 --> 00:02:32,919
how do I put it nicely we can't do or what we do do. But,

58
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:36,070
you know, like there's a lot of passing the buck for sure in this,

59
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,910
in the security world or in the treadmill world.

60
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:43,679
-- That is fair.
-- Yeah, because like, it's right now it is my favorite.

61
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:47,470
I love the important precautions. This treadmill came with. There's

62
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:47,729
a,

63
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,240
there's 31 of them.

64
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,820
I'm not going to, I'm not even going to come close to reading all of them,

65
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,610
but only 31 only 31.

66
00:02:53,619 --> 00:02:54,000
But I mean,

67
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:56,720
it's things like it is the responsibility of the owner to ensure that

68
00:02:56,729 --> 00:02:58,399
all users of this treadmill are adequately

69
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,309
informed of all warnings and precautions.

70
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,449
I mean, that seems pretty fair, but there's 31 of these and then there's things like

71
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,399
use the treadmill only as described in this manual,

72
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,970
which leads me to wonder what have people done with and to

73
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:14,300
and on their treadmills that weren't sort of normal treadmill activities.

74
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:16,039
-- Let's say,
-- haven't you seen this

75
00:03:16,145 --> 00:03:16,166
of

76
00:03:16,436 --> 00:03:18,535
people with treadmills on the internet?

77
00:03:18,546 --> 00:03:21,585
-- There's some hilariously awesome videos
-- like doing the

78
00:03:21,595 --> 00:03:23,126
ball bounce things and stuff like that.

79
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:25,615
The ok, go video, right. That ok go treadmill video.

80
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,975
There's, there's that one but then there's also,

81
00:03:28,985 --> 00:03:31,065
I've seen people where they put like,

82
00:03:31,076 --> 00:03:33,735
food on it and they hold their mouth open while the food.

83
00:03:33,805 --> 00:03:37,145
But it's pretty sweet. There's some cool videos. I'm trying to think.

84
00:03:37,156 --> 00:03:38,416
There's some other really funny ones.

85
00:03:38,425 --> 00:03:42,406
I've seen where people tried to put a bicycle on it and they

86
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:45,151
-- like,
-- of course, like two treadmills for that.

87
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:48,151
I mean, I guess you'd have to one run in reverse because they

88
00:03:49,222 --> 00:03:49,352
just

89
00:03:49,561 --> 00:03:49,712
put it.

90
00:03:50,742 --> 00:03:53,281
Well, no, no, no. But most treadmills aren't long enough to put a bike on.

91
00:03:53,292 --> 00:03:54,511
Well, no, because they put it on,

92
00:03:54,522 --> 00:03:56,572
they get on the bike and then they fall off immediately.

93
00:03:56,582 --> 00:03:59,781
I mean, that's the only reason the videos on youtube, if it works, if it worked,

94
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:00,792
no one would care.

95
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:04,332
Well, I imagine a unicycle you'd have more luck, shorter wheelbase.

96
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,391
I don't know. Like,

97
00:04:06,602 --> 00:04:07,712
I have no idea.

98
00:04:07,722 --> 00:04:08,912
But the point is, I mean,

99
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:12,231
there's also the Survivor bias of things like treadmills where you

100
00:04:12,457 --> 00:04:15,688
hear about the really dumb stuff that people got hurt doing.

101
00:04:16,338 --> 00:04:18,577
So, these silly legal things.

102
00:04:18,588 --> 00:04:18,747
Well,

103
00:04:18,757 --> 00:04:23,287
like this keep Children under age of 13 and pets away from the treadmill at all times.

104
00:04:23,298 --> 00:04:24,328
That seems fair.

105
00:04:24,608 --> 00:04:27,388
But like the things in my basement I'm supposed to, like, put, you know,

106
00:04:27,398 --> 00:04:29,738
like construction fencing around it or something.

107
00:04:29,747 --> 00:04:31,768
-- No, like
-- none of this is real.

108
00:04:31,778 --> 00:04:32,528
It's, I don't just,

109
00:04:32,537 --> 00:04:34,877
so when you try to sue them someday they can say

110
00:04:34,888 --> 00:04:37,088
it was in the phone book of instructions we gave you.

111
00:04:37,097 --> 00:04:38,717
You didn't follow them so, too bad.

112
00:04:38,727 --> 00:04:39,687
-- It's not our
-- problem,

113
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:41,523
which is something in the software industry we've been

114
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:43,223
doing forever and getting away with it seems,

115
00:04:43,253 --> 00:04:43,734
I mean,

116
00:04:44,454 --> 00:04:48,324
until people, you know, freak out about whatever the given flavor of the week is.

117
00:04:48,403 --> 00:04:49,803
Yeah, that's pretty common.

118
00:04:49,813 --> 00:04:54,674
And then, but the best part is as long as you can weather the storm for a week,

119
00:04:54,683 --> 00:04:57,743
most people move on to the next thing and then you're fine again.

120
00:04:58,873 --> 00:05:00,454
Yeah. It's kind of just how it's worked.

121
00:05:00,463 --> 00:05:02,653
But in fairness they did do something that we talked about earlier.

122
00:05:02,664 --> 00:05:04,984
That is pretty awesome. Which is when I was assembling the treadmill.

123
00:05:04,993 --> 00:05:08,424
It comes obviously with a bunch of like nuts and bolts and screws and stuff

124
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,160
fasteners basically.

125
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:14,489
And they're on like this heavy piece of cardboard that's been like shrink wracked,

126
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,019
laminated and all the parts.

127
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:17,089
There's like, step one,

128
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,480
step one is labeled on the cardboard with like a line

129
00:05:19,489 --> 00:05:21,369
around it with the parts for step one and then like,

130
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,420
step two, same thing.

131
00:05:22,429 --> 00:05:23,019
There's like,

132
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,880
you know, the eight bolts, the eight thing.

133
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,119
And yeah, and I was just like, because I'm looking at it, I'm like, oh,

134
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,899
like there's a lot of like, I'm gonna have to find the pieces and then I'm like, oh, no,

135
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,010
it says step one, step two.

136
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:34,380
I look at the manual. It's like OK. This is awesome.

137
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,480
This straight up is just, and it literally,

138
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,670
yeah, the whole thing took me about, I don't know about an hour to assemble

139
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,450
in total by myself, right?

140
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:44,399
It would have been way faster with two people, you know,

141
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,420
somebody to hold it while I'm trying to like fit the

142
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:47,570
Yeah.

143
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:48,260
No, it was,

144
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:51,640
I I've literally had more trouble assembling IKEA furniture than this thing,

145
00:05:52,739 --> 00:05:52,940
right?

146
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,859
Because I do furniture has that bad habit of using those

147
00:05:54,869 --> 00:05:57,100
wooden pigs that you got to be really careful tapping in.

148
00:05:57,109 --> 00:06:00,239
If you overdrive them, you know, you, you've just buggered up the whole thing.

149
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,859
Yeah, I've been there.

150
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:05,119
Yeah. And you can't fix it once you split particle board.

151
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:09,720
This is an interesting problem and I see this in security all the time where

152
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,079
there's, you know, there's the old argument of you can have security or usability

153
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,429
and usability will always

154
00:06:15,545 --> 00:06:18,205
-- win because security. Well, that's
-- what people want.

155
00:06:18,256 --> 00:06:19,085
Exactly.

156
00:06:19,096 --> 00:06:22,566
That's what they're buying your product for, not for security in most cases.

157
00:06:22,575 --> 00:06:26,246
And I think this kind of put together industry. So

158
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:29,936
I remember probably 20 or 30 years ago

159
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:33,365
when put together stuff was kind of becoming the new thing

160
00:06:33,536 --> 00:06:38,446
and it was a nightmare. It was really bad. So I remember I, when I was in

161
00:06:38,592 --> 00:06:42,052
high school I was probably 1617 give or take.

162
00:06:42,062 --> 00:06:46,082
I went and worked at a store that sold, it was like a,

163
00:06:46,092 --> 00:06:49,691
like a department style store where they had all different things.

164
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:53,492
And I was in the hardware department and furniture was part of that group.

165
00:06:53,502 --> 00:06:58,011
And so the put together furniture was our group's responsibility to do.

166
00:06:58,022 --> 00:07:01,571
And I remember the lady who was in charge of it would

167
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,549
bless her heart. She would start putting it together.

168
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:08,910
And inevitably, every time be like whoever was working, she'd say you finish this.

169
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,179
I give up and it was,

170
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:13,600
and the instructions were so bad.

171
00:07:13,609 --> 00:07:16,470
I remember usually we'd look at the picture and we just

172
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,350
do our best to put things in the right place.

173
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:20,190
So it looked like the picture and it was,

174
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:22,589
if anyone actually tried to use this furniture,

175
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,899
it would have collapsed immediately because it was a bunch of

176
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,829
high school kids who had no idea what they were doing,

177
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,470
you know, not putting it together correctly.

178
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,670
-- Plus
-- you're putting something together that's

179
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:32,364
been partially put together and we're,

180
00:07:32,915 --> 00:07:33,244
you know, we

181
00:07:33,765 --> 00:07:34,394
skipped

182
00:07:34,885 --> 00:07:35,075
or

183
00:07:35,635 --> 00:07:35,704
like

184
00:07:35,945 --> 00:07:37,345
that's what always gets me with Lego. Right.

185
00:07:37,355 --> 00:07:40,165
When my one kid is assembling Lego, he'll like, oh, this doesn't work.

186
00:07:40,174 --> 00:07:43,855
-- I immediately flip back eight pages and start from there.
-- Exactly.

187
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,084
That's exactly right.

188
00:07:45,095 --> 00:07:45,964
A friend of mine, you know,

189
00:07:45,975 --> 00:07:48,045
she made her little street sweeper and she's like the little Lego

190
00:07:48,054 --> 00:07:50,065
man doesn't fit in and she's getting all annoyed and I like,

191
00:07:50,075 --> 00:07:52,584
look at it and I look at the picture and I look at it and I look at the picture

192
00:07:52,695 --> 00:07:53,234
and then I like,

193
00:07:53,244 --> 00:07:56,744
move the little steering wheel forwards where it is on the picture and I'm, like,

194
00:07:56,755 --> 00:07:58,964
-- poop and he goes
-- in defense of the Children.

195
00:07:59,054 --> 00:08:00,845
I do that all the time too.

196
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,679
You get to a step and it's just like this part doesn't fit.

197
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:04,579
And then you, like, look at, you,

198
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:07,320
look at the picture and it's like something is subtly different.

199
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:09,190
But, and then you're like, yeah, you flip back like 5,

200
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,980
10 pages and start doing your forensic investigation.

201
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:12,779
-- Right.
-- Right.

202
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:15,380
And although I feel like even LEGO,

203
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,970
I don't feel like it's as difficult as it used to be.

204
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,059
When

205
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,859
-- was young, the
-- instructions are way better.

206
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:22,059
And what I actually,

207
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:25,149
and this is going to show my age and my get off my lawn is almost all the sets.

208
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,179
-- Now come with that bs orange crowbar piece.
-- Oh my goodness.

209
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:32,989
That is the most amazing tool I've ever used. It. Lets you take the Lego pieces apart.

210
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,789
You can use your damn teeth like the rest of us.

211
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,099
I, I get,

212
00:08:36,109 --> 00:08:41,020
don't laugh like I have my old Lego that my parents have in

213
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:44,880
their basement has teeth marks all over the pieces because of me.

214
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,349
Right. Yeah, exactly. I'm like I was some sort of animal. No, man,

215
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,840
this is, this is what progress looks like and this is even I, I

216
00:08:51,994 --> 00:08:54,155
I'm going to frame this in the context of security.

217
00:08:54,164 --> 00:08:56,945
No, I will give you that orange piece makes lifting pieces a million times. I

218
00:08:57,224 --> 00:09:00,405
mean, and you think you look at a lot of security

219
00:09:00,635 --> 00:09:03,655
and I feel like we're still prying pieces off with our,

220
00:09:03,664 --> 00:09:07,294
-- with our teeth instead of
-- that's assuming they weren't glued on

221
00:09:07,474 --> 00:09:08,445
by the vendor.

222
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,380
Yeah, sometimes, sometimes.

223
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:13,479
And I mean, so part of this too though, and this is,

224
00:09:13,489 --> 00:09:15,510
this is actually something I'm dealing with right now and I was,

225
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,799
I was complaining to you before I hit record is I am running into so many

226
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:24,260
security teams that either have this mindset from

227
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,780
probably the mid two thousands or like,

228
00:09:26,789 --> 00:09:30,340
they, they watched a movie and they wrote down the threats and it's,

229
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,190
I want to help you, but this isn't real.

230
00:09:34,469 --> 00:09:34,500
I

231
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,140
get this all the time,

232
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:40,453
you know, because the CS A is 100% cloud based and we get these audit questions.

233
00:09:40,463 --> 00:09:41,182
Number one,

234
00:09:41,353 --> 00:09:44,843
there's a lot of companies that no matter what you are as a vendor,

235
00:09:44,853 --> 00:09:46,052
they basically make the assumption you're

236
00:09:46,062 --> 00:09:48,132
somehow getting and processing their data.

237
00:09:48,143 --> 00:09:51,463
And we're like, right, we're just not, that's not what we do. We don't do that.

238
00:09:51,473 --> 00:09:53,833
And they're like, but you still have to fill out these questions and I'm like,

239
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,453
but they don't make any sense in this context.

240
00:09:55,463 --> 00:09:57,382
We don't back up your data because we don't

241
00:09:57,543 --> 00:09:58,502
have it.

242
00:09:58,703 --> 00:10:01,203
-- Yep. Yep. I see that,
-- you know, what do I say? Or

243
00:10:01,213 --> 00:10:01,543
do

244
00:10:01,903 --> 00:10:02,703
so actually fund

245
00:10:02,806 --> 00:10:08,705
enough. I see both sides of that where I will see someone looking to use

246
00:10:08,835 --> 00:10:11,245
Sass and they send a question that's

247
00:10:11,255 --> 00:10:13,426
clearly for something running on their hardware.

248
00:10:13,616 --> 00:10:16,065
Or I'll see people wanting to run something on their

249
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:18,645
hardware and they send a questionnaire that's clearly for Sass.

250
00:10:18,656 --> 00:10:22,036
And it's like none of these questions matter because

251
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:26,495
I'm not running this computer. Like, is it just encrypted? I don't know. You tell me

252
00:10:26,755 --> 00:10:27,406
your,

253
00:10:27,705 --> 00:10:28,825
your computer.

254
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:29,719
I

255
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:35,059
mean, I know I have TLS to Google and beyond that, I here's their documentation.

256
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:39,179
So actually you remind me too. I, I was talking, I freaking, I was talking to a friend

257
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:43,039
that they'd gotten, they were, they were complaining to me over a beer.

258
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:44,539
They got one of these questionnaires

259
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,169
and there were questions about the data center and like,

260
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,090
how far is it from the nearest body of water?

261
00:10:49,099 --> 00:10:50,729
And what's the elevation and all this? And they're like,

262
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,570
it's freaking Amazon.

263
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:56,119
And they said that the customer they were working with was adamant.

264
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:00,280
They answered the questions and they basically said, I don't know what to do.

265
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:03,190
I'm trying to think like, cause Amazon really,

266
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:07,187
China, they really keep the locations of their data centers kind of on the down low.

267
00:11:08,007 --> 00:11:08,726
And what's interesting,

268
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:10,447
like they just recently opened up a new set of

269
00:11:10,456 --> 00:11:12,896
data centers in Central Canada and by central Canada,

270
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:14,437
they mean like eastern Canada,

271
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,687
but they basically explicitly said,

272
00:11:16,697 --> 00:11:20,517
like they looked at ice storms because these things are out in Quebec and Ontario.

273
00:11:20,716 --> 00:11:21,387
That's the thing.

274
00:11:21,646 --> 00:11:22,096
And they're like,

275
00:11:22,106 --> 00:11:24,197
we have at least one physical path that's

276
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:27,067
100% underground between our data centers for five

277
00:11:27,174 --> 00:11:27,914
stuff like that.

278
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,443
That makes sense though. That's important.

279
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,763
And they talked about literally like we looked at floods, we looked at snowstorms,

280
00:11:33,773 --> 00:11:36,073
we looked at angry moose, whatever, right?

281
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,513
Like they, because Amazon probably has,

282
00:11:38,523 --> 00:11:43,443
if I had to guess a team of 10 to 20 people who think about angry moose,

283
00:11:43,684 --> 00:11:45,653
it's a legitimate concern.

284
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:50,794
Like, if you have an angry moose on your campus in Canada, that's a serious problem.

285
00:11:51,051 --> 00:11:53,921
-- It sounds really funny, but like moose are actually quite dangerous.
-- Well,

286
00:11:54,241 --> 00:11:54,481
yeah,

287
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:56,361
like the thing to keep in mind is basically a

288
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:59,620
moose is about as big as your car and meaner

289
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,630
mean, you know, it's an easier comparison probably is like,

290
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,140
let's say you build a data center where polar bears live.

291
00:12:05,151 --> 00:12:06,731
You would have to be concerned about that.

292
00:12:06,741 --> 00:12:09,111
You can't go outside if there's a polar bear outside.

293
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,570
Well, and even better now we have these things called cinnamon bears,

294
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,560
which are a mixture of polar bear and brown bear.

295
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,630
-- Yeah,
-- that sounds great.

296
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:18,799
Basically all the articles agree. Just, just leave them alone.

297
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:23,400
I would leave any bear alone. I see, regardless of whether black

298
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,169
bears are like they're, they're cuddly friendly, you can feed them and pet them.

299
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,179
No, I live in a place that has black bears

300
00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:32,650
and I do not go near the black bears.

301
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:35,969
I luckily they're, they're generally black bears are very skittish.

302
00:12:35,979 --> 00:12:37,549
And if they see you, they run away.

303
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,010
If they didn't,

304
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:40,219
I would run away.

305
00:12:41,109 --> 00:12:42,090
Plain and simple.

306
00:12:42,099 --> 00:12:46,900
But, but anyway, anyway, they have valid concerns and they're, at the same time,

307
00:12:46,909 --> 00:12:49,169
let's say I put data in Amazon's cloud.

308
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:51,539
I don't even know what data center it's in.

309
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:56,799
-- Right. Most of the time.
-- Well, you can, you can sort of force it to a region,

310
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:56,950
a

311
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:00,659
region, Canada one or us East two. Which,

312
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:01,780
but we

313
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:07,250
-- think is like Ohio,
-- nobody knows where that is. And how many buildings do they have?

314
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,210
I don't know.

315
00:13:08,219 --> 00:13:10,130
Well, it's not so much how many buildings they,

316
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,669
but the thing to remember is like an Amazon

317
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:14,750
availability zone is like multiple is my understanding.

318
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,669
I could be wrong but it's multiple discrete,

319
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:19,450
what we would traditionally call a data center campus.

320
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,489
It's like multiples of those because, you know, a tornado hits one and, well,

321
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,099
whoops, we lost one but we got two more.

322
00:13:25,109 --> 00:13:25,669
-- We're
-- ok.

323
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:26,700
Stop

324
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:30,950
guessing what Amazon's doing. Let's reel it back to the context of more to the point.

325
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,969
We don't have to guess because they filled out a bunch of sock

326
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,659
two reports and all this other stuff saying that they like engineered,

327
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:39,789
they over engineered the bejesus out of this and I'm inclined to trust them,

328
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:40,900
you know, it's like cars, right?

329
00:13:40,909 --> 00:13:42,979
What steel alloy does your car frame use?

330
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,900
Was it chewing gum or whatever steel, that's good.

331
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,080
I assume it's the good one,

332
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:50,419
the National Insurance Institute or whatever it's called,

333
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:54,869
tested it. And since they're selling me insurance on my car,

334
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,719
I assume it passed.

335
00:13:56,729 --> 00:13:57,830
Well, funny story,

336
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,070
remember there was that Japanese scandal a few years ago

337
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,229
where this major steel company was faking steel testing results.

338
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:08,650
And so there's all this steel floating around that may or may not be what it says it is,

339
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:09,650
But in general, you know.

340
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:10,349
Yeah. No, you're right.

341
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:13,190
There's testing and there's regulation for this that works.

342
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,010
There's always going to be

343
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,840
off events, but you can't plan for them. So don't try.

344
00:14:18,849 --> 00:14:22,400
And there's nothing more infuriating to me than people who

345
00:14:22,409 --> 00:14:25,559
try to include Black Swan events and their threat models.

346
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:29,210
Like if it is a Black Swan event, it doesn't belong in a threat model.

347
00:14:29,219 --> 00:14:32,080
And actually this is, it's funny, I mentioned this.

348
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:35,840
So there's my mythic Star Trek talk, I've been working on right forever,

349
00:14:35,849 --> 00:14:38,080
which has been canceled from all the events it was going to be at.

350
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,169
But whatever it doesn't matter.

351
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:40,840
I just,

352
00:14:40,849 --> 00:14:42,880
I've been working on the slides and I just added

353
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,359
a slide for the episode where I call it,

354
00:14:45,369 --> 00:14:47,609
Picard has a fiddle duel with the devil.

355
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:50,299
And there's, there's an episode which one was that

356
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,359
it's called, I forget the name of it.

357
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:56,320
There's a character named Ara who is supposedly like the devil

358
00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:00,219
who's collecting on a bargain a society made 1000 years ago

359
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:04,510
and she turns out to be a scam artist, but like, I'm using this as an example of like,

360
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,179
does your threat model include the devil?

361
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:11,075
Well, I hope not, you know, like, because how do you possibly plan for that?

362
00:15:11,085 --> 00:15:12,955
And what does it mean? You know? You know what I'm saying?

363
00:15:12,966 --> 00:15:16,825
-- Well,
-- and again, you know, we go back to taking reasonable precautions. Yeah, so

364
00:15:16,926 --> 00:15:18,156
back to the treadmill thing.

365
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:22,716
So it's, you know, it's funny to me because, yeah, a lot of this is obvious legalese,

366
00:15:22,726 --> 00:15:24,955
like keeping your pets and under 13

367
00:15:25,205 --> 00:15:27,176
year old Children away from it.

368
00:15:27,185 --> 00:15:32,515
Although somehow magically the day they turn 13 it'll be ok and safe for them to use.

369
00:15:32,526 --> 00:15:36,505
-- I,
-- for whatever reason, 13 is a magic age in the legal world.

370
00:15:36,515 --> 00:15:38,435
It seems because it's the same deal with online.

371
00:15:38,762 --> 00:15:41,841
Your kids aren't allowed to have any online, anything till they turn 13.

372
00:15:41,851 --> 00:15:44,271
And then all of a sudden, like, open the floodgates. Everyone.

373
00:15:44,281 --> 00:15:46,841
-- Uh,
-- my kids have lots of online stuff.

374
00:15:46,851 --> 00:15:48,932
Well, they're not supposed to Xbox.

375
00:15:49,012 --> 00:15:51,882
That's different. Actually, Microsoft has a nice program for that.

376
00:15:51,892 --> 00:15:53,711
There's a lot of these services though that if,

377
00:15:53,721 --> 00:15:57,171
if they ask for a birthday and you're under 13, they're just like, no, can't do it.

378
00:15:57,182 --> 00:16:00,651
But then what I love is you can hit back, change a birthday and they're like, oh,

379
00:16:00,661 --> 00:16:01,702
good job, everyone.

380
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,262
Congratulations. You're 13 now.

381
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:07,632
And it's like everyone knows what's going on here but everyone,

382
00:16:07,768 --> 00:16:08,357
it's not.

383
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,388
And actually, I mean,

384
00:16:09,398 --> 00:16:11,507
this is one of the problems I think is these

385
00:16:11,518 --> 00:16:14,848
younger kids will try to sign up for a service.

386
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:18,357
They're told you have to be 13. So they enter a wrong birth date in many instances.

387
00:16:18,367 --> 00:16:21,047
They're just entering like I'm 45 now, you know, I'm not, you know,

388
00:16:21,057 --> 00:16:23,028
whatever that is more dangerous like that.

389
00:16:23,038 --> 00:16:24,028
That's a great example.

390
00:16:24,038 --> 00:16:26,987
And like we do this in security or we say, oh no, you can't do that.

391
00:16:26,997 --> 00:16:31,987
And so people just find a way to go around us and now we've fallen out of their ability

392
00:16:31,997 --> 00:16:34,828
to actually help and monitor and they've gone off

393
00:16:34,838 --> 00:16:37,984
grid and that's far more dangerous in every instance.

394
00:16:37,994 --> 00:16:42,674
Well, yeah, I mean, I can't even imagine how many people have removed, you know,

395
00:16:42,684 --> 00:16:45,614
safety, software, security, software, disabled bits of it.

396
00:16:45,624 --> 00:16:47,443
-- Yeah. To just get their job done.
-- Right.

397
00:16:47,453 --> 00:16:51,133
I mean, my, again, I, I pick on Se Linux every time if Se Linux

398
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:53,314
gets in my way, I turn it off and I hope

399
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:56,223
hopefully remember to turn it back on later. But I don't know.

400
00:16:56,414 --> 00:16:57,004
I don't know.

401
00:16:57,013 --> 00:16:59,854
I, to me it's funny, the whole idea of multi, true,

402
00:16:59,864 --> 00:17:03,073
multi user systems to me is you're doing it wrong.

403
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:06,134
You should containerize or lambda or as a service

404
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:07,618
now now.

405
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,030
And, well,

406
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,060
-- but we have that now
-- 15 years ago that didn't exist but

407
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,420
it's not 15 years ago anymore.

408
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:12,900
Like

409
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:13,920
-- it,
-- it's not

410
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:14,829
tell that

411
00:17:14,979 --> 00:17:17,780
to the people I've been talking to for the last two weeks.

412
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:20,489
It's like everybody is like, how do you back up your user devices?

413
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,079
And I'm like, I, I don't

414
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,040
like

415
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:27,140
-- every, all our data is in the cloud or
-- it should be seriously,

416
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:27,358
well,

417
00:17:27,368 --> 00:17:28,520
more of the point like, for example,

418
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:33,199
on a phone or tablet to get your data onto the local device and locally manipulate it.

419
00:17:33,209 --> 00:17:34,979
I mean, it's nontrivial like I could do it.

420
00:17:34,989 --> 00:17:37,696
But I mean, if you get me a Google worksheet,

421
00:17:37,706 --> 00:17:41,135
I'd have to do all sorts of shenanigans to actually get it onto my phone and

422
00:17:41,306 --> 00:17:44,296
-- only have it on my phone and manipulate it on my phone and
-- that would be

423
00:17:44,306 --> 00:17:44,855
stupid.

424
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:48,235
Exactly. So the answer is no, no normal user is ever going to do that.

425
00:17:48,865 --> 00:17:52,936
I always love that when someone will send me like AAA Excel spreadsheet.

426
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:56,196
And I'll just say I'm, I'm not going to look at this. You have to send me a Google sheet.

427
00:17:56,206 --> 00:17:57,316
They're like, what?

428
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:01,936
Like, seriously, I'm not going to look at this, like the odds of me messing with this,

429
00:18:01,946 --> 00:18:04,625
sending it back to you and you incorporating the correct changes.

430
00:18:04,712 --> 00:18:05,472
0%.

431
00:18:05,582 --> 00:18:09,602
If you want me to collaborate, you're going to send me a Google Sheet or Microsoft,

432
00:18:09,612 --> 00:18:11,202
you know, office online or whatever.

433
00:18:11,212 --> 00:18:12,692
I don't care, but not this.

434
00:18:12,702 --> 00:18:13,021
And you know,

435
00:18:13,031 --> 00:18:16,212
it's a game changer there telling people there is a work offline button now,

436
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:16,871
right?

437
00:18:16,881 --> 00:18:17,251
Like, and,

438
00:18:17,261 --> 00:18:18,982
and I get it because a lot of people want their

439
00:18:18,991 --> 00:18:21,112
Excel or whatever things so they can work on it.

440
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:21,722
Well,

441
00:18:21,891 --> 00:18:23,692
in past when they were on a plane or whatever,

442
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:26,232
whatever man everywhere has internet now.

443
00:18:26,241 --> 00:18:28,952
Well now, but again, like five years ago,

444
00:18:29,222 --> 00:18:31,371
-- maybe five years ago, but like
-- for real, but more to the point,

445
00:18:31,381 --> 00:18:33,871
there's an offline button now and you can just fuck all your data off.

446
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:37,988
And what I discovered shockingly the the Google change merging.

447
00:18:37,998 --> 00:18:39,647
It's kind of like Google hire smart engineers or

448
00:18:39,657 --> 00:18:43,368
something because the change merging actually shockingly good.

449
00:18:43,378 --> 00:18:45,968
Like because I, I did some major offline edits on a document,

450
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:49,057
forgot to like I had my laptop closed, brought home,

451
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:51,687
started working on it on my desktop and I'm like, where's all my changes?

452
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:54,968
Like my brain didn't even remember that I'd done this offline.

453
00:18:55,488 --> 00:18:56,777
And then I was like, oh no.

454
00:18:56,787 --> 00:19:00,588
And then so I, I literally opened my laptop log in wait like 20 seconds.

455
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:03,017
And then I'm like, oh everything's fine now, just magically synced.

456
00:19:03,339 --> 00:19:06,479
So and I think that's part of it. Like I try to

457
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:10,339
stay abreast of what cloud services have and offer

458
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,209
and kind of what the cool new stuff is

459
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:15,890
-- and even I forget like that this offline thing is an option.
-- Yeah. Yeah, I

460
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:16,270
hear you.

461
00:19:16,449 --> 00:19:18,989
And so again, for normal people to even know that that's a thing.

462
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:22,060
-- Yeah,
-- it's definitely a challenge and even for security things, I mean, this is,

463
00:19:22,069 --> 00:19:25,160
this is one thing actually I try to be sensitive about is

464
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:27,859
there's so much change happening all the time.

465
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:31,160
And, like, even I'll admit, I don't know everything. I learn new things every day.

466
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,109
Unquestionably. But it's, it is hard right now.

467
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:37,020
If you're a security team trying to keep up with the various, you know,

468
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:41,140
threats and risks and everything going on around you, it's, it's a crazy time.

469
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,859
-- Well,
-- plus then you have all the legacy systems where it's like, yeah,

470
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:44,920
the world has been right.

471
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,699
Well, except for this one part that's 20 years

472
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:50,260
-- and mission critical because it does payroll
-- you, you, we need it.

473
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,719
You can't turn it off. No, I love that.

474
00:19:52,729 --> 00:19:53,689
Like I was so proud,

475
00:19:53,699 --> 00:19:57,849
one older system got turned off and it's stayed off and the plan to replace it

476
00:19:57,859 --> 00:20:02,530
-- got mixed and I was just so happy and
-- sometimes that's the right way to do it

477
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:07,339
is if something will accidentally go away, you can work around it somehow.

478
00:20:07,469 --> 00:20:08,140
And then

479
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,729
amazingly,

480
00:20:09,739 --> 00:20:13,900
the system that couldn't be turned off was turned off and the world didn't end.

481
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:16,410
Yeah. The classic scream test methodology.

482
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:18,209
Yes.

483
00:20:18,339 --> 00:20:22,290
I, I always love that in the security universe where it's like, oh, you can't do that,

484
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,949
the world will end and then people do it.

485
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:26,050
And it's like, well, everything's cool guys.

486
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,069
And now what?

487
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:30,209
Well, and, but the challenge is you might also on the flip side,

488
00:20:30,219 --> 00:20:33,170
you might be doing something that ends up creating systemic risk and

489
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:33,810
the world

490
00:20:34,229 --> 00:20:34,560
does

491
00:20:34,689 --> 00:20:38,170
-- sort of end.
-- That is true. There, there can be challenges there.

492
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:38,569
-- We
-- don't

493
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:41,630
-- always know which is
-- which. Well, I mean, that's our job

494
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,349
and

495
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,489
it's one of those things like, yeah, in hindsight.

496
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,319
-- Oh, that should have been an obvious problem.
-- It isn't always.

497
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:52,969
But, I mean, in all seriousness, like this is one of the challenges I think is when,

498
00:20:53,069 --> 00:20:55,640
when the security team is just obsessed with no,

499
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:59,819
then you end up in a situation where you become an obstacle to progress

500
00:20:59,829 --> 00:21:03,380
and you're worked around as a different problem to the one you're ignoring.

501
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,400
-- The problem
-- is incentives, right?

502
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:07,109
Because every time the security team says yes and then something goes wrong,

503
00:21:07,156 --> 00:21:09,406
-- the security team gets beaten with a stick
-- actually.

504
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:13,656
Do you know what? Now that you say that I, I'm sure there's counterexamples to this.

505
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,087
But generally speaking,

506
00:21:15,177 --> 00:21:19,577
when I've seen a security team try to be reasonable and something does go wrong.

507
00:21:19,776 --> 00:21:20,977
I've never seen them like,

508
00:21:20,987 --> 00:21:25,467
harshly punished as long as they deal with the failure appropriately.

509
00:21:25,477 --> 00:21:26,487
Right. Well, and that's the problem.

510
00:21:26,496 --> 00:21:30,016
A lot of organizations are more about blame than about fixing the actual problem.

511
00:21:30,026 --> 00:21:30,457
So it's just

512
00:21:30,604 --> 00:21:31,933
from my local incentive,

513
00:21:31,943 --> 00:21:35,244
my local maximum is to say no and not spend a lot of time and effort

514
00:21:35,254 --> 00:21:38,343
trying to make it better because that's something I really try hard to do is when,

515
00:21:38,354 --> 00:21:40,244
you know, people come to me with a security thing.

516
00:21:40,254 --> 00:21:41,303
I'm like, ok, well,

517
00:21:41,313 --> 00:21:43,933
I actually want to understand what it is you're trying to do

518
00:21:43,943 --> 00:21:45,673
and then let's figure out a good way to do it.

519
00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:48,874
Right. A lot of them, you know, initially are kind of shocked.

520
00:21:48,884 --> 00:21:51,453
They're like, I'm like, I want to help you and they're like, what, you know, that,

521
00:21:51,463 --> 00:21:53,663
that's sort of suspicious where you're offering, you know,

522
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,811
a, a stray dog, some food and the stray dogs, like, I want to bite you,

523
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,291
but it smells like food,

524
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,531
but I don't trust you and I want to bite you.

525
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:04,630
And so many people have just, how many times did somebody in it,

526
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,890
let alone security actually try and help them.

527
00:22:06,901 --> 00:22:08,880
I've had a lot of bad experiences.

528
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:11,791
I mean, I'm not gonna lie and, and I was a lot of bad experiences.

529
00:22:11,801 --> 00:22:14,531
I'm not going to pretend I'm innocent in any of this.

530
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,201
Like my current Sega trying to get this Xbox up and running.

531
00:22:17,729 --> 00:22:19,079
It's so awesome.

532
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:23,680
-- Like I just want to spend some money so we can play games
-- and you know what makes

533
00:22:23,689 --> 00:22:28,040
me sad is Microsoft does a better job at this than almost anyone else I've ever seen.

534
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:28,599
And

535
00:22:28,709 --> 00:22:29,790
-- it is terrible.
-- I

536
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,280
agree.

537
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:33,670
I can't even imagine the nightmare that is other things like Steam is amazing.

538
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,280
I love Steam and now that I'm dealing with Xbox, it's just like, wow, this is

539
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,540
like Microsoft, I just, I know my son is a child

540
00:22:40,719 --> 00:22:43,880
but I want the account to be under his name. That's it. That's what I want.

541
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:46,619
Try signing up for any of these other services with a child.

542
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,550
And you'll see, like,

543
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,819
obviously if your kids are running steam you've lied about their age.

544
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:52,000
-- Oh, really?
-- Ok.

545
00:22:53,569 --> 00:22:55,709
Yeah. Exactly. Exactly.

546
00:22:55,719 --> 00:22:59,319
Because in fact, my kids used my Steam account for a really long time.

547
00:22:59,329 --> 00:23:02,189
And so it's always funny now because I'll look at my,

548
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,229
what it was the list of games played

549
00:23:04,439 --> 00:23:06,430
and it's like, I don't even know what these are

550
00:23:07,229 --> 00:23:10,609
-- but whatever, whatever.
-- I think there's a lot for us still to make

551
00:23:10,905 --> 00:23:11,594
dress on.

552
00:23:11,604 --> 00:23:15,344
And the good news is though I, one thing that frustrates me is like,

553
00:23:15,354 --> 00:23:18,925
there's a lot of other industries that have gotten objectively better.

554
00:23:18,935 --> 00:23:19,974
Like IKEA furniture,

555
00:23:19,984 --> 00:23:23,765
I remember what assembling IKEA furniture was like 2025 years ago compared to now.

556
00:23:23,775 --> 00:23:28,354
And like this treadmill, this treadmill was easy, literally like an hour of my time

557
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:31,125
just putting it together, you know,

558
00:23:31,135 --> 00:23:35,444
cutting the pieces off of the laminated cardboard one step at a time and

559
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:39,560
there were no pieces missing. The counts were correct. Like, yeah, it was lovely.

560
00:23:39,569 --> 00:23:40,239
-- Well,
-- and you know,

561
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:46,430
so part of this too is my suspicion is whoever helped design this assembly program.

562
00:23:46,439 --> 00:23:47,560
I don't know what to even call it.

563
00:23:47,569 --> 00:23:52,449
You need the right incentives because obviously the incentive is you want people to

564
00:23:52,459 --> 00:23:56,180
get your product and not need to call you for help to assemble it.

565
00:23:56,189 --> 00:23:57,400
Well, here's one thing that's interesting.

566
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:00,359
So the manual is model number blah blah blah 0.0.

567
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,069
And then there's this giant piece of

568
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:03,739
yellow paper and they're saying important customer notice

569
00:24:03,935 --> 00:24:07,265
the model number of your treadmill is blah, blah, blah, blah blah 0.3.

570
00:24:07,314 --> 00:24:09,035
So they're iterating

571
00:24:09,165 --> 00:24:11,734
the heck out of this thing like this is the fourth iteration,

572
00:24:11,744 --> 00:24:14,074
I assume they had a 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 I

573
00:24:14,564 --> 00:24:14,795
think.

574
00:24:14,905 --> 00:24:17,045
And so things have clearly changed.

575
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,604
There's one step where it's like, you know,

576
00:24:18,614 --> 00:24:21,005
if this piece has two screws already mounted in it,

577
00:24:21,015 --> 00:24:23,165
take them out and I'm like looking at it and

578
00:24:23,175 --> 00:24:25,275
there's like two screws in this thing and I'm like,

579
00:24:25,285 --> 00:24:26,635
oh, ok, take them out.

580
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:27,474
And so, you know,

581
00:24:27,484 --> 00:24:30,625
it's clear that they've iterated and they've done the value engineering

582
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,619
of kind of either making the parts cheaper or somehow reducing

583
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,739
the parts count or I don't know what the heck doing

584
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,449
because this manual works for this newer version of the treadmill.

585
00:24:38,459 --> 00:24:41,420
And what's interesting though is that they had these steps where it's like,

586
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:41,609
you know,

587
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:45,069
if you see this just kind of ignore it or take it out or throw it away or whatever.

588
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,829
Yeah, they kind of knew that was coming.

589
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:50,229
Maybe there could be a lot of reasons that happened.

590
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:50,469
I mean,

591
00:24:50,479 --> 00:24:53,280
they might have reprinted portions of the manual too because

592
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,489
you think if you only have to reprint page three,

593
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:59,479
it's going to be a lot easier to just reprint page three than like all of it.

594
00:24:59,805 --> 00:25:01,665
So it's, it's what's fascinating to me though is that like,

595
00:25:01,675 --> 00:25:03,505
I look at the security industry and it's the

596
00:25:03,515 --> 00:25:06,545
cloud definitely has been making things a lot better,

597
00:25:06,555 --> 00:25:06,944
right?

598
00:25:06,954 --> 00:25:09,244
Like the number of cloud services now where I can just

599
00:25:09,255 --> 00:25:13,025
do enabling single sign on now for a lot of cloud services

600
00:25:13,525 --> 00:25:18,614
is like in Zendesk, it was like go to this one page and and turn it on and yeah, that's,

601
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:19,545
that's awesome, right?

602
00:25:19,555 --> 00:25:20,354
It's like with Slack,

603
00:25:20,364 --> 00:25:24,295
I think I had to click a link in an email to prove that I own that domain kind of thing,

604
00:25:24,305 --> 00:25:24,474
right?

605
00:25:24,484 --> 00:25:26,185
Like literally, it was so

606
00:25:26,385 --> 00:25:27,665
so easy

607
00:25:27,979 --> 00:25:31,439
and I think about what it was like, you know, 5, 10 years ago, oh God,

608
00:25:31,449 --> 00:25:33,459
I don't even want to think about what it was like five or 10 years ago.

609
00:25:33,469 --> 00:25:34,599
No, it was, it was terrible.

610
00:25:34,609 --> 00:25:37,160
But then you look at the the software world and most of these

611
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:40,199
things trying to enable single sign on in a piece of software.

612
00:25:40,209 --> 00:25:41,319
No, I hear you.

613
00:25:41,329 --> 00:25:47,239
And I guess that's like, look, that's the overall message here is it's all about

614
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,109
if I was a user,

615
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:53,750
what does that mean? Right. What is my experience look like? How can I make it better?

616
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,390
And this is true of if you're building security

617
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,790
features or even if you're building security process,

618
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,689
put yourself in the other position

619
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:04,739
and say, what does this look like? And then how can I make it?

620
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:09,790
-- So obviously, the, the less callbacks the customer,
-- well, even simpler,

621
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,770
if users can't use your stuff, they're not going to use your stuff or,

622
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,339
or they waste your time asking for clarification,

623
00:26:16,836 --> 00:26:18,345
which is not good either.

624
00:26:18,436 --> 00:26:22,666
And obviously in many business settings, you can't not use something

625
00:26:22,776 --> 00:26:25,505
because you're an employee at the company and you

626
00:26:25,515 --> 00:26:28,416
need your laptop tied into email or whatever.

627
00:26:28,475 --> 00:26:31,145
All right. So we've been, we've been going on and on about this.

628
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:34,546
But you, you told me at the beginning you have a funny story to tell.

629
00:26:34,556 --> 00:26:35,755
And before you run out of time,

630
00:26:35,765 --> 00:26:38,406
I want to hear it because I'm concerned you won't tell

631
00:26:38,416 --> 00:26:41,056
-- me otherwise
-- I go shopping like once a week now,

632
00:26:41,076 --> 00:26:42,826
you know, I'm wearing my P PE and everything

633
00:26:43,452 --> 00:26:45,842
and I was at a red light

634
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:49,501
on a major road and there's this silver car kind of

635
00:26:49,511 --> 00:26:52,182
coming southbound on this major road kind of lurching along.

636
00:26:52,192 --> 00:26:54,722
And I'm like, wow, that person is drunk, like

637
00:26:54,952 --> 00:26:58,381
they can't drive in a straight line for more than 4 ft without suddenly stopping.

638
00:26:58,391 --> 00:26:58,822
And then,

639
00:26:58,932 --> 00:27:00,082
you know, I'm just like, wow,

640
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:03,802
and then I take a closer look and like the, the, the pass or the driver's side,

641
00:27:03,812 --> 00:27:07,631
front end is smashed in at the corner and I'm like, ok, like their cars all beat up

642
00:27:08,052 --> 00:27:11,537
and then I noticed the tires, the one tire pointed in at 15 degrees.

643
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:12,697
Oh, that seems normal.

644
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:14,277
Yeah, this is a major road.

645
00:27:14,287 --> 00:27:17,137
Like this person has been driving on this road for a while anyways, they,

646
00:27:17,147 --> 00:27:19,578
they get through the green light, their green light and I, like,

647
00:27:19,588 --> 00:27:20,958
pull behind them and I'm like,

648
00:27:21,197 --> 00:27:25,078
honking at them and, like, kind of waving my arm to get them to stop because like

649
00:27:25,407 --> 00:27:27,998
this person literally she can't drive her car like more

650
00:27:28,008 --> 00:27:30,687
than about eight or 9 ft without it lurching because

651
00:27:30,897 --> 00:27:32,037
the axle is broken.

652
00:27:32,537 --> 00:27:35,708
So I pull over in front of her to like force her to physically stop.

653
00:27:35,718 --> 00:27:37,154
And I call the police and the police are like, oh, ok.

654
00:27:37,163 --> 00:27:37,874
Yeah, we'll send, you know,

655
00:27:37,884 --> 00:27:41,394
we put a call out and actually a cop showed up like less than five minutes later

656
00:27:42,124 --> 00:27:43,553
and you know, I see in the rear view mirror,

657
00:27:43,563 --> 00:27:45,343
I see him talk to her and then he comes up to me,

658
00:27:45,354 --> 00:27:46,614
he starts talking to me and then he looks back at me.

659
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:50,114
He's like, 00 wow. Yeah, that looks way worse from the front than from the side.

660
00:27:50,124 --> 00:27:50,754
And he's like, yeah,

661
00:27:50,764 --> 00:27:52,193
so because one of the questions they asked me is

662
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:54,114
like there is there a damage sticker on the car?

663
00:27:54,124 --> 00:27:55,984
You know, like when you get in an accident, your car is beat up,

664
00:27:55,994 --> 00:27:58,703
you have that sticker on it saying like my car got this damage.

665
00:27:58,713 --> 00:28:01,124
So, like, don't worry about it. I reported to the police. We cool.

666
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:03,874
So, you know that it's like they didn't commit a hit and run or whatever.

667
00:28:04,209 --> 00:28:05,560
All right. Cool. Right.

668
00:28:05,719 --> 00:28:07,640
So, anyways there's no damage to her.

669
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:10,810
So I'm like, yeah, this must be like new and I, whatever she hit, like,

670
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:12,540
she hit it pretty hard because,

671
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,750
I mean, to break an axle on a car, you know, those things are made out of metal

672
00:28:15,989 --> 00:28:17,859
anyways, the accident had happened,

673
00:28:17,869 --> 00:28:21,359
she said a half an hour ago and she'd been driving like this for half an hour.

674
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,729
And he's like, yeah, she, she's agreed like she was now saying that, oh,

675
00:28:25,739 --> 00:28:29,119
I'm just trying to pull over on this one road over here to wait for a tow truck.

676
00:28:29,266 --> 00:28:29,597
Right.

677
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:33,597
So, yeah, I assume, you know, rather than get a ticket, she's like, oh, I meant to,

678
00:28:33,607 --> 00:28:35,016
you know, I was trying to pull over

679
00:28:36,187 --> 00:28:38,737
and it just blew my mind that this person had been

680
00:28:38,906 --> 00:28:43,536
driving their car around for like half an hour with a broken axle,

681
00:28:43,546 --> 00:28:47,097
eight or 9 ft at a time lurching into the other lane.

682
00:28:47,146 --> 00:28:49,577
I imagine if you're driving around with a broken axle,

683
00:28:49,587 --> 00:28:53,536
like you've gone from probably bad damage to catastrophic damage.

684
00:28:54,213 --> 00:28:55,524
Yeah, I know the car is probably a write off

685
00:28:55,864 --> 00:28:58,223
at the front end is going to have to be replaced which, you know,

686
00:28:59,244 --> 00:29:01,354
it's a Subaru. So it's

687
00:29:01,484 --> 00:29:02,734
not going to be cheap

688
00:29:03,144 --> 00:29:07,124
and it just, it blew my mind that I get, that you're in an accident, you get shook up.

689
00:29:07,134 --> 00:29:08,953
But if your car can't drive more than eight

690
00:29:08,963 --> 00:29:11,784
or 9 ft without lurching to one side violently,

691
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:14,053
like you got to stop and call a tow truck people and,

692
00:29:14,063 --> 00:29:17,014
and I see this in security people do some sort of, oh, no, no, no.

693
00:29:17,024 --> 00:29:19,154
It's normal. Like we just turn the system off and on every seven

694
00:29:19,421 --> 00:29:19,860
minutes.

695
00:29:20,031 --> 00:29:22,811
Yeah. Yeah, that's, that's a good story.

696
00:29:22,831 --> 00:29:27,230
-- Like I,
-- I just, I don't know what to make of, you know, like this person, I just, what,

697
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,331
I just don't, yeah,

698
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:33,301
I just can't fathom this kind of this thought process where something is that

699
00:29:33,421 --> 00:29:37,890
-- terribly broken and they're just trying to live with it.
-- I can explain this.

700
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,120
This is a very human condition

701
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:44,130
and I will throw security people under the bus. Here is,

702
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,430
there was a period of time

703
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,430
where

704
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,189
we had, I, I worked at a company, everyone had their own computers.

705
00:29:52,199 --> 00:29:53,900
They were expected to take care of them

706
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,719
and then at some point,

707
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,750
yeah, whatever.

708
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,270
At some point the,

709
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,270
basically an inventory was taken of operating

710
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,484
systems and computers and everything going on.

711
00:30:03,494 --> 00:30:06,594
It was part of some compliance program that was needed for.

712
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:08,104
I don't even remember what anymore.

713
00:30:08,114 --> 00:30:11,814
It's been so long the security people by far had

714
00:30:11,824 --> 00:30:15,265
applied fewer updates than anyone else in the company.

715
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:18,525
But this is, it's very typical. Right. I'm a security person.

716
00:30:18,535 --> 00:30:21,145
I don't need to worry about that. I know what, what I'm doing.

717
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:24,000
And I think this is very typical of people where people love to be.

718
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:24,869
Like, well, I'm special.

719
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,900
I don't need to worry about that because I'm, I'm not like everyone else. And it's,

720
00:30:29,199 --> 00:30:31,109
yeah, you are like,

721
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:35,030
the rules need to apply to, you just like they apply to me because if they don't,

722
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,709
then society collapses

723
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:39,949
talking about society collapsing is probably less funny right now.

724
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:41,680
-- But you know what I mean? Like it
-- is a great,

725
00:30:42,213 --> 00:30:45,863
-- we've gone through worse
-- maybe. But I think it's human nature.

726
00:30:45,873 --> 00:30:48,383
And I think the, the key to this though

727
00:30:48,493 --> 00:30:51,873
is not shame and yelling,

728
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:54,062
which is what like security is historically

729
00:30:54,072 --> 00:30:57,233
trying to do it is compassion and understanding

730
00:30:57,373 --> 00:31:00,512
of saying, ok, so you did this thing.

731
00:31:00,743 --> 00:31:02,912
Here's how we can help you fix it.

732
00:31:03,015 --> 00:31:05,056
Like you have to go do this now. You stupid idiot.

733
00:31:05,066 --> 00:31:06,745
Well, yeah, that's I was, I was telling her I'm like, lady,

734
00:31:06,755 --> 00:31:07,686
you need to call a tow truck.

735
00:31:07,696 --> 00:31:10,686
Like you can't, you can't drive on that like it's broken,

736
00:31:10,696 --> 00:31:12,115
like not a little bit broken.

737
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:14,426
It's like broken, broken, like your car's doing ballet

738
00:31:14,546 --> 00:31:19,635
-- and
-- sometimes all people need is another person to give them a little nudge and,

739
00:31:19,645 --> 00:31:20,875
and then they do the right thing.

740
00:31:20,885 --> 00:31:21,105
Yeah.

741
00:31:21,115 --> 00:31:23,656
In this case, that's the reason I had to block her is because she kept trying to go.

742
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:30,439
Now, I will say my personal stance on a lot of this is often

743
00:31:30,849 --> 00:31:32,680
when I see a situation like that,

744
00:31:32,689 --> 00:31:37,479
I'm not overly inclined to get involved generally because it can, it can go bad

745
00:31:37,719 --> 00:31:39,069
in terrible ways.

746
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:43,359
-- Like, you're lucky. I
-- live in Canada. That's much less of a concern.

747
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:45,760
-- Yeah,
-- there's, there's less guns and stuff but, like,

748
00:31:45,849 --> 00:31:48,479
even ignoring that kind of stuff, I have seen people, like,

749
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:51,400
get the crap beat out of them doing stuff like what you just did.

750
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,359
I stayed in my car, the doors were locked, like, yeah, no, I get it.

751
00:31:54,369 --> 00:31:58,665
But at the same time, I also felt like this is going to crash into somebody and, well,

752
00:31:58,675 --> 00:31:59,435
I could have stopped it.

753
00:31:59,444 --> 00:32:03,854
Well, I, I commend you and I think we need more people who will do those little things.

754
00:32:03,864 --> 00:32:06,714
Like another great example I saw when I was at the Home Depot

755
00:32:06,974 --> 00:32:08,155
coming out, loading my car,

756
00:32:08,165 --> 00:32:10,464
these two guys are loading their truck and then they peel

757
00:32:10,474 --> 00:32:12,435
off their nitro gloves and throw them on the ground.

758
00:32:12,444 --> 00:32:14,555
Now that's just littering. Don't do that.

759
00:32:14,655 --> 00:32:16,675
And I, I yell at them and I'm like, hey, you know,

760
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:19,155
pick that up and put in the garbage and he looked at me and I'm like,

761
00:32:19,449 --> 00:32:20,349
put it in the garbage

762
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,750
and they did pick it up and throw it in the back of their truck.

763
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,569
So it might have ended up in the garbage. But

764
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:28,579
I, I mean, I think we need more people who will speak up and say, you know, look,

765
00:32:28,589 --> 00:32:31,890
stop spitting on the ground or stop whatever it is you're doing, that's ridiculous.

766
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:36,510
And just not hard to change the behavior and make the world a much better place.

767
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:40,869
Maybe I'm going to end this episode before we get into that discussion because I,

768
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,020
I feel unprepared

769
00:32:43,219 --> 00:32:45,354
to discuss that and I have a feeling you

770
00:32:45,364 --> 00:32:49,094
and I have fundamental differences in our opinions here.

771
00:32:49,114 --> 00:32:53,255
So that's ok though. Right? I'm calling it. That is a marvelous story though.
