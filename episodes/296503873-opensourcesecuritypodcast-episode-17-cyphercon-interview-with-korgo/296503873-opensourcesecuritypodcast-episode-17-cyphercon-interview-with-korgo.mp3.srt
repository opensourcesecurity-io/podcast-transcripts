Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast on December the fifth.

1
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:10,229
This is myself,

2
00:00:10,239 --> 00:00:15,289
Kurt Siefried with my co-host Josh Bresser and a special guest today, Michael

3
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:15,810
Gosman,

4
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:17,500
Michael. Say hello.

5
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:20,209
-- Hey, everybody. How's it going
-- going?

6
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:21,360
Good. So, uh

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,879
so I run a, a hacker conference in Wisconsin called Cipher Con

8
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:27,639
and uh

9
00:00:27,909 --> 00:00:31,829
uh we're new as of 2016 and just wanted to, uh

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:32,720
you know,

11
00:00:32,919 --> 00:00:36,439
let everybody become aware of our existence.

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,060
Um Wisconsin can be a quiet place and just trying to pull everybody together.

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,229
Indeed. Awesome.

14
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:46,360
And, and in fact, uh Mike, you and I met some time ago at a what, what's it called?

15
00:00:46,369 --> 00:00:49,479
920 Security or something or other? It's a local meet up

16
00:00:49,639 --> 00:00:49,869
and

17
00:00:50,599 --> 00:00:52,970
yeah, so 920 sec.

18
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:58,779
Um so I'm a co founder of 920 sec and that is uh Green Bay Wisconsin Go Packers.

19
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:02,500
It's a really, really small community and we're trying to um

20
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:06,870
have a regional pull together. So, hence the uh area code 920,

21
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,080
-- yeah,
-- totally, totally. So

22
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:13,610
now, now for those folks listening who, who might not know you by the name, Mike,

23
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,699
you also go by

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,419
KGO on Irc

25
00:01:16,839 --> 00:01:20,419
which, which I must ask uh what is the history behind Cargo?

26
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,720
How did you come up with that one?

27
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,440
Yeah, so that's a great question. Um

28
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:31,250
So I was probably in like middle school and uh I was sitting on Irc in, in the channels,

29
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,220
I sit in for like years, right?

30
00:01:33,559 --> 00:01:35,699
And we started catching on to these other names

31
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:41,449
and some dude came into Irc and was obviously using an alias.

32
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:44,129
So like a one time alias didn't know who he was

33
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:48,900
and he's like cargo. I like you so much that I named my virus after you.

34
00:01:49,279 --> 00:01:50,660
And I'm like, what?

35
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:56,330
And uh or, or I was under a different name, but he created this cargo

36
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,209
virus

37
00:01:57,699 --> 00:02:02,160
and he put all my contact information in the code of the virus, right?

38
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,480
And released it out to the uh

39
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,850
the wild West. You know, let's jump around the air tubes of the internet

40
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:13,729
and I'm waiting for a knock on the door from the FBI or something cause like

41
00:02:13,899 --> 00:02:16,449
he put all my contact information in there.

42
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,600
Uh You know, about a year later, I'm like, well, I guess I never got busted for that.

43
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,080
And this guy did a shout out to me on this coral

44
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:24,869
virus.

45
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,639
So uh I, I named my hacker name, my hacker tag to uh

46
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:33,000
to cargo kind of in honor of this anonymous figure

47
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:35,639
that tried to have the FBI knock on my door.

48
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:39,039
That's a great story. Holy cow.

49
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:42,940
I'm, I'm, I'm still half waiting for somebody to knock on my door and be like, dude,

50
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:44,289
like, what was up with that virus?

51
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,289
-- Do
-- you have a copy of it?

52
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,720
You need to get that and, and at least strings the thing right to, to show off.

53
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,889
Yeah. So if you google cargo

54
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:54,889
virus,

55
00:02:55,029 --> 00:02:57,089
there's like tons of information on it.

56
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,059
Oh man, that is so cool.

57
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,500
Nice.

58
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,240
So a

59
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:05,710
warning to those that like hang out on the IRC far too long, you'll get,

60
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,289
get an hour named after you.

61
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:12,139
Only, only the lucky ones, man, only the lucky ones. It's

62
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:14,350
I love it.

63
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,520
Ok, so, so you run Cipher Con,

64
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:21,309
which is the real reason we asked you to talk to us because

65
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:24,589
conferences are crazy to run.

66
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,550
It's one of those things that people love to go

67
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:29,509
and complain about the management or what happened or whatever,

68
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:29,949
but

69
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:31,630
it, it's like insane

70
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:33,449
to run this, this sort of stuff.

71
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:38,550
So, so let me ask you this, what on earth possessed you to start and,

72
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:41,919
and even do it again, but of running a a hacker con.

73
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:45,529
So the reason why I started cipher Con was

74
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:48,789
there was a hacker space in Milwaukee called Bucket Works

75
00:03:48,899 --> 00:03:51,619
due to financial reasons. It kind of went under

76
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,630
and what that did was

77
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,199
it scattered the attendees or, or you know,

78
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:02,779
the guys they used to hang out with uh all over the place into multiple groups, right?

79
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:04,800
You got your software people, your,

80
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,729
um, you know, your, your pen testers, your,

81
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,669
your hardware people and they all kind of went

82
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:13,080
into different little groups and different little pockets.

83
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:19,190
And I found myself going to like eight or 10 of these a month and it was just killing my,

84
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,428
uh,

85
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,690
productivity because I'm going to all these events

86
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,450
because I wanna see one or two different

87
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:27,920
friends of each of these groups as I went around these groups for about a year.

88
00:04:27,929 --> 00:04:31,910
I'm like, hey, you know, we should, we should all, like, throw together this, like,

89
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,450
alumni group or whatever

90
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:37,170
and bring everybody together and everybody's like, yeah,

91
00:04:37,179 --> 00:04:38,399
that's a really good idea.

92
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,670
But it never went anywhere.

93
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,369
So, finally I'm like, all right,

94
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:44,290
I'll like,

95
00:04:44,549 --> 00:04:46,809
risk putting 80

96
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:52,089
the funding for like, 80 people together and we would do it at the safe house.

97
00:04:52,239 --> 00:04:54,640
So people not familiar with the safe house

98
00:04:54,989 --> 00:05:00,649
is a spy bar slash restaurant slash club,

99
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,609
um, with a Cold War theme and I thought it was very fitting.

100
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:05,929
Um,

101
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,649
not just a Cold War theme. Right? How do you get in?

102
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,690
Because that's, that's really the trick, isn't

103
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:10,869
it?

104
00:05:11,609 --> 00:05:15,529
No, I, I, you can't discuss that. You gotta earn your wage.

105
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,049
Let's just say it, it, it's not obvious to get in. Right.

106
00:05:19,059 --> 00:05:21,869
It, it's a bit of the, the old school, you know, knock the,

107
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,040
knock and say the password sort of stuff.

108
00:05:24,049 --> 00:05:24,320
Right.

109
00:05:24,429 --> 00:05:24,790
Yeah.

110
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,739
If you don't know the secret handshake,

111
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,899
you're not like you're not in until you earn it.

112
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,970
So, yeah, you know it's, it's been around for like 50 years.

113
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,510
Um it's, it's, it's a gem, a hidden gem of Milwaukee, right.

114
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:44,540
So I thought it was perfect. Uh spy theme a lot picking, you know, just screen hacker.

115
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,500
And um

116
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,380
so I, I did the down payment myself and I'm like, all right, you know,

117
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,519
I'm just gonna say everybody chipping 100 bucks

118
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:59,739
and uh almost immediately I sold out of the 80 tickets and I was like, wow, like this,

119
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:00,880
this is gonna,

120
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,600
this is gonna be an awesome party.

121
00:06:03,109 --> 00:06:07,500
I'm gonna have some speakers, you know, we're gonna get some food cheese curd,

122
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,609
you know, the Wisconsin delicacy.

123
00:06:10,059 --> 00:06:10,709
Um

124
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:16,010
And, and then all of a sudden I had people like sending me messages like you asshole

125
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,529
cargo. You didn't tell me anything about this.

126
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:23,239
Like I thought we were friends and I was like, oh crap. So I expanded the space

127
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,750
um up to 100 and 25

128
00:06:25,989 --> 00:06:29,049
and I expanded the space again and again and again.

129
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:31,429
So eventually I expanded it six times

130
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:33,369
and it turned to a two day event

131
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,029
the second day being at the Fister Hotel, which is the Fanciest Hotel in Milwaukee.

132
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,380
So it was kind of eerie

133
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:43,209
like this, like a Renaissance art and Renaissance theme

134
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:45,209
and it's uh

135
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,309
it's really high end place and then everybody in their hacker black hoodies,

136
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:49,950
you know,

137
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,630
really awesome. Um

138
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:58,109
We ended up with 225 attendees for our first year. Um

139
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,279
And

140
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:03,130
I, I'm obviously biased but I thought it was an amazing event

141
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:05,950
that, that's crazy, man for a first year. Con

142
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,230
225 is solid. Well done.

143
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:09,579
Congrats.

144
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:11,209
-- So, so I
-- mean

145
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:15,820
that was planning, that was like 4 to 5 months of planning.

146
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:19,029
So I was like nervous that something would fall apart.

147
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,299
Well, we, we, we'll get to that.

148
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:22,290
But uh

149
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,279
I, I guess let's start here is why don't you give us a recap of the first cipher

150
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:26,859
con

151
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,920
and, and kind of the highlights you thought were, were really stand out.

152
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:33,649
Awesome and, and just the general feel for the conference of what the themes were

153
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,899
and the folks who attended and just kind of all that fun for the people

154
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,980
out there who maybe have never heard of cipher con prior to right now.

155
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,570
Sure. So, uh

156
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,730
we had, um

157
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:49,839
I mean, we had all sorts of amazing speakers, so I'm talking like 20 speakers,

158
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:50,609
I

159
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:55,049
guess. Uh I'll start with a keynote. Um We had Jo Cicero who's from Green Bay

160
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,480
and he talked on pissed

161
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:02,640
and pissed is privacy in a surveillance state of vaping detection.

162
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:04,160
And um

163
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,640
just talks about like,

164
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:10,779
if you wanna hide how difficult it is. I mean, if you're on the internet,

165
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,320
can they reverse back to where you are?

166
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:16,160
And there's just step after step,

167
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:20,890
after step of things you'd have to do to completely be anonymous.

168
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,329
And at the end of it, you, you're just like, yeah, I'm not anonymous.

169
00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:28,130
I'm curious, did he talk about

170
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,570
between masking and hiding at all or any of the masking type stuff?

171
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:38,229
So, there were tidbits on, like, you know, here, here's what you could do.

172
00:08:38,239 --> 00:08:39,169
Here's what,

173
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,039
um,

174
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,500
you know,

175
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:46,299
here's the various options on each of these different steps that you can do.

176
00:08:47,049 --> 00:08:51,719
But a better answer would be on cipher

177
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,349
Con's website. We have the talks recorded.

178
00:08:54,549 --> 00:08:55,750
So, um

179
00:08:56,090 --> 00:09:00,270
you know, when you get into the nitty gritty details, I would just go watch the video

180
00:09:01,669 --> 00:09:02,000
and that,

181
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:05,440
that's a great thing to know too is uh recording talks

182
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,239
if you run a conference and you don't do that.

183
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:12,090
I'm looking at Urs a uh shame on you because there is no excuse anymore to do,

184
00:09:12,099 --> 00:09:12,679
not do that.

185
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,890
And I will put links to the videos and the conference website,

186
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,940
all kinds of fun stuff in the show notes.

187
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:22,099
For those of you who don't know, but for people too lazy to look at my show notes,

188
00:09:22,109 --> 00:09:22,719
the uh what

189
00:09:22,859 --> 00:09:24,020
cipher con.com, right?

190
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:30,260
And uh so I guess like some of the other talks we had like Scott Irving,

191
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:36,559
um he's well known in the uh the hacker realm for protecting medical devices and

192
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:40,780
setting up honey pots to see how many people are really attacking medical devices.

193
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,909
Um We had uh so this one talk that wasn't recorded, that was Raymond Benson.

194
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,460
He is a James Bond novelist.

195
00:09:49,859 --> 00:09:50,239
So I,

196
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,669
I thought it was fitting that if we were at the

197
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:56,280
safe house with a Cold War espionage theme that we have um

198
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,289
one James Bond novelist for the fantasy side of things.

199
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,299
Um And then we also,

200
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:05,580
and we also had Warner um

201
00:10:06,469 --> 00:10:11,590
one or a personal friend of mine uh was an actual US spy

202
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:17,770
during the Cold War caught in Eastern Berlin. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison

203
00:10:17,969 --> 00:10:18,929
and did eight.

204
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:21,729
So he's like a Cold War convict.

205
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,169
So

206
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,919
I had some of the other speakers are like, you know, how can I compete with that?

207
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:31,969
You have a US spy that got caught and they had like imprisoned, like,

208
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,239
how am I supposed to,

209
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,510
how am I supposed to compete with that?

210
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:37,650
Yeah,

211
00:10:37,849 --> 00:10:38,309
that's,

212
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,369
that's wild.

213
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:41,940
It's deep. Yeah. And,

214
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:45,229
you know, he pulled me aside and told me some of the, uh, like

215
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:47,859
some other stories of what was happening

216
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:49,419
and you could tell like

217
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,109
he was still kinda

218
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,890
shaky on who he could tell some of the stories. Um

219
00:10:55,419 --> 00:10:59,099
I'm guessing like, you know, once you, once you're a spy, you're always a spy,

220
00:10:59,669 --> 00:11:03,989
right? Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Seriously. Oh, man, that's so crazy.

221
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,969
So again his talk, his talk is recorded.

222
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:11,419
Um I would go check it out like that's probably, you know, I,

223
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:13,710
since he's a personal friend of mine.

224
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,549
Um, he's local. He's never spoke at a hacker con. So,

225
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,650
I guess for cipher con I've always wanted to

226
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:25,150
dabble a little bit outside of the normal. And, um,

227
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,719
I mean, really, what is the difference between

228
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:32,750
Cold War espionage and cyber war? You know, cyber war is still espionage.

229
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,549
Just a little more modern version.

230
00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:38,359
Yeah. Oh, totally. Totally. Man. That's, uh,

231
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:40,059
that's a good point actually.

232
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,500
And, and I know, I love reading the stories of,

233
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,080
of some of that Cold War crazy that went on.

234
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:45,700
It. It was,

235
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,469
it's, it's surreal. Right. It's more bizarre

236
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:52,549
than most people can imagine, which is all part of the fun and,

237
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:55,159
and part of me is terrified but also excited

238
00:11:55,169 --> 00:11:57,429
to read about the insane things they're doing today

239
00:11:57,599 --> 00:12:00,030
that we won't find about for 50 more years, you know, assuming, like,

240
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:02,650
we don't kill each other, the robots take over before that.

241
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,849
I, I do have to wonder what the modern equivalent of acoustic kitty is,

242
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:11,150
you know, for those of you that don't know, the CIA attempted to

243
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,229
essentially turn a cat into a listening device

244
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:17,630
and the poor thing ran across the street and got, ran over, like, right away.

245
00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:20,020
Um, so, I mean, yeah,

246
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,309
there's all sorts of crazy stuff and I can only imagine today what they're doing,

247
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,030
-- we don't
-- wanna know.

248
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,450
All right. So,

249
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,020
some of the,

250
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:34,739
some of the other speakers we had, uh, JP Smith of Chicago.

251
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:39,770
Um, Chris Roberts, the guy allegedly who, uh, revved up an engine on an airplane.

252
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,590
He came and talked to us about, uh,

253
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:44,080
hacking cows in the food chain.

254
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:47,619
So it's fitting for Wisconsin and all our, uh, our farming,

255
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:48,669
um,

256
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,289
Johnny Christmas hack for pancakes. Um,

257
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,979
I mean, we had all sorts of amazing top notch speakers

258
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,119
and then, like, even beyond speaking,

259
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,340
um, we had all the villages, so we had, uh,

260
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:07,000
our main village and it'll always be our number one village is cipher village.

261
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:09,340
Um, because we're cipher con obviously, right?

262
00:13:09,729 --> 00:13:10,469
And, uh

263
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:14,890
have uh crypto um puzzles and anybody who

264
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,770
beats all the way through the crypto puzzles,

265
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:21,239
just like defcon receives a lifetime badge, except for ours is red.

266
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,859
I like to affect,

267
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:26,750
I personally affectionately call it the blood badge because

268
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,760
you have it for the blood of your life,

269
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:29,159
you know.

270
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:30,520
Right. Right.

271
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:35,119
And, and I imagine, uh it's a lot of math, right? And we all know math is hard.

272
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:37,070
So, I mean,

273
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:39,270
I don't want that to scare anybody.

274
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,840
Um, I mean, we're kind of like a, like an entry level crypto

275
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,690
con disguise is a hacker con,

276
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:51,760
but our crypto puzzles are not meant to like, be like, oh my God, you don't know math,

277
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:52,789
you can't do this.

278
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:55,510
It's more of let us show you

279
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:00,590
kind of some interesting entry level things that slowly evolve into

280
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,590
kind of a intermediate and then into hard

281
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:07,830
and we had a lot of beginners just love it so much

282
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,900
that they worked their way all the way up to the hard stuff

283
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,059
and, and we're willing to hold hands.

284
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,500
It's not always about winning the prizes, you know.

285
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:18,099
So let me ask this then is how many lifetime badges did

286
00:14:18,109 --> 00:14:20,659
you give out at the end of the con last year?

287
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,900
But we had

288
00:14:22,309 --> 00:14:24,820
four contests that were available

289
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,530
to win a lifetime badge.

290
00:14:27,979 --> 00:14:32,210
Um One of them being crack the safe in the safe house.

291
00:14:32,859 --> 00:14:34,989
So there's an actual safe

292
00:14:35,289 --> 00:14:39,330
that to my knowledge has never been opened in recent times.

293
00:14:39,859 --> 00:14:43,789
And I said if anybody opens that safe and whispers the code in my ear

294
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,270
and I go over and pop the safe open,

295
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:48,679
they win a lifetime badge.

296
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,679
Um,

297
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:53,080
nobody was able to pop the safe and, uh,

298
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,369
I've kind of made it my mission to personally make,

299
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,760
made it my mission to open that safe since

300
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:00,520
and nothing is difficult.

301
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:04,090
So I don't blame anybody for not popping that thing open.

302
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:08,880
-- I'm just,
-- I'm curious, is it, so it's like an old time mechanical safe or

303
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:11,380
like a bank vault type deal or

304
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:17,109
it, it, it's like a, it's a, I don't know, like a 3 ft safe by 3 ft,

305
00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:20,590
um, with the old dial on it, the thing is from like

306
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,460
wanna say the forties or fifties.

307
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:25,489
Um,

308
00:15:26,119 --> 00:15:29,570
I found the manual for it but I wasn't, wasn't able, you know,

309
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,299
the default codes didn't work.

310
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:35,359
Um, I thought of sticking an auto dial around there and just dial the crap out of it,

311
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:36,659
just brute force into it.

312
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:38,969
But,

313
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:39,080
uh,

314
00:15:40,859 --> 00:15:42,830
like, I think that might be a little extreme here.

315
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,940
I am sitting in this restaurant for like eight hours waiting for this thing to dial.

316
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:50,679
Right. Right. That's not completely ridiculous.

317
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,390
Uh So, so what are the other, what are the other ones other than the,

318
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,489
uh unbreakable safe?

319
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,929
-- And you, there's three more of them,
-- right.

320
00:15:56,369 --> 00:16:00,140
Yeah. So we had captured the con. So capture the con is,

321
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:04,909
I guess we have all these various villages like hardware hacking village, you know,

322
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:07,270
diffuse a briefcase bomb.

323
00:16:07,619 --> 00:16:10,559
Um uh What else do we have?

324
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,349
We have uh you know, like lock picking where you pick, you know,

325
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,000
um basic medium, hard uh handcuffs behind your back

326
00:16:18,229 --> 00:16:20,460
and you scored points throughout all these villages.

327
00:16:20,469 --> 00:16:22,710
So we essentially gamified cipher cat.

328
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:27,010
And if you moved up and captured the con and the points at the end of it,

329
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,950
the top five people got prizes.

330
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,489
Well, one of the prizes was a lifetime badge.

331
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,580
That badge was indeed given out. So

332
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:37,650
somebody did win the uh lifetime badge

333
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:38,729
um

334
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,400
from capture the time. So we will bring that back for 2017. People loved it.

335
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:45,489
Um They ran around to all the different

336
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,780
villages doing different challenges to win points.

337
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:51,210
We had social points. So people were being introduced to each other.

338
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,289
It just really brought the conference,

339
00:16:53,299 --> 00:16:56,130
uh a whole different feel that I really enjoyed.

340
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,179
Um

341
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:01,200
And then we had our wireless capture the flag.

342
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:06,150
This is run by a guy named Eric Escobar and he won.

343
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:09,608
Um I, I believe two years running Def

344
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,290
Con's wireless capture flag

345
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,329
and he's like,

346
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:18,810
he's like, dude, I, I love, you know, competing in them, but I wanna try running one

347
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,108
and he just,

348
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:23,290
he blew it out apart.

349
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,829
Yeah, I mean, like, you know, what, what do you do when you,

350
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,250
you're the best in the world, right?

351
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,270
You, you jump on the other side

352
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,270
and uh

353
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:34,829
he, he just blows my mind on how well he knows wireless.

354
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:37,979
Like if you have wireless, be fearful of this dude.

355
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:39,930
And so

356
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:44,109
just to confirm, are we talking like wifi or other things than wifi?

357
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:49,109
So we define wireless as anything that transmits through the air? So,

358
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,119
um

359
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,160
I mean, everybody's thinking traditional wireless for your internet.

360
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:59,859
Um But we're thinking, you know, RF we're thinking Boe, we're all over the place.

361
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:02,819
Um And I wanted to expand it because

362
00:18:03,209 --> 00:18:06,739
I want people to get outside their comfort zone when they come to Cipher Con.

363
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,630
I want to be

364
00:18:08,349 --> 00:18:13,219
easy to get outside your comfort zone and find a new, new area to explore.

365
00:18:13,489 --> 00:18:14,439
And um

366
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:18,319
that's kind of like one of the cornerstones of Cipher

367
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:22,140
Con is be comfortable diving into something unknown.

368
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:23,719
That's awesome.

369
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:25,239
And, and number 441,

370
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,109
uh was, it was that

371
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,420
34,

372
00:18:32,189 --> 00:18:32,979
there was the

373
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:33,810
Khan

374
00:18:34,109 --> 00:18:34,800
uh the

375
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:35,150
H

376
00:18:35,459 --> 00:18:35,810
theon,

377
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:38,709
the wireless kept to the flag and

378
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:40,640
-- one
-- more

379
00:18:40,849 --> 00:18:44,979
and I'm, uh, I'm looking through the notes right now.

380
00:18:44,989 --> 00:18:47,469
I cannot, maybe, maybe it was three,

381
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,319
like

382
00:18:48,569 --> 00:18:51,630
the whole thing. The whole thing is like a wedding, right? Like

383
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,199
you don't remember any of it. You look at the pictures after and be like, holy crap.

384
00:18:55,209 --> 00:18:56,109
I did that.

385
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:56,540
Right.

386
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:00,630
-- So
-- that's the crazy thing about running a con, right? Is

387
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,119
I've never put on something to this degree,

388
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:06,680
but I've been involved in various events in the past and

389
00:19:06,689 --> 00:19:09,839
it's like it's so much work and it's completely thankless.

390
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:10,390
So

391
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:10,719
I,

392
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,140
I personally think you're crazy for doing this twice in a row

393
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:17,650
and not like conning someone else just doing it for you.

394
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:20,260
Well, if I'm not crazy for this, it's,

395
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:23,020
it's a separate issue and I'm just straight up crazy.

396
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:23,739
Um

397
00:19:24,219 --> 00:19:27,660
So might as well have an excuse for being crazy, right?

398
00:19:28,989 --> 00:19:32,089
So I guess uh we kind of covered cipher con one point.

399
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:32,280
Oh,

400
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,859
now tell us all about 2.0 what are the new and

401
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:37,930
exciting things we can look forward to this year that,

402
00:19:37,939 --> 00:19:39,140
that maybe weren't there last year.

403
00:19:40,689 --> 00:19:43,099
All right. So safe for count 2.0

404
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:50,849
is gonna be March 30th and 31st and a Child Day on April Fools Day. No joke.

405
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:52,050
So I'm super

406
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:52,739
excited about

407
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,750
actually is uh for those of you who don't know, and I'm gonna,

408
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,319
I'm gonna hijack this for a second.

409
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:57,540
Is

410
00:19:57,869 --> 00:20:03,420
I was at Circle City Con, which is a, a hacker con in Indianapolis, Indiana.

411
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,969
It was, um, I forget when it, when it even was, but

412
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,170
my kids were with me

413
00:20:07,569 --> 00:20:11,469
and they were very kid friendly and my kids had a blast

414
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,329
going around seeing the stuff.

415
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:15,770
They thought it was like the most amazing thing they'd ever done.

416
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:20,010
So, if you have kids bring them with you to this, you will not regret it.

417
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,140
And the craziest thing though is my daughter was seven at the time.

418
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:26,949
She is better at picking locks than I am, which I found terrifying.

419
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,260
So

420
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:31,579
you never know what you're gonna learn, right? When you bring the kids

421
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:37,459
and I recommend if you're bad at picking locks, just get like a um a blowtorch cutter,

422
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:38,060
you know, right.

423
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:40,420
-- Just cut right through that lock. So
-- you

424
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:40,650
heard that

425
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:41,689
uh

426
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,619
when you go to cipher con bring your blow torch cutter?

427
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:50,819
Yeah, and there goes my budget for walks. You,

428
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:53,239
you're not getting that deposit back man.

429
00:20:55,719 --> 00:21:00,209
So um and and let us explain a little bit about the Parent Child Day, right?

430
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:00,979
So we want we,

431
00:21:00,989 --> 00:21:02,550
we call it a Parent Child Day instead of

432
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,359
just a Child Day because we want the adults involved

433
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:08,880
and, and, and we talk about things like

434
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:14,660
online safety that creepy guy online or were supposed, you know,

435
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:19,359
13 year old girl might not be who they say they are.

436
00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:21,079
So, we're trying to teach kids like, you know,

437
00:21:21,089 --> 00:21:23,359
start questioning your surroundings.

438
00:21:23,739 --> 00:21:28,439
Of course, we have, you know, uh, entry-level lock picking, we have Caesar cyclers.

439
00:21:28,449 --> 00:21:32,479
You can break, we have, um, you know, entry-level coding,

440
00:21:32,489 --> 00:21:34,780
you can take apart a computer.

441
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:41,770
We have all sorts of things that just spark our, uh, our youth's mind and, and,

442
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,089
and get them excited about, um, career paths.

443
00:21:44,589 --> 00:21:47,699
Um, We have some interesting speakers that will be announcing soon

444
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:51,810
and uh it's just an overall really exciting time and

445
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:56,390
it's in a children's science museum uh for a venue. So

446
00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:00,329
I guess we should talk about the venue of Cipher Con itself, right?

447
00:22:00,859 --> 00:22:01,689
Yeah. So Cipher

448
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,390
Con

449
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,079
is at Discovery World in Milwaukee.

450
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,000
So

451
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:10,000
those not familiar with Discovery World,

452
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:13,680
it's essentially a building that's on a pier out over Lake Michigan

453
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:15,369
and

454
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:21,849
this building is uh three stories and up on the top is a 360 degree floor

455
00:22:21,859 --> 00:22:24,770
to ceiling window view of all of Lake

456
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,849
Michigan and the skyscrapers of downtown Milwaukee.

457
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,550
It's beautiful.

458
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:32,479
Um And that's probably I'm like

459
00:22:32,939 --> 00:22:35,449
cipher kind has been blast where we've had the f

460
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:37,930
hotel, the Safe House and Discovery World,

461
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:41,180
which I think are like the three best places in town.

462
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,819
So like,

463
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:43,339
I

464
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:49,439
think the the entry level um or the entry ticket of 175 for two days

465
00:22:49,739 --> 00:22:51,579
is worth just the venue itself.

466
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,680
There you go,

467
00:22:53,819 --> 00:22:55,319
sell it, man. Sell it

468
00:22:55,589 --> 00:22:57,750
now. But what are you gonna do when you run out of good?

469
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,699
You, you're using up all the great venues. You gotta have like a couple of

470
00:23:00,869 --> 00:23:04,000
years to get people stoked about, you know, going somewhere new and exciting then.

471
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:04,380
Right.

472
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:09,079
So, I mean, we'll always have excitement and they,

473
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:13,099
Lake Wisconsin has all these amazing venues, um,

474
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,150
um, out even outside of Milwaukee. Right?

475
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,699
So we consider ourselves a Wisconsin hacker conference,

476
00:23:19,709 --> 00:23:21,180
not a Milwaukee hacker conference.

477
00:23:21,189 --> 00:23:22,000
So, uh,

478
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:25,609
you know, it started here in Milwaukee. Um,

479
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:28,969
but I could foresee it jumping to maybe Lambeau Field

480
00:23:28,979 --> 00:23:32,530
in Green Bay and there's some amazing places in Madison.

481
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:35,410
Um So we're kinda keeping our eyes open and,

482
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:36,560
um,

483
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:39,109
see how we scale seeing. Um,

484
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,390
you know, is there more demand than we know about?

485
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,790
It's really hard to judge where we'll end up.

486
00:23:46,189 --> 00:23:51,910
Um We've also been discussing with, uh the Midwest Gaming Classic,

487
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,550
which is an arcade conference gaming, um, the gaming conference

488
00:23:56,979 --> 00:24:01,109
and maybe we'll, maybe we'll co locate with the, with a,

489
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:04,209
a hacker conference and arcade conference at the same time.

490
00:24:04,219 --> 00:24:06,089
So, like that would just blow everybody to mind

491
00:24:08,089 --> 00:24:10,790
just to confirm. So this is like old timey arcade games, like,

492
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:13,619
like the stand up booth ones or?

493
00:24:14,739 --> 00:24:16,880
Yeah, exactly. So it's like,

494
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:19,949
uh, um, you know, just classic arcade.

495
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,300
Um, and there's a lot of hacking involved with that, right?

496
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:25,989
So how do you take these classic arcades and just keep them operating.

497
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,540
There's all this hardware, there's all this software.

498
00:24:28,979 --> 00:24:31,119
-- It, it just gets intense.
-- Oh, man.

499
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:35,479
So I, I was actually at a conference one time that had one of the,

500
00:24:35,489 --> 00:24:39,239
the after parties was they, there's a place you can rent,

501
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,780
like all these old school arcade games. Right.

502
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:45,910
And this guy shows up in a truck and he's like unloading them and I was hanging out and,

503
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,260
you know, talking to him and stuff and

504
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,479
yeah, you're talking about keeping him running is

505
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:52,750
the big thing he's got, is he one of them, he sets up and it didn't work.

506
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,790
So of course, he, like, he tears the thing apart and he's soldering stuff, you know,

507
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,920
on the floor of this hotel.

508
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:59,430
And I'm thinking this is like, completely crazy and he said this is,

509
00:24:59,479 --> 00:25:00,640
you do this all the time

510
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,219
where these things, like, as soon as you touch them, they break because, you know,

511
00:25:04,229 --> 00:25:05,819
the capacitors are old and the,

512
00:25:05,829 --> 00:25:09,130
the C RT S don't quite work and they get out of alignment and like it was just,

513
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,160
it was bonkers how much work this guy did do.

514
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,859
And I just thought like, you've got to love this because

515
00:25:14,239 --> 00:25:17,140
I bet you're, you're making like 75 cents an hour,

516
00:25:17,469 --> 00:25:19,099
you're not dealing with this stuff.

517
00:25:19,709 --> 00:25:23,699
So, like, I'm obviously friends with that circle and, you know,

518
00:25:23,709 --> 00:25:25,699
hang out with them and I'm like, seeing them.

519
00:25:25,709 --> 00:25:30,030
Yeah, solder capacitors on the circuit board. That's like, you know, older than me.

520
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,459
But I'm like, this is awesome.

521
00:25:32,469 --> 00:25:36,760
Like, totally have to, we have to find a way to work together

522
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:37,209
to

523
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:39,459
totally. And, oh, man, I just, I love the

524
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,280
old games too.

525
00:25:40,969 --> 00:25:46,040
I said, hey, you know, maybe for 2018 we can do a co location hack conference,

526
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,589
arcade conference, you know.

527
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,430
Um, and they're like, oh my God, that's awesome. And so

528
00:25:51,739 --> 00:25:53,939
they didn't wanna wait till 2018.

529
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:57,910
So one of our villages this year in 2017

530
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,670
will be game console hacking village run by

531
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,189
our friends at the Midwest Gaming Classic.

532
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,300
They'll be showing off like, you know,

533
00:26:06,349 --> 00:26:10,839
here's how we took this original game and we modified it and now it's, you know,

534
00:26:10,849 --> 00:26:11,930
it's got somebody else, you know,

535
00:26:11,939 --> 00:26:16,099
like their family's heads on the characters in the game or

536
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:20,060
they created a game from scratch. I mean, it's stuff that blows my mind, man.

537
00:26:20,619 --> 00:26:22,060
That'd be so cool.

538
00:26:23,569 --> 00:26:25,699
And then like, it got me thinking, I'm like,

539
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:26,579
you know what?

540
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:29,579
I started off as a kid playing games and that got me

541
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:32,630
excited about the games and then I ended up hacking the game,

542
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:32,949
right?

543
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:33,329
Because

544
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,319
if there's a limitation in the game,

545
00:26:35,459 --> 00:26:37,739
man, I, I had to overcome that.

546
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:38,989
So I started,

547
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:40,900
and I started hacking

548
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:44,619
and a hacker like, I mean, that's overcoming limitations, right?

549
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:49,300
So then, um and this is gonna be a spoiler alert here

550
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:50,520
at Cipher

551
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,930
Con two. We're gonna have electronic badges

552
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:55,790
and it's gonna be the blend of

553
00:26:56,119 --> 00:27:00,189
how everybody got started. So, a blast from the past meets the future,

554
00:27:00,489 --> 00:27:03,770
the electronic badge itself is gonna have a game in it

555
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,449
but the game is gonna have some twists.

556
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,380
Um, but I wanted to show like,

557
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,719
even if you,

558
00:27:09,849 --> 00:27:12,540
you have no, um,

559
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:16,530
passions into hacking or you have zero knowledge,

560
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:19,050
it starts off with a game

561
00:27:19,329 --> 00:27:19,560
and

562
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:26,189
if, if you could play a game it's gonna turn into, um, you don't,

563
00:27:26,199 --> 00:27:29,500
you won't even realize that you're starting to get into hacking as you play the game.

564
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,250
Oh, man. Now, now I wanna see this badge. I'm, uh,

565
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,949
II, I do have my ticket, by the way, I bought it.

566
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:40,410
Um, I think the day you open ticket sales, in fact, just to make sure I got in, you know,

567
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,780
before they all sold out.

568
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:42,459
Right?

569
00:27:42,949 --> 00:27:47,060
Yeah. So these, these badges are gonna be highly sought after. Um,

570
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,060
I mean,

571
00:27:48,369 --> 00:27:50,979
uh, a product child of my group, but I,

572
00:27:50,989 --> 00:27:52,699
I wanna say it's gonna be the best

573
00:27:52,709 --> 00:27:56,420
hacker electronic badge at any hacker conference ever.

574
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,760
And those are big words because that's a competitive area.

575
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:02,760
Oh, man, you're, that, those are fighting words there.

576
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,780
-- You're gonna get shift or something.
-- I don't watch

577
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,260
that.

578
00:28:05,469 --> 00:28:06,339
No, no kidding.

579
00:28:06,939 --> 00:28:07,689
So, uh,

580
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,550
so I guess the game hacking village, um,

581
00:28:11,829 --> 00:28:12,099
that,

582
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:16,339
that's one of 12 villages we're gonna have and villages are just specializations,

583
00:28:16,349 --> 00:28:16,569
right?

584
00:28:16,579 --> 00:28:17,459
So everybody's like,

585
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,319
hey,

586
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,319
Cargo, how can I get more involved with cipher count? And I'm like, all right.

587
00:28:22,329 --> 00:28:25,069
Well, what do you, what do you like doing? They're like, well,

588
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,130
you know, I'm really good at lock picking.

589
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,239
I'm like, cool, go work with the lock picking village

590
00:28:30,739 --> 00:28:33,880
and see what interesting innovative things you can come up with

591
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:34,800
and,

592
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:38,160
and I get these little groups together and let me just

593
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:40,530
read down the list of some of these other villages.

594
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,880
So I said lock picking,

595
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:44,199
we have safe cracking, right? So

596
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:48,560
a lot of conferences put those together, but I feel they're different skill sets,

597
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,229
you know, you can pick a lock.

598
00:28:50,239 --> 00:28:53,650
But getting into a safe requires just a different approach. I can,

599
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,000
you know,

600
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:55,550
in

601
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:59,599
fact, I have never broken into a safe, but I've picked

602
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:02,410
many, many locks. So that, that's awesome.

603
00:29:02,869 --> 00:29:06,829
Well, and come to cipher crime and there'll be some hands on, you can just, you know,

604
00:29:07,099 --> 00:29:09,969
beat, beat on the safe and see if you can manipulate it open.

605
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:13,910
-- I can use the torch I brought to uh, get into the locks
-- right.

606
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:18,890
There you go. And I have to add another budget line. All right.

607
00:29:19,979 --> 00:29:20,260
Yeah.

608
00:29:20,699 --> 00:29:21,449
So, uh

609
00:29:21,729 --> 00:29:23,689
so we have a hardware hacking village.

610
00:29:23,699 --> 00:29:26,380
So we had hard hardware hacking village at Cipher Crow

611
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,050
one.

612
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,969
And um,

613
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,810
and we, you could purchase a kit,

614
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:34,280
put it solder together and you had some kind of device that did something really,

615
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:35,329
really amazing.

616
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:41,459
I'm excited to announce soon. Um we're still working on the details.

617
00:29:41,469 --> 00:29:42,910
Uh So tentatively,

618
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:43,959
um

619
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,579
uh a sponsor might be purchasing all the kits

620
00:29:46,589 --> 00:29:49,060
so you can put these kits together for free.

621
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,699
So I'm really excited about that.

622
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:52,599
Can't wait to announce that one.

623
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,979
So again, we have uh Escobar running uh wireless capture the flag for a contest,

624
00:29:57,989 --> 00:30:02,780
but we also have him uh on standby at a wireless hacking village.

625
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:05,819
So he can actually explain and show you how to defeat, you know,

626
00:30:05,829 --> 00:30:07,260
limitations and wireless

627
00:30:07,829 --> 00:30:11,859
new this year is car hacking village. I mean, that's, you know,

628
00:30:12,089 --> 00:30:16,619
with all this automation of, uh, you know, self driving vehicles,

629
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:19,300
like let's get those things secure first before

630
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,310
somebody slamming on your brakes on a highway.

631
00:30:22,609 --> 00:30:23,209
Um

632
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:25,310
Yeah, no kidding.

633
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,469
It's a little frightening but, you know,

634
00:30:27,819 --> 00:30:30,869
at least it might stop half the people from texting while they're driving.

635
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,359
But,

636
00:30:32,739 --> 00:30:36,140
uh, um we have vintage system hacking village.

637
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,859
So it's our friends at the uh Chicago Classic

638
00:30:38,979 --> 00:30:43,660
uh computing. Um That's a conference that focuses on vintage systems.

639
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:46,550
Like, you know, we're talking about like Wise Edition Mac

640
00:30:47,489 --> 00:30:48,339
and uh

641
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:50,540
just really old school systems.

642
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:54,739
Like that's hacking in itself, just like the, the old arcades.

643
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,930
You gotta, you gotta hack these systems together.

644
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:57,670
We'll

645
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,699
uh be jail breaking an Apple two, right?

646
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,400
Yeah, I mean, they, they've done some incredible stuff. Right. Getting,

647
00:31:04,699 --> 00:31:07,040
getting II, I mean, I guess come to the village,

648
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:09,670
I'm not a specialist on all these areas, but

649
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:14,839
like playing some of these games that you played in, like the early eighties.

650
00:31:14,849 --> 00:31:19,530
Um, the actual hardware from the eighties is just, uh,

651
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,760
it just brings back so many cool memories.

652
00:31:23,869 --> 00:31:24,380
Um,

653
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,719
and, uh,

654
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,520
uh, we have, uh Espionage Village.

655
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:33,099
So, Espionage Village is, um, kind of a, you know, it's,

656
00:31:33,109 --> 00:31:35,189
there's always gonna be that piece of espionage.

657
00:31:35,199 --> 00:31:36,640
Uh, as far as I know,

658
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:40,359
we're the only hacker conference that has like an espionage twist to it.

659
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:41,719
Um,

660
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,729
this year we're focusing on, um,

661
00:31:46,069 --> 00:31:51,329
the Milwaukee area on the summer fest grounds, uh which is the big music festival,

662
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,890
uh, used to have

663
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:56,930
night missiles with nuclear tips. And, um,

664
00:31:57,949 --> 00:32:02,449
it's gonna be hopefully some speakers discussing, um,

665
00:32:02,459 --> 00:32:05,329
what it was like to operate some of those anti, uh,

666
00:32:05,619 --> 00:32:07,180
anti aircraft youtuber

667
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,579
missiles.

668
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:09,180
It just

669
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,290
blows my mind.

670
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:10,640
Thank

671
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:10,989
goodness.

672
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:11,390
Right.

673
00:32:12,979 --> 00:32:13,689
Yeah.

674
00:32:13,989 --> 00:32:14,160
Well,

675
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:18,109
you know, it, it's just crazy how, like in the fifties,

676
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:20,290
like downtown Milwaukee had nukes.

677
00:32:20,969 --> 00:32:24,729
-- That's crazy.
-- I didn't know that. Oh, my goodness. That's, oh my.

678
00:32:25,189 --> 00:32:25,260
I

679
00:32:25,449 --> 00:32:29,449
remember reading about this. It was, it was like doctor strange love

680
00:32:29,619 --> 00:32:31,000
levels of insanity

681
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:34,319
because like there was no other option, right? Like,

682
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:35,810
oh

683
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:40,479
yeah, just put it in the show notes, the Nike Zeus missile system. It's, it's like

684
00:32:40,969 --> 00:32:42,939
so completely insane.

685
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,660
I, I believe it is still the fastest, like,

686
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:48,540
it's the most fast accelerating thing man has ever made

687
00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:50,910
is the missile itself.

688
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,099
So, uh

689
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:59,619
they, they, they told everybody that these missiles on the summer fest grounds.

690
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,189
So when you're at the music festival at

691
00:33:01,199 --> 00:33:03,619
Summerfest and you see all the concrete everywhere.

692
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,250
It's eerie to know there's bunkers underneath.

693
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:07,890
And, uh,

694
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,319
so

695
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,479
these

696
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:13,400
nukes they told the, the public like, oh, don't worry,

697
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:17,729
this is protection from Milwaukee and Chicago against the Russians flying, um,

698
00:33:17,739 --> 00:33:19,589
aircraft over Lake Michigan.

699
00:33:20,069 --> 00:33:20,770
Right.

700
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,979
We're gonna, we, we find

701
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,180
out

702
00:33:24,439 --> 00:33:25,760
and we find out later

703
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,810
that

704
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:29,329
three suburbs of Milwaukee

705
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:34,069
actually have the full on like missile targeted on Moscow,

706
00:33:34,449 --> 00:33:36,079
like right here. So

707
00:33:36,869 --> 00:33:39,599
the, the, the defense of the city was kind of secondary,

708
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,589
right?

709
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:45,250
It's just people we can replace them, you know,

710
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,449
that's so crazy.

711
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:51,729
So I'm always gonna have like kind of a, like a touch of espionage. Um

712
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,869
And I guess for full disclosure,

713
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,369
I'm on the board of directors for the Cold War Museum.

714
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,410
So you're gonna feel that

715
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:00,030
nice. That, that's cool too.

716
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,400
We should have you back to talk about that, that at some time.

717
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,119
-- But
-- anyway, man,

718
00:34:04,449 --> 00:34:06,189
no, nobody will sleep.

719
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:10,870
That's all right. We're, we're security people.

720
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,879
We, we have enough trouble sleeping as it is

721
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,830
totally. Um So another village we have is privacy invasion village.

722
00:34:17,668 --> 00:34:21,108
So there's privacy and crypto villages at other places.

723
00:34:21,118 --> 00:34:24,029
But I wanted to demonstrate like here are the different

724
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:27,768
ways and how easy it is to invade somebody's privacy.

725
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:30,378
So I'm still working in the disclaimer,

726
00:34:30,388 --> 00:34:34,079
um that I'll have when you walk into the conference to make sure like, hey,

727
00:34:34,089 --> 00:34:36,248
everybody's got the heads up that, you know,

728
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:37,529
it's gonna get creepy.

729
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:39,958
But uh

730
00:34:40,438 --> 00:34:43,458
we have some exciting ideas for privacy invasion village that I

731
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:45,510
don't wanna tell you guys because I would give it away.

732
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,750
I, I don't wanna know like this is one of those things.

733
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,139
I just know I'm,

734
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:54,080
I would not go in there or talk to any of those people because I know what they can do.

735
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:57,020
And I'm just gonna put, this is like not going to the doctor because you know,

736
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,350
you're going to die, right?

737
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,139
Like just no,

738
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:04,419
and, and, and truly, um coming to this conference is all like

739
00:35:04,939 --> 00:35:07,000
it, it's a, it's a learning experience

740
00:35:07,459 --> 00:35:10,320
but it, it's safe, it's like a safe environment.

741
00:35:10,489 --> 00:35:11,159
Um

742
00:35:11,399 --> 00:35:12,520
You come to cipher

743
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:13,570
Khan to

744
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,800
be in this

745
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,239
uh exercise or this, this

746
00:35:19,399 --> 00:35:24,080
safe place to experiment on stuff that in reality

747
00:35:24,479 --> 00:35:28,239
is very scary or intimidating.

748
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,159
You come to cipher

749
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,770
Khan to, to

750
00:35:31,979 --> 00:35:33,209
just practice

751
00:35:33,659 --> 00:35:34,659
and to learn.

752
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:35,679
Um,

753
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,820
and there, there should be nothing intimidated. No, nobody should be intimidated.

754
00:35:40,659 --> 00:35:40,729
No,

755
00:35:40,879 --> 00:35:41,020
I,

756
00:35:41,989 --> 00:35:46,379
-- I'm terrified. Right. There's a huge difference isn't
-- terrified.

757
00:35:46,389 --> 00:35:49,969
-- The default setting for most security
-- people. Oh, it is. I know.

758
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,780
I know. Unfortunately.

759
00:35:52,899 --> 00:35:54,919
-- Anyway, and,
-- and I mean, we have,

760
00:35:54,929 --> 00:35:59,510
we have people that attend that just come for the social, um, you know, have a Drake,

761
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,159
see some cool stuff.

762
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,320
Um,

763
00:36:02,649 --> 00:36:06,719
you know, and then we have other people that come in and, and see the talks. Right.

764
00:36:06,729 --> 00:36:09,159
We have 25 speakers for year too.

765
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,570
You know, there, there's something for everyone and,

766
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,439
and if there's not something for you, we have food and beer.

767
00:36:15,449 --> 00:36:18,780
So that might, that might, who am I missing at that point?

768
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:21,280
-- There's something for everyone at that point.
-- Right.

769
00:36:22,689 --> 00:36:25,310
And I guess, let, let, let's talk about some of these speakers.

770
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,929
We have, uh,

771
00:36:27,459 --> 00:36:27,989
Richard, the,

772
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:31,320
who has spoke at every decon

773
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:35,310
except for two. So Defcon has been around for 25 years.

774
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,669
Um

775
00:36:37,379 --> 00:36:39,550
He, he's actually a local to Wisconsin

776
00:36:39,709 --> 00:36:41,919
and a lot of people aren't aware of that.

777
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:43,899
And uh

778
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:45,489
we have

779
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,409
my friends from Canada. So shout out to Canada there.

780
00:36:49,649 --> 00:36:50,429
Um

781
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,010
Hey,

782
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,659
come on, Kurt, here's your chance, man. Jump

783
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:53,879
on that

784
00:36:54,689 --> 00:36:57,219
because so Wisconsin is big on cheese curd.

785
00:36:57,229 --> 00:36:59,199
So like, do you guys have poutine down there?

786
00:36:59,209 --> 00:37:02,489
We don't, we don't, we uh we do, we do deep fry them though,

787
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,969
but we don't uh pour gravy on top of them.

788
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:10,860
It totally seems like something Wisconsin should be eating because

789
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:13,149
Wisconsin is like the worst diet on the planet.

790
00:37:13,459 --> 00:37:17,110
So I'm surprised poutine isn't something we eat here. I, I,

791
00:37:17,229 --> 00:37:18,110
yeah, because I mean,

792
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:23,979
there are few ways to make French fries more unhealthy and poutine is one of the few.

793
00:37:25,969 --> 00:37:27,209
So, um

794
00:37:27,439 --> 00:37:31,129
I mean, you say worst diet. I, I say best diet. So it's,

795
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:31,770
you know,

796
00:37:31,919 --> 00:37:33,510
Toma tomato, tomato.

797
00:37:34,929 --> 00:37:40,189
Yes. Our, our waist sizes show how, how best it is. Right.

798
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,209
That's, that's true.

799
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,550
I could, I could probably jump on the treadmill a little bit more.

800
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,770
Um

801
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,070
Anyway, so, so our friends from Canada

802
00:37:50,209 --> 00:37:52,800
in Sydney and uh friend Melanie are

803
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:55,889
gonna be speaking on brain based authentication.

804
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,010
So instead of using, you know,

805
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:01,570
your finger for biometrics or typing in your password,

806
00:38:01,689 --> 00:38:04,800
like what if the unique configuration of your

807
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:07,169
brain allowed you to log into your computer?

808
00:38:07,929 --> 00:38:08,709
So,

809
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,860
it, it's a fascinating concept and I can't wait to see, um,

810
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,989
what they have in store for us for this talk.

811
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:20,750
I'm like, I'm like, 50% scared of, of this one for, for not any reason I can justify

812
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:22,320
other than it's, it's just

813
00:38:22,449 --> 00:38:25,790
let's combine this with your, uh privacy invasion village.

814
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,739
And I think we're, we're

815
00:38:27,919 --> 00:38:29,310
on the right path here. Right?

816
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:32,689
And, and we're, we have bio hacking village also

817
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,389
and, um,

818
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:37,699
they're a big aspect of the bio hacking village

819
00:38:38,209 --> 00:38:39,429
and that

820
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:42,510
can you use electrical currents

821
00:38:42,969 --> 00:38:45,909
to go through to your skull and modify

822
00:38:45,919 --> 00:38:48,699
your brain and set up electrical connections that

823
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:53,090
don't normally exist in, um, what nature I guess

824
00:38:53,659 --> 00:38:58,310
they may or may not be having a device that would do this on site.

825
00:38:58,959 --> 00:38:59,639
So

826
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:02,379
I think prepare your brains for this.

827
00:39:02,399 --> 00:39:08,080
Science fiction has shown that messing with someone's brain always ends well.

828
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:08,590
Right.

829
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,570
Absolutely. Absolutely.

830
00:39:11,439 --> 00:39:15,129
So, I, it's interesting that, um, you bring up science fiction, right?

831
00:39:15,139 --> 00:39:18,659
So that we have so many aspects of science fiction and

832
00:39:19,209 --> 00:39:20,879
year two's theme.

833
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:24,120
So we just announced this theme about a week ago

834
00:39:24,699 --> 00:39:28,219
and the theme for year two is called Fringe Science.

835
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,570
So we figured we're in a ma

836
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,020
a science museum

837
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,989
and we're touching on all these fringes, right? Like,

838
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,459
like cybersecurity

839
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:43,750
or, or, or iot or anything that we're dabbling in in this career path

840
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:47,020
like we didn't exist 10

841
00:39:47,189 --> 00:39:49,389
or at most 20 years ago, right?

842
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:54,219
Our career path is so new that we're on the fringe of,

843
00:39:54,489 --> 00:39:59,050
of all these different methodologies and these sciences and these

844
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,300
attack methods.

845
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:04,649
So we think it's fitting to do fringe science

846
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:06,620
for

847
00:40:06,939 --> 00:40:08,969
-- you.
-- That's fantastic actually.

848
00:40:08,979 --> 00:40:12,830
And this is something that Kurt and I talk about on a regular basis is the fact that

849
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:14,909
security is still, I mean,

850
00:40:14,919 --> 00:40:16,989
we always like to think about it as kind of being old

851
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,070
because a lot of us have been in the industry for maybe,

852
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,080
you know, 10 or more years.

853
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:23,139
But in reality, compared to most mature industries,

854
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,870
we are brand new

855
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:27,629
and we don't know what the heck is going on.

856
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:28,080
And in fact,

857
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:30,250
this is something that I've started doing some research on and I

858
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,550
keep talking about this and I have to stop at some point.

859
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,030
But like

860
00:40:33,449 --> 00:40:33,949
I,

861
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:36,790
I started writing a blog post to compare

862
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:42,629
uh security to the kind of worker safety in, in the industrial revolution.

863
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,000
And I've gone down this insane rat hole because it turns out

864
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:49,340
if you look at literally like every part of human history,

865
00:40:49,469 --> 00:40:55,199
we let things get like on fire, everyone's dying bad before we even care.

866
00:40:55,399 --> 00:40:58,659
And so when, when I hear like Bruce and I are going and talk to Congress being like, oh,

867
00:40:58,669 --> 00:41:02,459
we have to care about iot it's like they don't care right

868
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,239
until like half of the population is dying because of their pacemakers.

869
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,219
Like nobody is going to care.

870
00:41:08,419 --> 00:41:10,060
Which is terrifying

871
00:41:10,379 --> 00:41:11,919
because I don't want to give up.

872
00:41:11,929 --> 00:41:15,550
But I don't, I don't think we're gonna fix this one any time soon.

873
00:41:15,929 --> 00:41:16,959
Yeah, it's, uh,

874
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:22,800
I mean, so one of the reasons why I'm pulling in the Cold War is like,

875
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,600
what happened in the Cold War is repeating itself now in Cyber War.

876
00:41:27,739 --> 00:41:29,199
And, um, I'm, I'm,

877
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,040
I'm just trying to

878
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,840
demonstrate like, like this is not different.

879
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:36,820
Wow,

880
00:41:36,929 --> 00:41:39,209
that's really true. Actually, we should,

881
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,639
I wonder if anyone's done that where they've kind of

882
00:41:41,649 --> 00:41:45,379
gone through the parallels of the Cold War compared to today

883
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,620
because I, I imagine it's

884
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:50,040
horrifying how things line up.

885
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:51,939
Uh In fact, I don't know if you guys have ever read, there's,

886
00:41:51,949 --> 00:41:53,739
there's a book out there called Ghost Fleet

887
00:41:53,879 --> 00:41:58,659
where it's this author kind of does like a future war concept

888
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:01,840
where it's all very, you know, electronic and, and the uh

889
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,590
the Chinese attack

890
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:04,580
America.

891
00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:08,020
And they, they basically because they built everything they, like,

892
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:10,030
take over all the computers and ruin them all, you know,

893
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,429
it's kind of a bit Battlestar Galactica in that respect where they're like crap.

894
00:42:13,439 --> 00:42:15,239
We have to use all the old garbage now because all the

895
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:18,270
new stuff has been taken over by the bad guys and it's

896
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:21,300
part of it. I, I chuckled at and part of it, it's like this is,

897
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:24,790
this could happen because it's exactly true.

898
00:42:24,969 --> 00:42:26,820
I mean, to some degree it's already happening.

899
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:27,820
I mean, those, you know,

900
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:31,149
there's been a couple of big cybersecurity attack incidents now, you know, like,

901
00:42:31,419 --> 00:42:33,510
what was it last week in Saudi Arabia? Right.

902
00:42:33,699 --> 00:42:35,590
And I can't help but wonder how much of this, you know,

903
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,790
it's kind of like those proxy wars we used to fight,

904
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:39,949
-- you know, in the Cold
-- War still fight.

905
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:42,070
Well, yeah, granted.

906
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:45,979
So it's, it's, and you hit, it, hit the nail right on the head.

907
00:42:45,989 --> 00:42:50,510
Um, these nation States can blame individual, any hackers

908
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:54,010
and, and get away with doing stuff that would

909
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:58,689
spark wars. But they say, oh, that wasn't us. That was that group anonymous, right.

910
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:01,899
It, it, it gets really bizarre really fast

911
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,590
and, and actually, um, funny you say that because, you know,

912
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,909
I'm gonna ruin this for most of you, but I won't ruin it.

913
00:43:06,969 --> 00:43:10,510
But, uh, Anonymous is a character in the book, Ghost Fleet,

914
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:12,419
which I found extra hilarious.

915
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,550
Right. Right.

916
00:43:14,989 --> 00:43:15,449
It's always,

917
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:17,979
it's always that anonymous person online that just

918
00:43:17,989 --> 00:43:19,790
ruins it for all the Nation States.

919
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,159
Right.

920
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:22,260
That's right. That's right. They

921
00:43:22,409 --> 00:43:22,479
do.

922
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:26,219
I've always wondered how with a straight face we claim that there's this

923
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,439
cohesive group called Anonymous who

924
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,909
has no aim or, you know, like,

925
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:33,520
doesn't

926
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:35,860
have a structure and yet somehow they're co

927
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,620
cohesive and we call them anonymous. You know,

928
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,719
it, it seems rather strange to me.

929
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:44,689
I don't think we have time to cover that one

930
00:43:46,479 --> 00:43:47,429
-- maybe next
-- week.

931
00:43:48,649 --> 00:43:52,899
Well, I, I guess I can give another little teaser of what's coming up for cipher con.

932
00:43:52,909 --> 00:43:58,550
Uh, based on this is we hired a film crew to put a little promo video together

933
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:04,760
and we're kind of taking the little teases of like, uh f society from Mr Robot

934
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:09,459
and, um anonymous with the whole V for vendetta mask.

935
00:44:09,699 --> 00:44:11,590
And we're doing our own little twist on that

936
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:16,530
and it's essentially gonna be a recruitment video for cipher con, right?

937
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:17,250
Like, like,

938
00:44:17,919 --> 00:44:18,429
you know,

939
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:22,110
I, I, it shows somebody going through the process of

940
00:44:22,429 --> 00:44:26,669
one of the, uh, the puzzles that we have crypto puzzles on our website, right?

941
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:28,040
Anybody can go play with them.

942
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:30,270
Um, you know, we'll help you through it.

943
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,750
It's kind of like a little fun thing between the conferences, right?

944
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,629
And this is a

945
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,699
devoted hacker

946
00:44:37,919 --> 00:44:41,780
that, uh, you know, jumps up, spray, paints a camera, you know,

947
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:43,429
does a little picking.

948
00:44:43,689 --> 00:44:46,860
Um, it, it's gonna be a really intense video

949
00:44:46,989 --> 00:44:47,979
and, uh

950
00:44:48,379 --> 00:44:52,370
I'm excited for uh its release probably mid January

951
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:53,300
now.

952
00:44:54,729 --> 00:44:56,919
Not only is it really cool. Right.

953
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,739
But it, it, it focuses on the emphasis that cipher

954
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,179
con has beyond traditional hacking

955
00:45:02,709 --> 00:45:03,570
is we're,

956
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:07,600
we're trying to reach out to people interested that have various skill sets.

957
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:11,010
Right. So here's a, here's, here's a film crew and a film director

958
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:13,280
that does all this artistic stuff.

959
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:18,889
Um We're also looking for artists that wanna show the hacker culture and visuals.

960
00:45:18,899 --> 00:45:20,070
There's um

961
00:45:20,189 --> 00:45:22,909
a, a friend of mine is gonna be playing music at Cipher Con.

962
00:45:22,919 --> 00:45:24,649
It's, you know, hacker music.

963
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,729
Um We're looking for all the different mindsets that

964
00:45:28,229 --> 00:45:31,050
I is considered hackers. Like,

965
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:33,530
you know, like, like for

966
00:45:33,669 --> 00:45:36,500
some bio hackers, they say, oh, you know, I'm not really a hacker.

967
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:39,159
I don't break the networks, I don't get into servers.

968
00:45:39,409 --> 00:45:40,000
And I'm like,

969
00:45:40,129 --> 00:45:43,169
but you're hacking your body. Like that's crazy.

970
00:45:43,179 --> 00:45:46,409
That's like you're more hacker than some of the traditional hackers.

971
00:45:46,899 --> 00:45:48,219
And II, I want,

972
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:51,909
I wanna reach out to these artists, these hacker artists

973
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:55,800
and I wanna see these, these fringe um

974
00:45:56,199 --> 00:46:01,449
these fringe hacker cultural representations.

975
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:07,179
Um A and this film should be like one of, one of the big pieces of saying like,

976
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:11,959
Cipher comes beyond the traditional hacking and getting into this new fringe

977
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:16,560
mindsets. And that's how we need to look at this discipline, right?

978
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,580
We have to look at it beyond.

979
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:22,159
Just let's break into a server and oh my God, we own somebody.

980
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,120
I it's,

981
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,120
it's a culture, it's a group of people. It's a family

982
00:46:27,429 --> 00:46:28,239
and, uh,

983
00:46:29,139 --> 00:46:30,979
I think you're gonna see a lot of that coming up.

984
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:32,280
That's awesome, man.

985
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:36,110
One thing I gotta ask, uh, are you gonna be releasing any of the sort of,

986
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:38,709
uh, parent and kids stuff

987
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:39,689
publicly?

988
00:46:39,699 --> 00:46:43,389
Because like, I've actually caught one of my sons who at the time was five years old.

989
00:46:43,399 --> 00:46:44,800
He was banging away at my laptop

990
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:47,780
and I'm like, Felix. Uh, what are you doing? And he's like,

991
00:46:48,149 --> 00:46:50,000
I'm finding the password and I'm like,

992
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:54,520
I, I just had the moment I was so happy. Right? And at the same time, I was kind of like,

993
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:54,800
oh,

994
00:46:55,189 --> 00:46:55,810
um

995
00:46:56,399 --> 00:46:59,409
but, you know, because he seems to have that

996
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:02,540
he understands like if he gets the pin number to somebody's phone,

997
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:04,879
he can use that person's phone and play games on it, right?

998
00:47:04,889 --> 00:47:05,169
So

999
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:09,250
he's pretty like he's quite seriously motivated to, you know,

1000
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,889
to break into stuff because he wants to play games on it or whatever.

1001
00:47:12,149 --> 00:47:14,139
And, and so I've kind of been wondering about, you know,

1002
00:47:14,149 --> 00:47:15,770
resources for kids like that.

1003
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:20,129
-- Yeah.
-- So our heck kids event, the tickets are available right now.

1004
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:24,239
Um We're putting together a little bit more

1005
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:26,979
details regarding the agenda of the event.

1006
00:47:27,479 --> 00:47:28,139
Um

1007
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:30,590
So if you wanna blindly trust us,

1008
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,550
uh you can buy a ticket now and we'll guarantee you'll be happy.

1009
00:47:33,909 --> 00:47:38,580
Um or um in the next uh probably week,

1010
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:41,459
we'll be starting our marketing campaign of saying like,

1011
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:43,860
you know, hey, um

1012
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:45,820
you wanna take your kid

1013
00:47:45,989 --> 00:47:49,139
and show him some of these really awesome stem

1014
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:53,510
subjects here at uh the Discovery World Science Museum, right?

1015
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:54,590
And um

1016
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,620
hang out with some really cool hackers and the adults will have fun.

1017
00:47:57,629 --> 00:47:58,850
The Children all have fun.

1018
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:02,790
Um But yeah, wait, wait for those details in probably a week.

1019
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,949
We're really, really close to the quality control that we are known for.

1020
00:48:07,959 --> 00:48:10,429
So we wanna make sure it's solid before we let you know.

1021
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:15,580
Nice. That's fantastic. Cool. All right. So we're uh we're coming to the end here.

1022
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:19,050
So I guess Michael, is there anything else you think that,

1023
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:22,260
that the folks out there need to know about cipher con?

1024
00:48:22,439 --> 00:48:23,090
So

1025
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:24,979
we have one speaker

1026
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:26,320
named John

1027
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:29,409
Platas and he's a former colleague of mine

1028
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:33,639
and he is speaking on predictive analytics

1029
00:48:34,169 --> 00:48:35,760
and in a lot of cases,

1030
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:39,600
we already know what you guys are looking for and we're gonna deliver it.

1031
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,399
So I just let him run his computers and,

1032
00:48:42,659 --> 00:48:47,280
and, and, and soak up all that knowledge from you guys using your

1033
00:48:47,399 --> 00:48:49,949
uh your social media credentials. And

1034
00:48:50,399 --> 00:48:55,060
so we're potentially stalking you and we're gonna deliver exactly what you,

1035
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:57,159
you hope to see at cipher console.

1036
00:48:57,169 --> 00:48:59,939
Make sure you do buy a ticket so we can deliver that right to you.

1037
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:02,020
That's crazy.

1038
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,330
That's the future

1039
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:03,560
man.

1040
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:07,050
-- Tell me what
-- to sell you.

1041
00:49:07,209 --> 00:49:08,939
It's still terrifying. Kirk. I, I

1042
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:13,570
do, I want my illusion a free choice even though I know it's fake. I want it right.

1043
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:14,290
I need that.

1044
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:17,610
-- Amazon says you should buy
-- this and you're right.

1045
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:19,810
But I still want to pretend I made that decision.

1046
00:49:20,929 --> 00:49:22,929
Hind hindsight is 2020.

1047
00:49:22,939 --> 00:49:27,760
But like if you can start predicting with some degree of accuracy of what you

1048
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:30,879
want and then deliver it to you before you even know you want it.

1049
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:32,879
I think that's pretty awesome.

1050
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,560
-- Alright.
-- Anyway, that's

1051
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:36,909
I

1052
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:38,219
think about this right now.

1053
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:39,350
So uh

1054
00:49:39,649 --> 00:49:40,209
so after,

1055
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:40,929
after we,

1056
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,679
yeah, after we hang up on this call,

1057
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:46,250
I'm guessing you're really hungry for a cheeseburger, aren't you?

1058
00:49:46,979 --> 00:49:48,989
I'm I'm pretty sure you're gonna go get a cheeseburger.

1059
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:52,090
I'm I'm ok. Actually I just hate suffer not long ago,

1060
00:49:52,219 --> 00:49:53,560
-- so
-- I'm
-- fine. I'm fine.

1061
00:49:53,709 --> 00:49:54,479
-- Yep. Yep.
-- You're

1062
00:49:57,229 --> 00:50:00,629
wanting a cheeseburger is essentially my default setting. So.

1063
00:50:02,939 --> 00:50:03,939
All right. All right, Mike.

1064
00:50:03,949 --> 00:50:07,699
So we have something fun to do at the very end here is before we go,

1065
00:50:07,889 --> 00:50:10,850
we have a lightning round for you two minutes.

1066
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:13,090
We have a bunch of questions you've never seen

1067
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:16,209
and feel free to just skip them if you want.

1068
00:50:17,419 --> 00:50:18,969
-- Yeah,
-- you can just say skip. That's the

1069
00:50:19,139 --> 00:50:19,229
ski

1070
00:50:19,989 --> 00:50:20,229
here we are.

1071
00:50:20,389 --> 00:50:24,060
So for our listeners, this is shamelessly stolen from George Strombolis

1072
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,090
who is a Canadian TV celebrity. I

1073
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:29,310
I'm not making this up. Ok, like go Google it.

1074
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:34,060
Of course, nobody outside Canada has any clue who he is. But um, yeah, so

1075
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:36,679
if you don't like it or if it's weird

1076
00:50:37,979 --> 00:50:38,320
anyway.

1077
00:50:38,479 --> 00:50:39,120
All right. All right.

1078
00:50:40,169 --> 00:50:40,909
You got a timer.

1079
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:42,510
Yeah, I got my visual timer

1080
00:50:42,919 --> 00:50:46,989
which is not helpful as this is a writer of the mind, right?

1081
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:53,590
So everyone imagine a timer in your head, which is set to two minutes

1082
00:50:54,159 --> 00:50:56,709
and we will hit start and then it will count down.

1083
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:58,439
OK. So who's asking you or me?

1084
00:50:58,810 --> 00:50:59,699
I will,

1085
00:50:59,709 --> 00:51:04,100
I will let you ask the questions as long as you believe you can also work the timer.

1086
00:51:04,959 --> 00:51:05,110
OK.

1087
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:09,389
It's a visual timer. Everybody. So pay attention.

1088
00:51:10,439 --> 00:51:12,939
All right, starting now. All right.

1089
00:51:13,409 --> 00:51:17,250
Well, you mentioned earlier. So what's your favorite dead operating system?

1090
00:51:17,879 --> 00:51:17,909
Oh,

1091
00:51:18,879 --> 00:51:21,060
I'm gonna skip that one. That one's dangerous.

1092
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:22,760
OK. Uh

1093
00:51:23,169 --> 00:51:24,790
Maybe something a bit easier.

1094
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:27,120
-- Uh Picard or Kirk. Uh
-- I'd

1095
00:51:27,379 --> 00:51:28,639
kill them both.

1096
00:51:30,649 --> 00:51:33,149
All right. Uh Your favorite open source project.

1097
00:51:33,409 --> 00:51:34,429
Um Me

1098
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:35,100
exploit,

1099
00:51:37,929 --> 00:51:40,199
uh Your favorite Rs. A key size.

1100
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,280
I'll just stick with 256

1101
00:51:43,879 --> 00:51:44,919
256 Rs.

1102
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:49,179
A man that's embarrassed like you could crack that in real time on a phone.

1103
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:53,649
Well, it, it's my favorite for other people to have. OK.

1104
00:51:53,949 --> 00:51:57,909
-- That's fair. I, I'll let that one go.
-- I guess we gotta clarify that question in

1105
00:51:58,159 --> 00:51:58,360
future.

1106
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:02,780
-- Um Here's a question. Do you encrypt your email?
-- Uh

1107
00:52:02,989 --> 00:52:05,570
I encrypt my email but yours is wide open. P

1108
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:12,159
All right. Uh Here's a good one, favorite movie portrayal of hacking.

1109
00:52:13,489 --> 00:52:17,159
Uh Oh, I have to go with the original hackers. I mean, that's just

1110
00:52:17,449 --> 00:52:21,629
-- classic, man.
-- That movie is phenomenal. I love that movie so much.

1111
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,229
OK.

1112
00:52:23,409 --> 00:52:25,100
And then, um

1113
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:29,219
uh well, here's a good one. What's your favorite or most? In your opinion?

1114
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,969
Your most insecure language,

1115
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:32,500
programming language?

1116
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:35,459
Oh God, there's so many.

1117
00:52:35,669 --> 00:52:36,560
Um

1118
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:38,229
I'm

1119
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:39,550
gonna go back to my,

1120
00:52:39,919 --> 00:52:43,889
my original was Pascal. I'm gonna stick with Pascal.

1121
00:52:44,469 --> 00:52:45,050
All right.

1122
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:49,290
And uh OK, what's your favorite? Um

1123
00:52:49,459 --> 00:52:50,530
Dead Protocol?

1124
00:52:51,219 --> 00:52:52,169
Uh

1125
00:52:52,409 --> 00:52:54,110
-- Nothing
-- ever Dies. Kurt. You should know that by

1126
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:54,360
now.

1127
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:58,889
Yeah, like, like dead. I'm like questioning what's really dead.

1128
00:52:59,330 --> 00:52:59,659
Nothing like,

1129
00:53:00,739 --> 00:53:01,209
like

1130
00:53:01,429 --> 00:53:04,090
beyond that, we're gonna go with like apple talk.

1131
00:53:05,959 --> 00:53:08,139
Good one. All right. Well, that's our two minute timer.

1132
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:12,030
There's no noise. No one can see it. Kurt. You need it to make

1133
00:53:12,179 --> 00:53:12,669
noise

1134
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:16,679
-- right. There we go. Ding. All right. Yay. Well done.
-- Well, I put my phone on silent

1135
00:53:17,489 --> 00:53:17,689
10

1136
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:18,080
points.

1137
00:53:18,489 --> 00:53:18,919
So

1138
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:20,070
you're done.

1139
00:53:22,219 --> 00:53:26,120
Awesome. All right, Michael Cargo. Thank you so much.

1140
00:53:26,129 --> 00:53:29,199
It has been awesome having this chat. I'm very excited for

1141
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:29,389
Cypher.

1142
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:33,760
I'm even more excited now after talking to you and I'm sad. I have to wait,

1143
00:53:33,939 --> 00:53:37,840
but I guess folks out there, uh, buy your tickets, buy them early, buy them often

1144
00:53:38,479 --> 00:53:39,120
and

1145
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:41,399
you don't have to worry.

1146
00:53:41,709 --> 00:53:44,620
You can go try those cipher puzzles on Cipher

1147
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:48,540
-- con.com. It's
-- easy to do that though. I want, I want someone to spoon

1148
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:48,879
feed.

1149
00:53:48,989 --> 00:53:49,850
You need like,

1150
00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:53,719
like some version of it that just kind of solves it for me right where where I

1151
00:53:53,729 --> 00:53:55,629
can pretend I'm doing something and then it

1152
00:53:55,639 --> 00:53:57,300
just gives me the answer after five minutes.

1153
00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:01,889
So, you said your, your, your five year old was trying to break into your, uh,

1154
00:54:01,899 --> 00:54:02,850
your computer.

1155
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:07,050
But we have like, 10 and 12 year olds cracking these crypto puzzles on our website.

1156
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:10,250
So you gotta stop embarrassing yourself and go try.

1157
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,179
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's fair. Uh, I guess,

1158
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:16,449
uh, little housekeeping then is. So, uh, how much is the ticket?

1159
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:20,689
Uh, 175 and we throw some snacks at you. It's a two day.

1160
00:54:21,409 --> 00:54:24,379
Nice. Very cool. And they can go to Cipher

1161
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,760
con.com

1162
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,709
and purchase a ticket with

1163
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:32,590
links are all there. Uh, 175. I assume you've got what? Credit card?

1164
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,600
All that fun stuff. Yes.

1165
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:34,790
Can you use

1166
00:54:34,949 --> 00:54:36,000
-- Bitcoin
-- paypal? And

1167
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:39,590
we can use Bitcoin and not only can you use Bitcoin but

1168
00:54:39,719 --> 00:54:43,790
-- you get a bonus. If you use Bitcoin a bonus,
-- I already bought my ticket.

1169
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,600
Maybe I should buy another one.

1170
00:54:45,229 --> 00:54:45,689
Uh,

1171
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:47,169
what's,

1172
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:50,169
what's the bonus? Let me know. I'll know if I should buy two tickets.

1173
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:55,080
-- I, I can't disclose the bonus.
-- See, now, that's even worse. Now I'm gonna be like,

1174
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,679
what is it? Should I buy a ticket?

1175
00:54:56,929 --> 00:54:58,020
We'll see. All right. Anyway,

1176
00:54:58,169 --> 00:54:58,840
well,

1177
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,600
you can earn the bonus at the,

1178
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:05,639
uh, at the conference, but by paying Bitcoin, I feel you already earned it.

1179
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:08,959
Yeah. And, and so you see, that's the lazy way out, right?

1180
00:55:08,969 --> 00:55:12,870
I just pay with Bitcoin and then I don't have to do any real work at the conference.

1181
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:14,100
Have

1182
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:16,459
-- gone through ransomware. I guess they'll know what to do.
-- That's

1183
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:17,189
true. It's just, yeah.

1184
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:19,350
Right. It's just like ransomware.

1185
00:55:20,199 --> 00:55:24,750
Awesome. All right, Michael. Thank you so much. It has been an absolute pleasure.

1186
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:27,429
Uh Good luck with the show. I will see you there

1187
00:55:28,139 --> 00:55:30,439
and, and folks out there buy your tickets

1188
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:34,000
and hopefully we'll see you all there as well. So, all right, thanks guys.

1189
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:34,969
Have a, have a great one.

1190
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:37,290
Bye.
