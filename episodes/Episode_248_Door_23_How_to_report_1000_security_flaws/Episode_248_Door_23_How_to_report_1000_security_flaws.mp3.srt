00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:03,319
So, Josh, I found 1000 security flaws in your product.

1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,110
What day is it? I have no idea.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,399
-- That's the day after yesterday.
-- It's, it's December 23rd.

3
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:10,439
We have to tell people because maybe people don't know.

4
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:14,279
-- Or you could be like, oh, it's door 20 three.
-- Wouldn't the episodes be labeled?

5
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:17,239
-- It's
-- labeled whatever. We don't know. We don't know.

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,559
Maybe future historians have found this and they're like,

7
00:00:19,569 --> 00:00:21,010
we have no idea what's going on.

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:21,559
Oh, a different.

9
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,360
-- That's fair.
-- Right. Maybe aliens have, like, conquered humanity finally.

10
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:25,799
You know,

11
00:00:26,069 --> 00:00:31,139
-- we were their example at
-- this point. I don't think it can get any worse.

12
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:34,639
I welcome my alien overloads anyway. Anyway. All right. What's the topic?

13
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,360
So, the topic is how to report, let's say, for the sake of argument.

14
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:39,549
1000 security flaws.

15
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:42,330
Good luck.

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,180
Yeah. I mean,

17
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:45,650
the reality is

18
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:50,240
number one, you would, obviously this would be generated by an automated system

19
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,869
probably because

20
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,069
each security flaw is going to take at least a few minutes by a human being.

21
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,419
And so that's weeks of work.

22
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,720
-- All right,
-- you can't look, I'm gonna,

23
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:03,080
I'm gonna say I've, I've talked to more than one person about this top,

24
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,638
like on more than one occasion.

25
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,860
-- And I will tell you now that if you're reporting 1000
-- do most projects will shoot

26
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:14,089
you in the face if you file 1000 bugs like or just create 1000 bucks,

27
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:15,930
regardless of what they are.

28
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:20,089
The point is when you find something this bad, you have to take

29
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,260
a, a heartbleed style disclosure policy where you just

30
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,919
say this is what I found and then

31
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,779
the community can get involved,

32
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,500
individual projects can get involved because the reality is if

33
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,839
you go to a special open source project and say,

34
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:37,639
oh here's a bug, it's going, it's not going to be taken.

35
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,330
Well by most projects, you actually need to show up with a patch in many instances.

36
00:01:41,349 --> 00:01:43,660
And so just like crapping stuff into their

37
00:01:43,669 --> 00:01:46,360
bug tracker and running away is not appreciated

38
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:49,839
and you're going to end up the bad guy even if you had good intentions.

39
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:50,120
Yeah,

40
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,000
I would say probably the best thing to do is

41
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,610
to make available the automated system that found these bugs,

42
00:01:56,194 --> 00:01:58,535
which for example, Google did with their fuzzing,

43
00:01:58,775 --> 00:02:02,735
right? Because fuzzing is infamous for this. I found a gazillion crash cases.

44
00:02:02,745 --> 00:02:06,495
And more to the point, I'm not sure if it's one function or 100 functions ultimately,

45
00:02:06,504 --> 00:02:07,595
you know, until we collapse it.

46
00:02:07,605 --> 00:02:11,595
I remember this with the biggest example I remember is

47
00:02:11,604 --> 00:02:14,895
the free type font processing libraries in open source.

48
00:02:14,904 --> 00:02:16,375
Would they were notorious for,

49
00:02:16,384 --> 00:02:20,425
like a fuzz would find it looked like hundreds of bugs and then, oh, no, just one.

50
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:20,854
Yeah.

51
00:02:21,065 --> 00:02:25,770
And I agree. I think, think it is irresponsible to

52
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,669
say, have a fuzz or some other automated system

53
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,559
-- and claim you found something but then not show anyone what you did like
-- that is,

54
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,789
well, not allow them to reproduce it.

55
00:02:35,809 --> 00:02:37,949
-- Yeah.
-- Exactly. That's, it's ridiculous.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,949
And this is fundamentally, this is, I mean,

57
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,500
there's a reason the scientific method talks about reproducibility a lot.

58
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:43,589
Yeah.

59
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:44,100
Right.

60
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,250
We also need this in security because not only do I need to reproduce

61
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:49,199
it so I can then figure out what happened and try and fix it.

62
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,705
But I kind of also to know that I actually fixed

63
00:02:51,824 --> 00:02:53,235
-- it.
-- That's, yeah, that's a very good

64
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:55,705
remember, I was going to say specific,

65
00:02:55,714 --> 00:02:58,934
well say shelf but there's actually dozens where, oh, we fixed it.

66
00:02:58,985 --> 00:03:00,294
No, you didn't.

67
00:03:00,304 --> 00:03:04,085
You fixed a specific avenue of it or vendors that, you know,

68
00:03:04,095 --> 00:03:07,955
fix a web bug by putting a single filter expression.

69
00:03:08,134 --> 00:03:11,824
Right. That one field. Oh, wait, all the other fields are also vulnerable.

70
00:03:11,835 --> 00:03:12,324
We'll just,

71
00:03:12,335 --> 00:03:15,024
we'll keep whacking those moles because shell shock

72
00:03:15,035 --> 00:03:17,455
ended up being four or was it six CV

73
00:03:17,934 --> 00:03:20,259
S? Because we played the whack a mole? It was a nightmare.

74
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,179
-- It was a
-- lot

75
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,440
and it was very painful and unnecessarily painful.

76
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:28,410
-- But
-- now at the same time, this is a great example of a researcher basically

77
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,210
dumped the information to the world and the world came together and

78
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,820
worked on it instead of saying I'm just going to file a bug

79
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:42,000
-- in every application in every distribution and everything
-- to be fair. Yeah,

80
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:44,250
the shell shock problem wasn't with the bug reporter.

81
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:48,955
-- It was with the proposal solutions.
-- Yeah, it was upstream s fault. I blame upstream.

82
00:03:48,964 --> 00:03:52,365
So that actually this is a bad example but also a good example.

83
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,285
It's a reasonable example.

84
00:03:54,294 --> 00:03:54,975
I think, I mean,

85
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,774
there have been instances where now this is just one of

86
00:03:57,785 --> 00:04:00,195
those problems that I don't think it happens very often.

87
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:02,964
It's a Black Swan event and there's no way to do it.

88
00:04:03,085 --> 00:04:05,175
It's the problem of the law of large numbers

89
00:04:05,434 --> 00:04:08,035
and the problem with the law of large numbers is every problem with

90
00:04:08,044 --> 00:04:11,615
the law of large numbers becomes a logistics and strategy and policy problem.

91
00:04:11,675 --> 00:04:12,875
It's no longer dinner.

92
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:16,678
It's how do we keep everybody from starving when you have to feed 10 million people?

93
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,649
-- Yeah,
-- it's, it's a very different problem for sure. And again, I think this is where

94
00:04:20,809 --> 00:04:23,869
one person cannot solve this, but

95
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:25,880
the human race can.

96
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,579
And if you don't tell people all of the gory details,

97
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:32,480
they can't work together to solve this problem.

98
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:33,049
-- I
-- agree.

99
00:04:33,059 --> 00:04:34,049
That seems very,

100
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,660
very hippy dippy, doesn't it?

101
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,170
Well, the reality is statistically speaking,

102
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,309
two people will beat one person every single time.

103
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,059
And generally speaking, if you especially want some sort of 24 7 capability.

104
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,309
You can't do that with one person. You need teams

105
00:04:47,429 --> 00:04:50,450
and, and most importantly is if you

106
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:54,720
create a community around your, your security issue

107
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,700
and you bring everyone together,

108
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,059
you are the hero.

109
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:01,299
If you show up, poke them with a stick and run away,

110
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:02,579
you're the villain.

111
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:02,940
Yeah.

112
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,619
And I think that's the difficulty is I think a lot of people think, oh,

113
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,260
I'm going to report all these bugs

114
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:12,119
and they don't realize that you're actually the bad guy in this story.

115
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:17,950
How often do people show up thinking? I did one thing. I will be lauded as a victor.

116
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:19,839
No, it's, there's a lot more to it.

117
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,200
Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. That, all right.

118
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:23,880
See you tomorrow.

119
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,839
Thanks everybody.
