Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 139

1
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,000
with myself Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime,

2
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:12,729
Josh Pressers.

3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:13,720
Kurt,

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,809
uh, just watching the Brexit train wreck and trying to, at this point,

5
00:00:17,819 --> 00:00:19,579
I'm not even trying to understand what the outcome is.

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,639
I'm trying to understand what it is. Like what it,

7
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:28,090
-- it makes no sense. None of it. It makes
-- perfect sense if you look at it in the right way

8
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:34,119
and I'll recap for the listeners. What I explained to you prior to hitting record is

9
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:39,439
basically they were told, pick a number 12 or three and they said I pick four

10
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:42,810
and then someone else said, no, you can't pick four. You have to pick 12 or three.

11
00:00:42,819 --> 00:00:46,150
And they said, no, no, you don't understand. I picked four and that's pretty much it.

12
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,340
And that's all of the discussions that have been happening since then is one

13
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:52,209
group saying you have to pick 12 or three and the other people saying,

14
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,790
but I picked four and that's pretty much it,

15
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:57,569
I guess. Yeah, that actually summarizes it nicely.

16
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:00,540
It makes me sad that,

17
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:03,360
that is 100% accurate when describing the

18
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:05,919
conversations that have been happening around Brexit.

19
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,870
And now the one interesting thing and I don't,

20
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:13,199
this podcast might come out after the, what is it? March 29th date?

21
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,779
Deadline?

22
00:01:14,989 --> 00:01:15,519
-- Right.
-- Right.

23
00:01:15,529 --> 00:01:19,930
-- If it, if it does,
-- I'm not see, I'm not even clear what that deadline is for.

24
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:21,629
That's when like they're out. Right.

25
00:01:21,639 --> 00:01:23,139
And if they don't do anything, well,

26
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,139
unless they extend it and apparently the eu has said we're not going to

27
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,099
allow you to extend it unless there's some material benefit to that extension.

28
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,139
Right.

29
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:35,099
And, and, but anyway, at this point, when I looked at the betting markets,

30
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,529
the betting markets all think

31
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:40,970
the UK is going to leave the EU with no deal. And

32
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:44,709
so a hard Brexit and for what it's worth, I know that's sort of voodoo,

33
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,220
but the betting markets get this stuff.

34
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:50,129
-- Right. A lot.
-- Well, markets do

35
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,720
you know the wisdom of markets? It's not always 100% but

36
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,330
it's definitely better than

37
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,510
probably what's on CNN or, you know, the BBC,

38
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:00,269
almost certainly. Right.

39
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:04,190
Because most of these people, like, if, if you're running a betting organization,

40
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:05,389
they have skin in the game,

41
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:05,879
right?

42
00:02:05,889 --> 00:02:07,500
You have to do real research because you're

43
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,669
actually going to lose money if you're wrong.

44
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:11,860
Yeah. So, anyway, let's move on to,

45
00:02:12,089 --> 00:02:14,210
I guess, more depressing topics.

46
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:15,580
All right.

47
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:19,570
Well, speaking of which another, well, we're just gonna cover this quickly.

48
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,149
Uh, voting, the Swiss came out with an electronic voting

49
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:28,880
system thing that they then, uh, allowed the public to take a poke cut

50
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,619
for security testing

51
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,539
and guess what job?

52
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:32,619
Which is cool.

53
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,009
But guess what happened

54
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:36,529
exactly what we would expect to happen.

55
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:40,809
Yeah, they found flaws and they found backdoors and

56
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,850
the whole thing is just a flaming turd. Basically.

57
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,490
I'm, I'm shocked that that was the case,

58
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:49,899
-- possibly predicted.
-- Well, here's what's even worse. It's a flaming Turd.

59
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,289
But by, by honest honestly, by,

60
00:02:52,649 --> 00:02:55,190
by software standards for voting software,

61
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:58,000
it's actually probably one of the best things out there,

62
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:01,009
you know, and people found flaws in it and they found a back door in it

63
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,669
and in related news,

64
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:06,110
DARPA is building a $10 million open source secure voting system.

65
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,789
Now, I like that. They say it's a secure voting system,

66
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,070
right? Because I mean, II, I think that was the problem, right?

67
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,029
The Swiss built a voting system. They didn't build a secure voting system,

68
00:03:16,809 --> 00:03:17,070
right?

69
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,720
They should have just named it Secure Voting and

70
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:21,229
then I'm sure everything would have been fine.

71
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,949
So I think DARPA got it here. Like

72
00:03:24,179 --> 00:03:25,460
it's a secure voting system.

73
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,589
-- So I think we're good.
-- I,

74
00:03:28,339 --> 00:03:31,589
-- you think 10 million is enough? I don't think so. I think they need a few more
-- zeros.

75
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,570
I think 10 million is actually too much because they're gonna,

76
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,039
the fact that you're paying people to build this, you're,

77
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,690
you're not going to get the best and brightest who care deeply about this.

78
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:43,809
Maybe more to the

79
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,740
point, maybe,

80
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:45,589
you know,

81
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,429
building we've talked about this before but building a voting system that is,

82
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,910
has properties of being secret and being verifiable and being accessible.

83
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,059
Because what about blind people?

84
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:01,809
-- That's, that's a very, very complex problem
-- actually, it's not.

85
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:06,710
And I will take the 10 million and I will give you a ream of paper in the box.

86
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,429
Elections. Canada figured that one out. Thank goodness.

87
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,089
Yeah, I, I love elections, Canada for that.

88
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:17,630
It's you, you make your X in the circle and sorry, not an, is it an X or a check mark?

89
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,010
No, it's an X. Not a checkmark and that's it.

90
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:22,529
And you fold it and you shove it in the box and yes.

91
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,049
And they,

92
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,769
and, and if you accidentally make a check mark, I bet you're ok.

93
00:04:27,119 --> 00:04:28,850
No, you have to go get a fresh paper.

94
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,570
Oh, really? They like they will not accept a check mark. You have to write an X.

95
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,299
Yeah. Yeah,

96
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:38,850
-- fair
-- enough. And part of me was always thinking, you know, honestly, if you can't

97
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:44,410
meet that barrier of entry, then maybe you shouldn't vote. But on the flip side.

98
00:04:45,739 --> 00:04:47,179
Yeah, I don't know. I

99
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:47,959
Yeah.

100
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:49,489
Yeah.

101
00:04:49,869 --> 00:04:50,079
So

102
00:04:50,309 --> 00:04:53,369
my, my whole take on electronic voting is number one. It's,

103
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,489
I'm not sure what problem it solves.

104
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:59,059
Like really, I'm not sure what problem it solves.

105
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,179
Number two, it's horrendously complex. And complicated to do.

106
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,089
And number three, every single one of these systems,

107
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,989
even the good ones is a flaming turd of security flaws

108
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,709
or backdoors or God.

109
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:10,670
Um

110
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:13,950
And pretty much doomed to failure.

111
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:18,070
So that's that. Ok. So we're done with e voting. Thank goodness,

112
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:18,950
great

113
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,070
from

114
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:20,910
-- so
-- yeah.

115
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,390
So now we actually have some interesting stuff.

116
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:25,350
So

117
00:05:25,489 --> 00:05:26,429
browsers

118
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,279
have actually been doing some cool stuff this week,

119
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,209
which is awesome. Yeah.

120
00:05:31,369 --> 00:05:32,230
So I think uh well,

121
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:34,070
let's lead with and I love that this is still

122
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,339
a problem because it's just still such a problem.

123
00:05:36,739 --> 00:05:38,420
Ok, Josh, I got a one gigabyte file.

124
00:05:38,429 --> 00:05:42,299
I want to send you and I sent it to your email and it didn't work.

125
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:44,920
Uh it, it would work because we both use Gmail. It's fine,

126
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:46,209
right?

127
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,140
So it's still shockingly difficult to send somebody a

128
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:51,309
file over the size of a few megabytes.

129
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:58,329
-- Yep. Yep.
-- And so Mozilla has this cool new thing called Mozilla Send

130
00:05:58,459 --> 00:05:59,179
and it's

131
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,290
sorry, Firefox. And,

132
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,739
-- and uh it allows you to send a file to somebody,
-- right?

133
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,899
And it looks like it's one gigabyte kind of anonymously

134
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,609
or you can have an account and do 2.5 gigs,

135
00:06:11,619 --> 00:06:13,429
which is, that's a pretty big file.

136
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,899
And what's even cooler is you can do things like it.

137
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,779
The file expires after one download,

138
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,579
which is quite often what most of what us want.

139
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,109
You know, I want you to download

140
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:25,649
goes away and you can share it with specific people, you can encrypt it.

141
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,519
My assumption is that this is piggybacking on the work

142
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:31,750
they've done around encryption and storage of the user profiles.

143
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:33,709
Because Firefox does some really,

144
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,470
they built some really cool technology

145
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:38,890
around encrypting and storing your Firefox profile

146
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:39,769
so that

147
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,329
you can log into your Firefox web browser.

148
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:45,809
And it goes to Firefox gets your profile data decrypt it and

149
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,320
you have all your bookmarks and your

150
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,670
stuff, extensions, whatever

151
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:51,089
it

152
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,559
is magic and works.

153
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:56,880
Yeah, this is uh and this is free and it, it appears to be quite simple,

154
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:00,140
-- which I like.
-- No, I agree. I think it's super awesome

155
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:02,640
because honestly, this is one of those real world problems that

156
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,619
we still either we have to agree on.

157
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,779
Ok, we're going to use Google Drive or we're going to use Dropbox.

158
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,119
We're gonna use box.com or

159
00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:11,239
I'm going to physically mail you something

160
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,089
and all these things take time.

161
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,410
I have to set up an account and you know, what are the options? And blah, blah, blah.

162
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,709
And I literally just want to send you the file.

163
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:21,019
Yeah, I'm, I'm very familiar with this problem.

164
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:21,369
And in fact,

165
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,929
we have this all the time where if we

166
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,450
need to transfer like audio files between each other,

167
00:07:25,859 --> 00:07:30,529
it would we use usually Google Drive and it was kind of a pain in the neck because

168
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:34,190
if you don't have the fancy infinite amount corporate accounts,

169
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,950
-- what's that?
-- It was a huge pain.

170
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:37,399
Yeah.

171
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:37,720
Yeah.

172
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,359
We're both

173
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,309
Google users.

174
00:07:40,429 --> 00:07:43,239
Uh Yeah. Yeah. It, it was not fun.

175
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,170
So I'm, I'm glad

176
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:48,149
they've done this and this I feel like is

177
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:52,399
Firefox is in a unique position as a

178
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:56,970
web browser because they're essentially 100% consumer focused,

179
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,299
right?

180
00:07:57,309 --> 00:08:00,420
You look at say Google or Microsoft or Apple or

181
00:08:00,429 --> 00:08:03,670
other things and it's kind of part of a bigger ecosystem

182
00:08:03,829 --> 00:08:08,609
and I think something like sharing files is unexciting and there's

183
00:08:08,619 --> 00:08:12,649
basically no way you're going to use that to generate revenue.

184
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:17,239
And so I have a suspicion that's part of the reason it's just never been solved.

185
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,040
Well, it's been solved, but it's Balkanized, right?

186
00:08:20,049 --> 00:08:22,269
You have box, you have Dropbox, you have Spider

187
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,089
Oak, you have

188
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,709
Google, you have icloud, you have blah, blah, blah and,

189
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,320
and within each of these, you know, like with an icloud, I have,

190
00:08:29,329 --> 00:08:32,590
I can set up family photo albums and share them to other icloud accounts.

191
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:32,859
But

192
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:36,758
I don't think I can just share them to random people unless I make them public. And

193
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:40,179
so, you know, and, and this is why every time somebody's like,

194
00:08:40,188 --> 00:08:42,999
why do people post their photos to Facebook where anybody can see them?

195
00:08:43,008 --> 00:08:45,968
And the answer is because it's basically impossible to share them with your family.

196
00:08:45,979 --> 00:08:46,838
Otherwise,

197
00:08:47,489 --> 00:08:50,379
do you remember trying to share photos before Facebook?

198
00:08:50,888 --> 00:08:51,908
That was the solution.

199
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:53,258
-- It
-- was impossible.

200
00:08:53,338 --> 00:08:55,039
Yeah. No, the solution was, I didn't share them.

201
00:08:55,049 --> 00:09:01,588
I remember when my kids were born, we set up a, I set up gallery on a private server

202
00:09:01,969 --> 00:09:04,090
and it was, ah, it sucked so hard

203
00:09:04,219 --> 00:09:07,830
-- to keep that thing updated in gallery,
-- like gallery. Is that PHP?

204
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,229
Photo album software? Right.

205
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,229
Yeah. And there was, like, always remote

206
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,909
remote code execution flaws in it. And I was updating it constantly.

207
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:18,229
And I remember at one point like this obviously had nothing to do with work.

208
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:21,229
And I was like, can I please just help you guys with your security stuff?

209
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:25,349
Let me give you AC be ID, then I'll write your emails because

210
00:09:26,109 --> 00:09:28,380
I'm tired of finding out about this in the wrong way.

211
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,469
Yeah, there's

212
00:09:30,289 --> 00:09:30,979
a, there's a lot of CV

213
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,890
S for gallery,

214
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:36,840
-- like a lot.
-- It was, but it's PHP. Right. It was very hard to write PHP code.

215
00:09:36,849 --> 00:09:37,770
That wasn't terrible.

216
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,780
And thank goodness, no, doesn't have this problem, you know.

217
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,750
No, doesn't have CV S.

218
00:09:44,109 --> 00:09:45,169
That's true.

219
00:09:45,349 --> 00:09:49,260
It's true. They don't have CV E so they got that going for them.

220
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:54,000
Yeah. No, this is good. This is because I think part of the problem is, you know,

221
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:56,309
I want this stuff to be so simple that my,

222
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,760
my parents and my kids can use it without having to think about it.

223
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:04,650
-- Yeah,
-- I agree. I agree. And, and this is, this is sort of one of those things I hope

224
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:06,130
and

225
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,059
I mean, this is,

226
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:10,619
I think this is something for the security industry to pay attention to is how

227
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,840
can we make tools that make people's lives easier and not make them much,

228
00:10:14,849 --> 00:10:15,469
much worse.

229
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,799
And we, to date, I don't think have very many tools that do that.

230
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:20,859
I think part of the problem too is these tools have

231
00:10:20,869 --> 00:10:22,679
to be built in and part of the operating system.

232
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,239
Like think about the difference between

233
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:27,960
a command prompt on Windows and a command prompt on any

234
00:10:28,289 --> 00:10:29,179
Linux UNIX

235
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:30,599
Mac Os system.

236
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,070
And there's a huge night and day and Windows

237
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,190
is just finally catching up with powershell and bash.

238
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:39,130
But it's, you know, for 20 years, I was installing

239
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:42,890
sin and doing all sorts of hor horrendously complicated

240
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,929
things to replicate a UNIX tool chain on windows.

241
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,640
And then I finally just gave up and bought Macs.

242
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,890
And as much as I'm annoyed by Mac,

243
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,729
you open up a terminal

244
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,440
and you have a command shell that actually,

245
00:10:55,609 --> 00:10:57,400
yeah, it may not be new said, but

246
00:10:57,729 --> 00:11:00,059
you know, at least the set is reasonably

247
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,190
san

248
00:11:01,469 --> 00:11:03,390
right? It it exists

249
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:07,919
-- and with brew, thank God for
-- brew. It's a low bar. But

250
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:12,849
yeah, why they shipped a knot Gnu set is beyond me. But whatever,

251
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,739
because those lines

252
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,190
because

253
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:15,520
it's Apple

254
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:17,929
and shut up, they know better, right?

255
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:23,010
That's except line returns work differently between the two and it's just anyways.

256
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,650
So,

257
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:25,679
so I think part of it is this stuff has to be built

258
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,390
like if you build something into the web browser now everybody has it.

259
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,650
Whereas if you require even an extension,

260
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:32,919
maybe 1% of people have it.

261
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,849
Right. And that's part of the thing is,

262
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:39,849
you know, well, like your story with, you know, trying to get printer drivers. Like

263
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:40,530
the other, I,

264
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:42,309
I finally broke down and bought a Windows 10

265
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,840
machine to run steam and games for my kids.

266
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:45,989
And

267
00:11:46,669 --> 00:11:51,130
I know to type in like gigabyte driver, you know, what is it?

268
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:56,849
Uh B 450 MD S3 H whatever the heck the motherboard number is.

269
00:11:57,179 --> 00:11:59,260
And I know to make sure I'm at gigabyte.com

270
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,500
before I click that link to download these,

271
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,650
you know, zip files.

272
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:04,570
And then I open these zip files and I'm like,

273
00:12:05,489 --> 00:12:09,070
ok, two of them have a setup dot exe. Ok, double click and hope for the best.

274
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,669
And then the third one, I open it up and I'm like, there's, there's no setup dot exe.

275
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:15,969
Do I have to like go into the device manager and dip around with this or?

276
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,590
Ok. Open up. There's a zip file in the zip file. Open that up. There's a setup dot exc.

277
00:12:19,599 --> 00:12:21,380
Ok. Double click that and hope for the best.

278
00:12:21,849 --> 00:12:23,409
And it, it actually runs and it's like,

279
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:25,900
do you want to install this like version 18 of these A MD drivers

280
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:28,119
or do you want to download and install version 19 of these drivers?

281
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:28,690
And I'm like,

282
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,510
I probably want the newest ones, right?

283
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:33,760
So I,

284
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,640
I chose that and then I install all these

285
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,599
drivers and reboot it and the machine still works.

286
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:41,700
There's no errors in the device manager. So I'm like done. I, that's it.

287
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,359
Like

288
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:45,940
if any of these drivers auto update, then that happens. But otherwise,

289
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:50,679
unless like the screen starts, you know, half the screen is pink and flashing.

290
00:12:50,849 --> 00:12:52,479
I'm never touching these drivers again.

291
00:12:52,619 --> 00:12:56,640
Like, and I'm a techie, I, you know, and, and I'm afraid of this breaking this thing.

292
00:12:56,729 --> 00:12:58,940
So I, I'm really beginning to understand where people are like, oh,

293
00:12:58,950 --> 00:12:59,840
you want to share this file?

294
00:12:59,849 --> 00:13:00,229
Simple,

295
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:01,940
just download this extension and create an account over

296
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,619
here and sign up for this and blah,

297
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,159
blah, blah.

298
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:06,159
It's like, no, that's not gonna happen. Right.

299
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:07,419
Yeah.

300
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:10,099
-- Yeah, I hear you, man.
-- It's the best part is

301
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,200
this machine

302
00:13:11,729 --> 00:13:15,039
with an HDM I cable. You can access the bios and you can see windows boot,

303
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,380
but then the screen disappears.

304
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:20,429
So I had to buy ad V I cable to plug the monitor and buy ad V I.

305
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,900
So I can actually log into windows and finish the setup

306
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:26,950
-- and I still haven't.
-- Windows wouldn't work over HDM. I by default.

307
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,390
No,

308
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,690
I saw the little Circle Booth thing and then it disappeared.

309
00:13:30,859 --> 00:13:34,489
And so I think, I think now that I've installed all the drivers, I think it will work,

310
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,849
but I haven't actually tried it yet

311
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,450
and I might just have to live with the DV cable. And again,

312
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:39,109
I'm,

313
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,380
I'm done. I don't care. I just, whatever

314
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,140
I give up.

315
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:44,500
Right. Right.

316
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:47,460
I'm just gonna pick whichever cable works and I'm not gonna fight with it.

317
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:54,530
-- This is computers. I love it. It's always broken,
-- dude. I have an M CS C and NT four.

318
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:56,770
Like, I, I've been doing this for 20 years

319
00:13:56,909 --> 00:13:57,890
and I still,

320
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,020
you know what I mean?

321
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:02,429
Like, if, and if I plug that DV, I cable in and I hadn't got a screen,

322
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:06,580
-- I don't know what I would have actually done to make it work.
-- Go find a VG. A cable man.

323
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:06,809
Motherboard

324
00:14:07,109 --> 00:14:07,450
doesn't have,

325
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,650
I guess I would have bought, I would have,

326
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:11,940
I was seriously like looking online for an

327
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,880
old enough video card that has native windows,

328
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:14,739
10 drivers,

329
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,460
I guess, would be the next stage, right?

330
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:19,109
-- Of grief and bargain.
-- I, I,

331
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,159
I don't even know what,

332
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:24,260
what to do and I'm not even going to think about it because I don't want to,

333
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:24,960
it's working.

334
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:25,390
It's,

335
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,409
it's, it,

336
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,099
-- I'm gonna glue those connectors
-- on.

337
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:31,460
-- Never touch it again and everything so
-- much.

338
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:35,630
Anyway, anyway, that, that's enough windows talk for a while.

339
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:37,919
So, what else is new?

340
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:43,559
-- So
-- also in browser news, apparently. Uh So alphabet is the parent company of Google.

341
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,739
And one thing I'm not clear on,

342
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,340
are they naming all the companies in alphabetical order?

343
00:14:46,369 --> 00:14:49,409
Because there's this new one called Jigsaw is launching a chrome?

344
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:50,799
-- I don't know.
-- Are they

345
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,260
-- that would be interesting if
-- they were something Google or alphabet would do

346
00:14:54,369 --> 00:14:54,770
anyway.

347
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:58,070
So Jigsaw is launching a chrome extension designed

348
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,039
to help moderate toxic comments on social media,

349
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:00,349
which

350
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,559
I mean, I, I like that because we've had um shadow banning, you know, via,

351
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,979
on forums and stuff.

352
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,559
Well, some forums for a long time,

353
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,840
um but it would be nice to kind of bring it

354
00:15:09,849 --> 00:15:12,559
to the browser and it's funny because they're talking about A I

355
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,609
to, you know, filter these toxic comments.

356
00:15:14,619 --> 00:15:17,419
And I'm I'm honestly thinking most of these toxic comments there just like

357
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,119
a couple 100 keywords,

358
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:20,590
you know, if you see more than two

359
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:20,729
of

360
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:21,159
them,

361
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:27,559
-- but chances are it's a toxic comment.
-- So I, I think about this one so much. So

362
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:30,080
I approve

363
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,200
of the, the idea behind this.

364
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:36,239
But the thing that always concerns me is like especially in the

365
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,010
case of Google or in the case of nearly any group,

366
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:43,580
do you trust them to decide what is or isn't a toxic comment?

367
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,359
Like are they going to decide that

368
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,109
people saying bad things about Google

369
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,580
-- is a toxic comment?
-- Yeah. And I mean, OK, so 100%

370
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:55,260
mistakes will be made intentionally or otherwise

371
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:56,599
unquestionably

372
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,390
part of the challenge is

373
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:02,539
we're now like ad filtering is typically I don't want to say easy,

374
00:16:02,549 --> 00:16:04,260
but ad filtering is somewhat simple.

375
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:08,830
In the fact of you're blocking domains, you're blocking certain known elements,

376
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:10,700
you're blocking, you know, sort of

377
00:16:10,909 --> 00:16:12,250
images of a certain,

378
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:14,169
you know, size and properties

379
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:16,130
but blocking comments.

380
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:19,559
Like if I'm looking at a thread of 100 comments, am I are any being blocked?

381
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,609
Like will it give you a hint?

382
00:16:21,619 --> 00:16:24,979
Like will it show you a blank space saying like like a little overlay saying,

383
00:16:24,989 --> 00:16:27,119
you know, there's a toxic comment, click here to see it

384
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:31,039
or does it just sort of silently disappeared into the cornfield?

385
00:16:31,219 --> 00:16:34,159
-- Yeah,
-- I don't, I don't know what the answer to that is going to be and,

386
00:16:34,169 --> 00:16:38,280
and even ignoring that, let's say it does tell you something's blocked

387
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,400
what

388
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:42,219
it, it's, I just keep feeling like

389
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:48,690
there is merit in trying to stop terrible people from saying terrible things.

390
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:51,340
But the issue always becomes what I think

391
00:16:51,349 --> 00:16:53,380
is a terrible person saying a terrible thing.

392
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,460
Another person might not agree with

393
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,340
-- that
-- who decides

394
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,739
well, and the reality is,

395
00:16:58,974 --> 00:17:00,344
how do I put this nicely?

396
00:17:00,505 --> 00:17:04,814
-- All speech at some point will be offensive to at least one person.
-- Right.

397
00:17:04,944 --> 00:17:08,094
I'm sure this podcast has offended more than one person.

398
00:17:08,104 --> 00:17:11,935
And luckily we live in countries where we can say nearly anything

399
00:17:11,944 --> 00:17:14,574
we want and not worry about getting in trouble for it.

400
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:14,895
But,

401
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:17,459
I mean, we've talked before about the fact that, like,

402
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,348
I'm not going to Russia. Right.

403
00:17:19,358 --> 00:17:19,579
Just,

404
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:22,729
we've said enough crap about Russia on this podcast that there is no

405
00:17:22,739 --> 00:17:25,010
way I'm going to even try to go to that country now.

406
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,510
Right. No, no. Russia's on my not to do list.

407
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:30,089
-- Right.
-- Right. Exactly.

408
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,010
And, and in fact I was talking about this with a friend the other night.

409
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,359
He was, he's ex-military and after,

410
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,260
you know, just all the leaks that have been happening lately, he's like,

411
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:42,650
I can't even imagine traveling to some of these countries now just because,

412
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,459
you know, being ex-military you're unquestionably on a list.

413
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:48,579
And, and, I mean, that's, that's one of the things that always gets me here.

414
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:50,430
And the thing that I keep coming back to is

415
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:55,280
who is in charge of telling people what is and isn't acceptable comments.

416
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:55,680
And I will tell

417
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:56,310
you now,

418
00:17:56,849 --> 00:18:01,229
I do not trust Google as far as I can throw them because they have

419
00:18:01,239 --> 00:18:05,469
proven time and time again that they put their self interest above everything else.

420
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:08,969
Well, but that's what people in organizations have to do otherwise they wouldn't

421
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:09,760
exist.

422
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:13,349
And part of the problem too is it's not even so much who is deciding what it's?

423
00:18:13,369 --> 00:18:16,069
Is there any transparency? Number one

424
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:20,229
and number two, is there any process to deal with the false positives or the messes?

425
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:25,189
And it could be, you know, an appeals process or it could be something as simple as,

426
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,459
um like with, you know, the ad filters,

427
00:18:27,469 --> 00:18:29,709
they have various lists that they subscribe to and you can

428
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:31,770
choose which ones you do and do not subscribe to,

429
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,089
subscribe to all of them.

430
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:37,530
I mean, but I, you know, I, I'm starting now that I, I, and again,

431
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,810
not to talk about windows too much, but now that I have a Windows machine,

432
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:42,060
I need to start looking at some parental control software

433
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,020
and this is the same problem here.

434
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:50,540
You know, I for example, think that it's ok if my kids want to look up breast cancer,

435
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,280
I'm ok with that.

436
00:18:53,589 --> 00:18:54,829
You know, um,

437
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,430
there are other,

438
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,449
-- well, there's software that will block that because
-- breasts,

439
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,949
uh, my kids found that they were talking about their,

440
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:04,829
their schools have filtering software and it was

441
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,030
II,

442
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,979
I feel like it might have been breast cancer that they were talking about.

443
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:11,949
And obviously, yeah, they,

444
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:14,709
they couldn't look up anything on Wikipedia about that topic,

445
00:19:15,199 --> 00:19:19,439
-- which is, which is wild. But
-- on the flip side having glanced at for

446
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:21,550
Chan and other sites,

447
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:24,140
yeah,

448
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:26,180
that's all I have to say about that.

449
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,560
And I get why they exist.

450
00:19:27,569 --> 00:19:29,579
And I definitely, you know, you,

451
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:32,459
and I'm guessing you as well were on B BS S before the internet.

452
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,819
Uh, for those of you

453
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:33,959
who

454
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:34,719
don't know,

455
00:19:34,729 --> 00:19:38,699
that's a bulletin board system and you would dial in with your phone modem

456
00:19:39,459 --> 00:19:42,920
and then it was a computer that you could leave messages on

457
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,579
or read messages on or play what were called door games.

458
00:19:45,589 --> 00:19:47,900
So they were like little text based games.

459
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:49,839
Um, and I used to

460
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:53,239
use a feature in one of those games horrendously

461
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,680
to win it every time because the game would

462
00:19:54,689 --> 00:19:58,050
run for about two weeks and I would win every time I was a bit of a,

463
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,520
not a good person that way.

464
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:00,050
There

465
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:00,329
you go.

466
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,280
But, um,

467
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:03,459
there you go. Yeah. So,

468
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:04,489
yeah, I don't know. I,

469
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:08,699
this, and this is something where I think is going to become even more of a

470
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:12,089
concern because I'm thinking about augmented reality.

471
00:20:12,099 --> 00:20:14,900
And one thing I really would love to have for augmented reality.

472
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:15,959
My, my two biggest,

473
00:20:15,969 --> 00:20:18,099
my personal use cases are I want to look at you

474
00:20:18,109 --> 00:20:20,619
and know who you are because I'm terrible at remembering names,

475
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,689
you know, and a little bit of context, like, do I owe you money?

476
00:20:23,699 --> 00:20:24,780
Do I owe you a drink?

477
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,550
Whatever? Right.

478
00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:31,459
And number two, I would like to sort of filter out ads like

479
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,579
I was reading the other day, Hawaii

480
00:20:33,689 --> 00:20:35,079
doesn't allow billboards,

481
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:38,319
which is cool. That sounds amazing

482
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:42,359
because I live in a town where we have a lot of really ugly advertising,

483
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,579
like just physically

484
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,010
ugly every

485
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:45,290
everywhere.

486
00:20:45,729 --> 00:20:46,359
And

487
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,099
I would be quite happy to get an extension

488
00:20:49,109 --> 00:20:52,160
that overlays exhibits from the moma or the Louver

489
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,130
-- over those.
-- That would be awesome.

490
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:00,829
That would be so cool until of course, then you'll have companies saying, oh,

491
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:04,689
you can't, you can't come in my store because you have your ad blocker on your

492
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,150
A R headset.

493
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:07,750
So,

494
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,160
yeah, I think those two big things are, is that that transparency of, you know,

495
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,359
what decisions are being made, how are they being made

496
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:16,150
and then having some process to deal with whoopsies?

497
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:18,660
That isn't completely insane.

498
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,459
You know, like D MC A takedown systems that most providers now are,

499
00:21:21,469 --> 00:21:22,939
are completely broken.

500
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,699
Right. It's, it's terrible

501
00:21:24,869 --> 00:21:28,540
and, and they always side with the corporations.

502
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,300
You have to, you look at like,

503
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,000
have you ever read any of the stories about

504
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:35,819
the youtube copyright strikes and just madness around that.

505
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:36,680
It's crazy

506
00:21:36,979 --> 00:21:40,729
having silence taken down rainfall, taken down people who,

507
00:21:41,109 --> 00:21:41,619
you know,

508
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,949
are the band that produced that song and then somebody used it in

509
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:49,160
a commercial and had the band's music taken down and that's the best.

510
00:21:49,489 --> 00:21:49,910
Yeah.

511
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,839
And well,

512
00:21:50,849 --> 00:21:51,989
and it's going to be a million times

513
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,569
worse with that insane European copyright directive.

514
00:21:54,819 --> 00:21:58,449
If that thing goes through, man, it's gonna be,

515
00:21:58,939 --> 00:21:59,739
I,

516
00:22:00,739 --> 00:22:03,599
I have a suspicion, what you're going to see is

517
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,400
people just won't care.

518
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:08,599
It'll be one of those situations where youtube says, screw you.

519
00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:10,300
-- You
-- have to, you'll get fined

520
00:22:10,489 --> 00:22:12,449
-- and,
-- and they can find them.

521
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:13,079
And

522
00:22:13,329 --> 00:22:14,099
I, I don't know,

523
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:14,920
I,

524
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:18,339
we will see, I guess I, I feel like this is going to be,

525
00:22:18,349 --> 00:22:20,119
-- it's
-- about two weeks away at this point

526
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,579
and then you have 24 months to

527
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,030
correct

528
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:22,989
like GDPR.

529
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,280
If it passes, we'll ignore it for two years and then, oh my God, we'll all panic

530
00:22:26,449 --> 00:22:27,160
and have

531
00:22:27,699 --> 00:22:31,150
whatever the content equivalent of those cookie warnings is.

532
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,369
No, I, I suspect it will pass.

533
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,290
And then two years from now we're going to have an absolute gong show of a mess. Yeah.

534
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,410
That's probably fair.

535
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:44,050
I don't know. I don't know. Anyway, anyway, back to the topic of content filtering

536
00:22:44,219 --> 00:22:47,569
and I think from the perspective of security

537
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,130
there is

538
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,969
the idea. Sounds like it makes sense.

539
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:54,849
-- Well,
-- and especially subjective content filtering.

540
00:22:54,939 --> 00:22:56,079
It is subjective.

541
00:22:56,089 --> 00:22:57,390
That's a very good point.

542
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,670
But I, I think it's one of those ideas that sounds like it makes sense.

543
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,209
But I think it's, it's like it's like electronic voting

544
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,939
in theory, it doesn't sound that bad, but in practice,

545
00:23:07,949 --> 00:23:12,479
-- it is a bag of snakes and there is no way you're going to do it
-- right.

546
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,689
Filtering toxic comments.

547
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,390
I can give you a 12th elevator pitch which is

548
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,420
now you don't have to see some of the really,

549
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,099
really horrendous stuff on the internet

550
00:23:20,329 --> 00:23:23,859
and maybe like youtube actually pay people to look at videos who then

551
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:27,020
end up with ptsd because the stuff they're seeing is so horrific.

552
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:31,140
So there is actually a valid but like there is a real benefit

553
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:34,750
to automating this and that is we don't break all these poor moderators

554
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,979
who are either doing this for free or getting paid

555
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:37,920
and like

556
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:41,140
they're seeing stuff that is just so horribly bad

557
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,260
-- that it defies explanation. They
-- are.

558
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:48,959
But if, if we can't fix those sort of things, how is this going to be better?

559
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,619
Well, I think this would be part of that, right?

560
00:23:52,329 --> 00:23:55,250
And you know, it's, it's this technology just won't be used on its own.

561
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,140
For example, you,

562
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:58,010
you start filtering toxic comments that may be

563
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,689
linked to videos and you start saying,

564
00:23:59,699 --> 00:23:59,949
oh, you know,

565
00:23:59,959 --> 00:24:04,060
we're seeing a high correlation of toxic comments linking to videos that are toxic.

566
00:24:04,089 --> 00:24:07,910
-- No,
-- you know, OK. So here's what I'm going to pick on though about that is

567
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,020
so

568
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,229
well, It's a, it's a bad example, but

569
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,459
it is a terrible example because I,

570
00:24:13,469 --> 00:24:16,339
have you ever clicked on a couple of youtube videos that,

571
00:24:16,349 --> 00:24:19,760
that maybe are we'll say questionable content in some ways.

572
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:20,660
And I remember,

573
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:22,380
do you mean the Elsa Gate stuff?

574
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:23,979
Right. Like any of that?

575
00:24:23,989 --> 00:24:24,439
And I mean,

576
00:24:24,449 --> 00:24:27,400
I remember at one point it was clear that youtube was starting to think

577
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:30,479
I'm like a white supremacist because I watched the video and I'm like,

578
00:24:30,489 --> 00:24:31,099
holy crap.

579
00:24:31,109 --> 00:24:34,660
No, like quit showing me this garbage. I don't want any and there's no way

580
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:38,089
to really fix it other than just I started watching like,

581
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:40,420
things that were the opposite to be like youtube.

582
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,890
Quit, stop this.

583
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:46,790
I've, I've had that problem occur with uh Amazon and it's suggestions of what to buy.

584
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,319
And I'm like, no, II, I was just browsing that I actually don't want to buy that

585
00:24:50,545 --> 00:24:54,645
and do I need to like, go buy some normal safe items now to like, reset my.

586
00:24:54,895 --> 00:24:58,005
-- Right. Right.
-- My filters serious. Because I was just,

587
00:24:58,354 --> 00:25:00,645
that's what I hate about these A I systems.

588
00:25:01,094 --> 00:25:03,344
-- They, they get out of control
-- and there's no recourse.

589
00:25:03,354 --> 00:25:05,954
It's not like I can appeal to Amazon and be like, can you please?

590
00:25:06,354 --> 00:25:11,244
Like, I mean, I just was curious if you sold powdered aluminum and iron,

591
00:25:11,564 --> 00:25:12,935
I didn't actually want to make thermal.

592
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,494
I just wanted to see if it was available.

593
00:25:15,785 --> 00:25:17,074
You know, please stop trying to,

594
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,099
no,

595
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:18,640
tell

596
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:19,079
me

597
00:25:19,189 --> 00:25:21,099
I'm on a watch list now for, you know,

598
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:23,339
making explosives probably.

599
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:24,670
Yep. Yep. Exactly.

600
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,739
And like that's the, that's one of the things that just scares me to death is that if

601
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:32,589
either by accident or even on purpose groups

602
00:25:32,709 --> 00:25:34,819
abuse this and you end up

603
00:25:34,939 --> 00:25:38,660
just, it, it, it could easily go off the rails and again,

604
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,140
we end up in a position where humans are starting to look at it.

605
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,780
And now these poor humans, like you said,

606
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:47,500
are getting ptsd because of the just horrific things they have to watch or read.

607
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:47,939
And

608
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,199
it's,

609
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:53,680
uh, man, they, they, again, in theory, I think it's a great idea,

610
00:25:53,689 --> 00:25:55,839
but I think in practice it is impossible.

611
00:25:55,849 --> 00:25:57,729
Well, here's a question though, even if it's impossible,

612
00:25:57,739 --> 00:25:59,400
is it better than doing nothing?

613
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,260
And I

614
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:01,609
be,

615
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,229
the answer is a strong, maybe. I, I don't know,

616
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:05,500
I

617
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:10,000
don't know if maybe is good enough, but it is definitely a maybe. And,

618
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:10,989
and it's,

619
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:16,119
I, I always say this and I, I especially pick on security people of, we love to be, say,

620
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:18,699
you know, if it's not perfect, it's not worth doing.

621
00:26:18,709 --> 00:26:21,260
And that's usually not true.

622
00:26:21,689 --> 00:26:24,260
And I don't think that's true. In this case.

623
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,050
I think the question becomes,

624
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:29,260
where do we draw our lines and what do we define as acceptable?

625
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,060
Because

626
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:33,739
it's, this is like new territory as humans.

627
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:38,369
We don't have any sort of anything to draw on, to educate us on this.

628
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:41,199
-- And
-- it's, oh, yeah, we've never had anything remotely.

629
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:42,400
I mean, the, the

630
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:46,680
right, like, the only thing we're really good at is seeing lions in the grass,

631
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,239
all of this other stuff.

632
00:26:49,349 --> 00:26:51,000
We have no idea.

633
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:52,890
No, I would agree 100%.

634
00:26:53,199 --> 00:26:56,280
So, I, I don't know. I, I have no idea. And it, it's

635
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:58,119
my guess is it's going to take a couple

636
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,579
of generations to figure some of this out just because

637
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:03,339
you and I did not grow up with the internet. So

638
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:03,839
that,

639
00:27:03,849 --> 00:27:08,599
like our internal wiring in our brains can't just can't deal with a lot of this stuff.

640
00:27:08,609 --> 00:27:11,380
Well, and, but part of the challenge is we don't have generations to deal with this.

641
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:11,680
But

642
00:27:11,979 --> 00:27:15,660
I mean, this technology, I look at how far technology has moved in the last 20 years.

643
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,199
You know,

644
00:27:17,209 --> 00:27:20,359
the computers I'm buying and the devices I'm buying literally

645
00:27:20,369 --> 00:27:22,439
look nothing like what I had 20 years ago.

646
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:26,550
-- Uh
-- That is correct. But I think that is the new, the new mindset.

647
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,239
The youth are acquiring is just the constant change.

648
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,119
Like, in our case, when we were growing up,

649
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:31,760
I mean,

650
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:34,369
let's face it from probably the 19 fifties ish

651
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,609
to probably what the mid to late nineties,

652
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:39,079
the technology wasn't drastically different.

653
00:27:39,089 --> 00:27:41,359
Like, yeah, you got a computer in your house. Isn't that neat?

654
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:44,560
Look, it can play these crappy games. But as soon as the internet came, just Kapa,

655
00:27:44,969 --> 00:27:48,400
-- everything went off the rails.
-- Well, a simple example,

656
00:27:48,619 --> 00:27:49,170
Felix,

657
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,400
we have to plug a keyboard into the computer because

658
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:53,339
you can't just tell a computer what to do.

659
00:27:53,349 --> 00:27:55,079
Oh, wait, no, actually

660
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:57,469
that analogy doesn't work anymore.

661
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:01,150
What kind of piece of crap computer is this?

662
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,380
Yeah, exactly. I was like, no, wait, it's windows.

663
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,670
It has, uh, I want to say Cortana, Cortana.

664
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:08,599
So I was like,

665
00:28:09,329 --> 00:28:12,489
but I was like, yeah, wait a minute. I, that's a bad analogy, you know.

666
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:13,709
Yeah. Whoops.

667
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,910
Yeah. Exactly. Exactly.

668
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:20,069
Yep. Yep. I hear you, man. It's like that. The Star Trek, what is it? Star Trek four.

669
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:21,239
When Scotty was talking about

670
00:28:22,449 --> 00:28:23,229
computer,

671
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:24,030
the

672
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,910
computer. Right.

673
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,839
No, you, you know, you have to, you have to push,

674
00:28:27,849 --> 00:28:29,969
push the buttons and then of course he goes crazy.

675
00:28:29,979 --> 00:28:33,520
Like, he, he a typing speed of, you know, like, 300 words a minute. Yeah.

676
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,280
He, like, cracks his knuckles and,

677
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:35,760
yeah.

678
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:36,599
Right. Right.

679
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:40,140
And he, he, he gives us with transparent aluminum which if, if,

680
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,359
for those of you listening you've never seen Star Trek Four.

681
00:28:42,369 --> 00:28:45,319
It's fantastic. Go watch it. There are whales in it. Right.

682
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:46,719
Which,

683
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,489
which ironically were, it was a concern.

684
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,890
They were going to go extinct back then and then it wasn't. And now it might be again.

685
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,359
So

686
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:55,290
hooray always relevant

687
00:28:55,510 --> 00:29:00,589
anyway, I think we should, we should start wrapping this one up, I guess. Yeah,

688
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:01,449
I,

689
00:29:01,939 --> 00:29:04,869
I hope what Google wants to do succeeds.

690
00:29:04,969 --> 00:29:07,069
But I think I'm equally terrified.

691
00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:07,369
It

692
00:29:07,739 --> 00:29:12,479
-- is going to go wrong in a
-- terrible way. Well, and my concern too is even if

693
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:16,479
let's just spherical cows for a moment, let's say they build an A I

694
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:21,239
that objectively just filters the really, really horrible, horrific stuff.

695
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,439
Part of my concern is,

696
00:29:22,449 --> 00:29:24,530
is that then we ignore those people and they end up in

697
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,300
their own crazy echo chamber and like that guy in Toronto,

698
00:29:27,329 --> 00:29:28,839
they end up renting a van and driving down

699
00:29:28,849 --> 00:29:31,280
the sidewalk trying to run over women or something equally

700
00:29:31,689 --> 00:29:34,939
-- bonkers.
-- It, it, it is. And you and I,

701
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:36,439
so

702
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,689
Kurt and I talk about this all the time and he has

703
00:29:39,699 --> 00:29:41,890
a pretty firm position if we have to try and I have

704
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,530
a pretty firm position of like these people are too far gone

705
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:47,640
to save and I don't think we'll ever agree on this topic,

706
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:49,079
but I, I, we also

707
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:53,239
will say polite enough to one another that we agree to disagree

708
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:53,979
and

709
00:29:54,099 --> 00:29:56,890
that is how debate in society should work.

710
00:29:56,910 --> 00:30:00,430
Well, actually, I, I would say I partly agree with you.

711
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,420
Right. II, I hold, I hold mutually opposing viewpoints on this topic

712
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,209
and I'm just not sure

713
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:08,109
-- that's
-- fair.

714
00:30:08,229 --> 00:30:09,619
But yeah, I'm just not sure.

715
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:15,900
-- I don't know, man, may
-- maybe we need A I trolls to infect these toxic communities and,

716
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,849
and brainwash them back.

717
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:21,500
Like, speaking of Brexit, I'm pretty sure that's how we got there.

718
00:30:23,229 --> 00:30:26,819
I don't, those weren't A I trolls. Those were Russian trolls. It's fine.

719
00:30:26,869 --> 00:30:29,479
Well, yeah, you don't even, you don't even have to try that hard

720
00:30:29,729 --> 00:30:31,670
-- anyway.
-- All right, I'm, I'm calling it

721
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,239
before we get ourselves on a list.

722
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,699
