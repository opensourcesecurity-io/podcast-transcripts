Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself.

1
00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:13,020
Kurt Siefried and my partner who is now possibly one or two hours away from me.

2
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:13,850
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:14,890
-- Oh,
-- come on.

4
00:00:14,899 --> 00:00:17,819
I asked Kurt to open this with my partner in Daylight

5
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:21,239
savings crime because I think daylight savings is a crime.

6
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:21,889
But

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,989
I don't, I don't know what time it is for you.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,340
Do you, did you change your clocks, like, two days ago, three days ago?

9
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,360
No, because the computers do that,

10
00:00:29,569 --> 00:00:32,959
whatever. Actually, I have three clocks in my house. I have to manually change.

11
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,520
-- Yeah,
-- I have about a dozen.

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,040
Wow, that's, well, I have all these, like, humidity, temperature

13
00:00:38,459 --> 00:00:40,509
sensor on it. Like sensors that have cloths.

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,509
They're little cheap ones.

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,000
And I actually found they made a huge difference because I, I,

16
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:46,419
the upstairs temperature of the house gets real

17
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,919
wonky because all the heat rises and blah,

18
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:48,389
blah, blah.

19
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,119
And so I put these temperatures and because basically,

20
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,360
yeah, I was getting too hot to sleep and I'm like, what's going on? Well, heat rises.

21
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:55,729
Yeah. Imagine that.

22
00:00:55,979 --> 00:00:56,340
So,

23
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,159
why do they have clocks? Who cares?

24
00:00:58,209 --> 00:01:01,849
Well, because that's it, it just it has temperature, humidity, clock

25
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:02,979
dates.

26
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,099
It's the cheapest one you can buy on Amazon.

27
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,940
I got you. I got, you just take a piece of tape and cover up the time

28
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,459
-- anyway. Anyway,
-- it's, it's,

29
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:15,970
I find daylight savings maddening because right next door to us is Saskatchewan.

30
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,239
And they've just never done it and they, they seem ok.

31
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,970
-- It's
-- the dumbest thing ever. I'm actually really jealous.

32
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,660
I work with some people who live in Oregon, the country in the United States

33
00:01:25,029 --> 00:01:25,400
and

34
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:26,650
the

35
00:01:27,309 --> 00:01:28,809
state, a state, whatever.

36
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,260
It's, it's, it's,

37
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,029
man, I'm not, I'm not doing well. I'm serious.

38
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,099
Like daylight saving every time I change the clocks. I'm not right for a week

39
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,139
anyway,

40
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:38,580
the state

41
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,400
of Oregon

42
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,480
never has to change their clocks again. And I am so jealous of that.

43
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,620
And it's one of those catch 22.

44
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:46,000
Like I know,

45
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,269
I'm pretty sure BC has a law on the book saying they can get

46
00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:51,019
away from it as soon as the US to the south of them does.

47
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:51,580
But,

48
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:55,099
right, because trade partners, like you don't want to for six months of the year,

49
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,139
be an hour off from your major trade partner.

50
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,449
I mean, that seems fair.

51
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,900
Although, although

52
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:03,010
I used to live in the state of Indiana, which,

53
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:07,559
when I lived there did not observe daylight sings and I found it very frustrating to

54
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:12,199
struggle to know what time it was anywhere but where I lived and I kept complaining,

55
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:17,770
but then, then they instituted daylight savings and I assure you that was worse.

56
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:20,639
So, like, take that for what it's worth.

57
00:02:21,179 --> 00:02:22,699
I, I just, I love that.

58
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,330
It's such a perfect example of things in security that people

59
00:02:25,339 --> 00:02:27,979
just don't want to change because it would mean changing something.

60
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,399
-- That's right.
-- Change is hard. So, let's just never change

61
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,440
anyway. Anyway.

62
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:32,429
All right.

63
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:35,669
-- Speaking
-- of change. So, things have changed a little bit

64
00:02:35,779 --> 00:02:35,809
at

65
00:02:35,929 --> 00:02:37,910
-- Github.
-- That's the worst transition

66
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,860
ever. And now it's our sponsor.

67
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,509
Nothing's changed at github.

68
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:46,149
-- Well,
-- no, they, they, they, they forcibly took down an exploit code.

69
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:46,990
They did.

70
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,389
There was an exploit for the recent Windows exchange.

71
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:54,509
Well, no, it was not an exploit. It was a proof of concept.

72
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,460
-- I thought it was
-- weaponized.

73
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,110
The original one was not weaponized.

74
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,309
Ok. Well, either way, who cares

75
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:05,380
github? Someone put up a proof of concept. Github yanked it

76
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,350
and

77
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,449
everyone's crying foul because Microsoft owns github and obviously this,

78
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,259
this exploit was targeting

79
00:03:12,429 --> 00:03:14,690
Windows operating systems.

80
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,360
And now there's this big debate about was this good or bad or what's going on?

81
00:03:20,369 --> 00:03:23,029
Well, so one thing is number one,

82
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,679
like most websites that allow posting content,

83
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,910
they have a phone book of restrictions,

84
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,320
right?

85
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:32,110
So they acceptable use policy compliance with laws, blah, blah,

86
00:03:32,119 --> 00:03:34,080
blah content restrictions, you know,

87
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:38,020
ah here we go is unlawful or promotes unlawful activities.

88
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:40,179
And then the next one that might be applicable

89
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,789
is contains or installs any act of malware or

90
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,460
exploits or uses our platform for exploit delivery such

91
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,419
as part of a command and control system or

92
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:49,630
uh infringes any proprietary

93
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,800
right of any party, including patent trademark, trade secret, copyright,

94
00:03:52,809 --> 00:03:54,149
right of publicity or other, right.

95
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:57,570
So basically the first two are kind of the most applicable here.

96
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,610
The problem is that means any

97
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:04,750
hacking tools technically fall under this, like like Net catt is widely used by

98
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:08,160
pen testers and bad guys to the point where Net Catt actually gets, you know,

99
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:12,070
detected by some A V programs and stuff as being a malicious thing.

100
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,190
Yep. Yep.

101
00:04:13,309 --> 00:04:16,220
And I mean, it's just Net Cat, it's just a network socket.

102
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,369
-- Actually,
-- you know what's really wild is I was helping someone I work with,

103
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,450
they were basically building there was this,

104
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:25,070
this uh security detection rule that they were trying to bypass.

105
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:28,450
And basically the rule had a 10 minute window where

106
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:31,929
if Net Catt starts and then Net Catt connects, then flag it. So

107
00:04:32,149 --> 00:04:35,059
he's like, I just want to start Net Catt because there's a,

108
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,170
there's a version of Net Catt that is like like a little command line type

109
00:04:38,429 --> 00:04:41,839
the interface. He's like, I want to start Net Cat wait 10 minutes

110
00:04:41,989 --> 00:04:45,510
and then do stuff. And he's like, I'm struggling to do this with a shell script.

111
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,239
And I said, well, let's just use Python.

112
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,559
And so I, you know, cranked out a little Python script to do it for him.

113
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,399
And Yeah, like sure enough, that's all it took.

114
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,119
And then I said, I'm like, why don't you just flag all net catt traffic?

115
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,459
And he said you wouldn't believe how much of the cloud is run with Net Catt

116
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,119
-- behind the scenes. And I became
-- scared.

117
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,940
-- Yeah, when you need to move data from system A to system B
-- well,

118
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:07,040
not even just data like like connections between,

119
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:08,829
between microservices and stuff.

120
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:12,309
-- And I'm like, that's horrifying to me
-- like it works man

121
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,570
and a developer

122
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,540
given a choice between it works and it doesn't work.

123
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:20,910
We'll choose, it works every single time, especially it works with no other setup.

124
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,529
No keys, no passwords. No, no,

125
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,570
nothing to set up. It just works.

126
00:05:25,989 --> 00:05:26,500
So

127
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,179
github yanked a demo exploit

128
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,940
and you know what? I guess here's the way I've been putting this into my brain is

129
00:05:35,309 --> 00:05:36,420
I don't agree with it,

130
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,369
but it's well within their rights. Yeah.

131
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,750
Part of it is the optics are bad and I also wonder

132
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:45,970
what does this accomplish? Like here's the thing, what are the pros and cons?

133
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,040
There's because there's a whole pile of cons like some

134
00:05:48,049 --> 00:05:49,959
of the communities annoyed with them and so on.

135
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,140
-- What are the actual pros to yanking it though?
-- I think

136
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:57,350
they were probably under fire. There is a certain,

137
00:05:57,619 --> 00:05:59,089
I think group of people

138
00:05:59,369 --> 00:06:03,010
that have this obsession with keeping things secret even though it

139
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:05,940
wasn't a secret and it's available all over the freaking internet.

140
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:09,429
-- Even
-- worse. All the exchange servers that can be hacked have been hacked.

141
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,750
Yeah, basically.

142
00:06:10,929 --> 00:06:12,989
No, really. But that does make a bit of a difference.

143
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,390
It's not like, basically all the bad that can happen has largely happened.

144
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:20,670
Well, not necessarily. I mean, it's always amusing when you see

145
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:20,959
II,

146
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:25,209
I set up an elastic search honey pot one time and it kept getting hacked back and

147
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,809
forth from two different pieces of malware And it amused me to no end to watch them,

148
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:34,290
like, constantly flip every couple of hours, a different one came in and hacked it.

149
00:06:34,299 --> 00:06:38,440
-- It was
-- if somebody had a proof of concept or an exploit code that wasn't widely used,

150
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,829
there is potentially some value in taking it down

151
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:43,829
because it slows the spread of people using exploit,

152
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,049
you know, to attack things.

153
00:06:45,059 --> 00:06:48,510
-- But at this point, every exchange server had been hacked.
-- I disagree.

154
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:50,140
I don't think it's slow to spread at all because

155
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:52,510
the people who are going to actually weaponize this stuff,

156
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:54,700
they had a copy long before it hit github

157
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:58,649
-- guaranteed. Right. Well, in this
-- case, yes, but I'm talking more in general.

158
00:06:58,779 --> 00:06:59,649
Ok. Ok.

159
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:04,609
But I think, but I bet even in general it's probably very true where the bad guys,

160
00:07:04,619 --> 00:07:07,820
-- they have ways of getting stuff like this that isn't
-- github.

161
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:09,200
Sell it to each other.

162
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:12,380
-- Right.
-- But anyway, anyway, I, I do think

163
00:07:12,549 --> 00:07:15,700
there is this cult of secrecy that has developed

164
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:18,299
inside of security and I think it is unhealthy.

165
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:20,049
It's not that it developed inside of security.

166
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:21,809
It actually, from doing my reading,

167
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,929
it was largely imported from the military because

168
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,660
the military has a very rich history of,

169
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,029
well, the phrase, if you can see the target, you can kill the target.

170
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,670
Right. And it's true because if you, you know, it's true in real life. Yeah.

171
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:33,950
Well, but the problem is they,

172
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:37,920
they've moved these metaphors directly over to information security

173
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,850
and they sort of work, but not 100%.

174
00:07:41,859 --> 00:07:44,670
And so they have this idea that, for example, you know,

175
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:46,859
if we can control the flow of information and

176
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:48,489
prevent people from knowing what a gun is,

177
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,970
then we don't have to worry about guns being used to attack us.

178
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,750
Right.

179
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,619
Yeah. No, that ship sailed guys. It sounds good.

180
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,100
Like if, oh,

181
00:07:55,109 --> 00:07:58,220
if we don't let the Attackers have any details about the security

182
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,299
vulnerabilities and we don't let them have exploit codes and everything.

183
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:02,839
They'll be at such a disadvantage. And the answer is, well, no, they won't.

184
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,910
Where do you think these exploits are coming from in the first place?

185
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,179
Like people find them,

186
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,260
like people like me and Josh can find them.

187
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,100
-- You don't need to be that sophisticated
-- and we're not what I was gonna say.

188
00:08:12,109 --> 00:08:13,059
We're not smart.

189
00:08:13,929 --> 00:08:14,339
Right.

190
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,970
Right. No, I agree completely.

191
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:22,019
And I think the, the true danger in all of this and this harkens back to

192
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:26,130
various discussions that I know we've had in the past and I think I wrote,

193
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,489
I might have written a blog post.

194
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,700
I'll see if I can dig it up. But basically deleting

195
00:08:29,805 --> 00:08:33,825
stuff like this, I think creates a false sense of security where people think, oh,

196
00:08:33,835 --> 00:08:36,226
it's exploitable but the exploits not out there.

197
00:08:36,236 --> 00:08:38,745
And the exploit is 100% out there.

198
00:08:38,755 --> 00:08:41,655
And I think making it on, available on something like

199
00:08:41,926 --> 00:08:42,866
github is,

200
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:48,426
you can't pretend it's not there because like it's literally right there.

201
00:08:48,435 --> 00:08:50,815
And I think that's part of the thing is it's the whole,

202
00:08:51,012 --> 00:08:52,512
the emperor has no clothes situation.

203
00:08:52,841 --> 00:08:54,531
I think it's really what it boils down to

204
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,711
100%. And people do not.

205
00:08:56,882 --> 00:09:00,872
People who are invested in the emperor supposedly wearing pants do not like that.

206
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,392
Like a brief search on Google. Actually, I found something better than it.

207
00:09:04,401 --> 00:09:09,752
It's, it's a huge blog posting like, oh my goodness, this is like 1020 pages long

208
00:09:09,932 --> 00:09:12,031
and it's, it's walking you through how

209
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:15,450
-- the exploit works and how to build one.
-- Oh That's very exciting.

210
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,109
Send that, send that to me. I'll put it in the show notes but I want to read it.

211
00:09:18,669 --> 00:09:19,270
It's

212
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:19,460
uh

213
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,549
yeah, I mean, and that's the thing, right? This, this is not hidden information.

214
00:09:24,359 --> 00:09:28,460
I think part of the challenge is this didn't really accomplish much.

215
00:09:28,469 --> 00:09:31,950
I mean that from the practical side, from, for example, a legal side,

216
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,030
it did accomplish a lot.

217
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,549
It, it made Microsoft's lawyers. Probably much less grumpy and angry.

218
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:39,950
No. Really? Well, because when we both worked at Red Hat. Right.

219
00:09:40,054 --> 00:09:41,094
That was one of the mantras.

220
00:09:41,104 --> 00:09:45,294
Is that Red Hat could never share or disclose

221
00:09:45,304 --> 00:09:48,655
anything kind of exploit Cody that could remotely,

222
00:09:48,664 --> 00:09:50,354
ever end up being weaponized.

223
00:09:50,364 --> 00:09:52,174
-- That's true.
-- That's totally understandable.

224
00:09:52,184 --> 00:09:54,914
Like large companies, you know, they have to worry about these things.

225
00:09:54,924 --> 00:09:55,335
No,

226
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,835
I'm going to call BS on that because I think I

227
00:09:57,844 --> 00:10:01,265
suspect nothing bad would ever happen but try convincing the lawyers.

228
00:10:01,275 --> 00:10:07,434
Well, no, no, no. The lawyer's job is to be overly paranoid about everything

229
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:12,080
and the job of business leaders is to tell the lawyers we've listened to your

230
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:17,489
feedback and this is a decision we're going to make against your better judgment,

231
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,349
maybe in some cases and sometimes that's ok.

232
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:22,099
Sometimes, obviously it feels miserably.

233
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:26,039
I think when you end up in a situation where the lawyers are driving the bus,

234
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:29,049
it's becomes a sad pathetic bus.

235
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,820
Oh, absolutely. I mean, and maybe that happened here, we'll never know.

236
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,109
I mean,

237
00:10:33,119 --> 00:10:36,429
it would not shock me if Microsoft had zero input into this

238
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,830
decision and github just was like off on their own doing it.

239
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,599
I don't know.

240
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:40,760
Well,

241
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,729
and that's the other thing people treating these companies like they're

242
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:45,830
big cohesive entities that know what's going on with each other.

243
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,619
Right? Like, come on.

244
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:52,090
No, it's like, it's like a dumpster barely held together by string.

245
00:10:52,099 --> 00:10:55,239
These companies sue each other internally all the time,

246
00:10:55,450 --> 00:11:00,200
Sony's content production division suit their anyway, Sony sued up part of itself

247
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:01,580
and the thing is too,

248
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:05,119
there is massive value in the good guys having

249
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,489
exploit code two main things being number one,

250
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,760
the vendors that want to

251
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:13,280
create signatures for this or, you know, some sort of workaround or something.

252
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,599
And number two, the people who are basically saying, look,

253
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:20,440
we really need to patch this and we need to do it now and we need to have some downtime.

254
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:25,000
And no, I mean, it, because now here's this, see, look what happens when I do this,

255
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:25,750
tap, tap, tap.

256
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,700
-- And now I'm admin
-- now, one of the arguments

257
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:30,780
I heard was people were saying, oh,

258
00:11:30,789 --> 00:11:33,859
you shouldn't like wait and give people time to patch.

259
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:37,929
But the hilarious thing about this is it was actively exploited for several

260
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,010
weeks before the patch came out and like everything was already pun.

261
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:41,690
So

262
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:45,010
let, let's, let's pretend that's not the case. And let's pretend

263
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:45,960
that

264
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:50,530
patch comes out, exploit comes out same day, right? What do you think now?

265
00:11:50,539 --> 00:11:53,010
-- Well,
-- so here's a question, what is a quote unquote,

266
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,809
reasonable amount of time to give people to patch,

267
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,369
-- right? A day? 30 days,
-- more than zero hours maybe.

268
00:11:59,739 --> 00:12:01,489
-- Well, but how long? No, I want a number. Come
-- on.

269
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,179
So, I mean, I don't have an opinion on this because

270
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:05,099
I,

271
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:08,500
I've experienced this from every possible way you can imagine.

272
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:13,450
There's plenty of organizations that, that patching immediately is not an option.

273
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,200
And I understand that well,

274
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,609
-- and
-- also remember that one year where a whole bunch of attack,

275
00:12:17,715 --> 00:12:17,734
uh

276
00:12:18,184 --> 00:12:20,705
exploits dropped and if they dropped, like two weeks later,

277
00:12:20,715 --> 00:12:22,215
they would have consistently fallen on, you know,

278
00:12:22,224 --> 00:12:24,575
holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas and New Year's.

279
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:26,655
And so here's the reality.

280
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:31,005
Would it be nice that everybody had like a solid 30 days of no exploitation to patch?

281
00:12:31,015 --> 00:12:32,945
And then after 30 days the exploit code

282
00:12:32,955 --> 00:12:35,184
goes out and whatever bad things happen happen.

283
00:12:35,304 --> 00:12:35,474
Yeah.

284
00:12:35,484 --> 00:12:37,765
But we don't live in that world and trying to

285
00:12:37,775 --> 00:12:40,054
pretend that we live in that world is insane.

286
00:12:40,349 --> 00:12:41,210
I, I agree.

287
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,619
That's like saying you shouldn't look both ways when you cross the street at a

288
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,090
pedestrian crosswalk because you have the right of way and it's a marked crosswalk.

289
00:12:47,489 --> 00:12:48,760
Yeah. Tell that to the old lady.

290
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,450
They got run over by a city bus, you know, two years ago.

291
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,010
And, and I think you can,

292
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:56,150
there's always going to be people who argue the ethics of releasing

293
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,890
an exploit without waiting some amount of time.

294
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,210
And I don't think it matters how long you wait.

295
00:13:00,219 --> 00:13:02,239
-- There's always going to be someone who complains.
-- Absolutely.

296
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,276
But here's the real problem I find with this whole thing,

297
00:13:04,286 --> 00:13:06,005
you can argue the ethics and morality of this.

298
00:13:06,015 --> 00:13:08,955
All you want. The reality is the world isn't that way.

299
00:13:09,046 --> 00:13:11,356
There will be bad guys who will do this stuff.

300
00:13:11,366 --> 00:13:14,515
I don't want to blame the victim but it has to get better

301
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:17,416
and faster at patching stuff because that's the world we live in.

302
00:13:17,426 --> 00:13:22,406
If you can't patch stuff or fix stuff quickly or release an update quickly, you're,

303
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,276
you're doomed to failure.

304
00:13:23,286 --> 00:13:23,565
I mean,

305
00:13:24,015 --> 00:13:26,252
I think that you, this,

306
00:13:26,262 --> 00:13:29,562
this conversation might have been valid in the early two thousands.

307
00:13:29,572 --> 00:13:30,952
But I think today, like

308
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,281
it, it's move fast or die. I mean,

309
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:37,591
well, or stop doing that and outsource it to somebody who's better at it than

310
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:39,781
no, no, no, like II,

311
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:42,322
I understand why so many places have infrastructures

312
00:13:42,331 --> 00:13:44,762
because that's what they've done for 2030 years.

313
00:13:44,771 --> 00:13:47,281
You know, MS uh, managed service providers, you know,

314
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,762
helping small medium businesses

315
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,200
with their, you know, Microsoft Exchange server,

316
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,950
their Microsoft business server, whatever the products are called now.

317
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,919
And cool, I get that.

318
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:57,159
But also I'm sorry,

319
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:02,400
as much as I hate on these huge monoliths like Aws and Microsoft 365.

320
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:03,679
The reality is

321
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:06,150
that's where we're headed and that's what works

322
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:07,590
and it's cheaper and it's less hassle.

323
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:10,215
And I get that there's regulatory issues and compliance issues

324
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,914
for a lot of people who are outside the US.

325
00:14:12,205 --> 00:14:14,815
But again, the world is the way it is and we can

326
00:14:14,945 --> 00:14:18,934
try and argue and say ethically blah, blah, blah, but it's that,

327
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:19,765
that's not going to happen.

328
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:23,575
I mean, I, I kind of agree. I think you have to plan for

329
00:14:23,765 --> 00:14:26,094
any time a critical security

330
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,789
update comes out.

331
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:32,780
-- You should expect that the bad guys have an exploit
-- even simpler.

332
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,599
There's been a whole pile of S sds

333
00:14:34,609 --> 00:14:37,559
with firmware issues that break after 40,000 hours.

334
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,479
And so if you can't,

335
00:14:39,609 --> 00:14:43,679
for example, take your storage server array down to update the firmware,

336
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,669
so it doesn't die after $40,000.

337
00:14:45,724 --> 00:14:49,594
-- Which is what, like three or four years,
-- you're not going to have much of a choice,

338
00:14:49,604 --> 00:14:50,364
are you?

339
00:14:50,594 --> 00:14:53,864
-- Yeah.
-- And I mean, I, I get that, it's painful to take down your main storage array.

340
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:54,585
Like that's,

341
00:14:54,715 --> 00:14:56,765
you know, everything else breaks when you do that.

342
00:14:56,775 --> 00:14:58,804
But the reality is you have to be able to do that.

343
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,354
You know, I don't want to own a spare tire,

344
00:15:00,364 --> 00:15:03,984
but I just spent 200 bucks buying a full size tire for my spare tire.

345
00:15:04,044 --> 00:15:04,885
So that if my,

346
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:05,445
you know,

347
00:15:05,455 --> 00:15:07,864
I don't have to run on a donut tire for God

348
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,895
knows how long if I'm out of the cabin or whatever,

349
00:15:10,984 --> 00:15:13,614
you know, and I can't get, I can't get tow truck service out there.

350
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,349
Why

351
00:15:15,489 --> 00:15:15,599
I

352
00:15:15,809 --> 00:15:18,150
don't go places without internet. So it's fine.

353
00:15:18,369 --> 00:15:18,799
So,

354
00:15:19,469 --> 00:15:21,000
you know, there's, there's the world

355
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,669
we want to have and in that world, yeah,

356
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:26,489
there wouldn't be exploits and there wouldn't be people pulling stuff.

357
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,159
There'd be secure software that just works well. No, we don't have that world

358
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,000
and there's the world we have where

359
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,559
there are bad people doing bad things to your systems and

360
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,359
if it takes you 30 to 90 days to patch them,

361
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:41,320
well, basically you're screwed.

362
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:45,219
Or you need to start doing some addition layers of security, like only allowing,

363
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:48,669
you know, VPN access and hoping that none of your workstations get popped.

364
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:51,690
-- I mean,
-- maybe anyway, I want to move on because I think,

365
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,099
I think we beat this one to death.

366
00:15:53,109 --> 00:15:57,520
I guess we would love to hear why we are wrong, please. At Kirk

367
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:59,549
-- on Twitter.
-- Well, people will tell us why we're wrong.

368
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,580
It'll be the same old reasons of, oh, this gives Attackers blah, blah, blah,

369
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:03,099
whatever.

370
00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:06,619
Well, the same can be said for a copy of, you know, programming C++

371
00:16:07,479 --> 00:16:10,270
Yeah, don't, don't use that either because that's probably more dangerous than

372
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:10,419
the

373
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,309
anyway. Anyway. All right.

374
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:13,789
OK. OK.

375
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:16,869
I want to move on to the next thing we wanted to talk about and this is the,

376
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:20,869
the Linux Foundation has announced a new open source software signing service

377
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,429
and they're calling it sig store.

378
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,950
And from what I understand

379
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:30,429
the intent is to make it significantly easier for open source developers to sign

380
00:16:30,729 --> 00:16:34,450
their releases with some sort of trusted signature.

381
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,979
Yeah, here's the problem with signing an encryption in general is at some point,

382
00:16:37,989 --> 00:16:41,359
you have to have a piece of trusted thing that is securely stored A K

383
00:16:41,489 --> 00:16:45,109
-- A, the private key. Well,
-- they're actually doing some clever things with this.

384
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:47,880
-- And exactly, and that's part of what they've addressed here.
-- Yeah.

385
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,770
And see, that's always the problem I had where everybody's like, oh,

386
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,309
all software developers should sign their software securely.

387
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,590
I'm like, cool. You're all going to buy them,

388
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,609
you know, five or six hardware tokens and give them, you know,

389
00:16:57,619 --> 00:16:59,580
a safe deposit box to keep a spare one in case

390
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,340
their house burns down and so on and so forth.

391
00:17:01,349 --> 00:17:01,690
No,

392
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,719
this solves a lot of those problems.

393
00:17:03,729 --> 00:17:06,400
But the problem is software signing doesn't really

394
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,979
-- do what people think it does.
-- Well, I know that's what makes it funny.

395
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:14,189
Well, and it's very similar to https in that respective https,

396
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,069
doesn't really do what people think it does.

397
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,108
Well, so here's my favorite part of this.

398
00:17:18,118 --> 00:17:21,390
And now I think I want to, I want to start this out by saying,

399
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,260
I think the Linux Foundation and

400
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,709
what Red Hat's part of this and there's some other companies,

401
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,780
I think this is marvelous and I think

402
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,969
this is exactly the right thing to do

403
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:33,489
and I'm hopeful they make it a community and not a committee.

404
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,699
But I think all in all this is a great idea.

405
00:17:35,709 --> 00:17:38,069
-- I
-- hope they make it as simple as less encrypt with CF bot.

406
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:41,300
-- No, seriously, it needs to be that
-- it does, it needs to be simpler.

407
00:17:41,709 --> 00:17:42,020
But

408
00:17:43,339 --> 00:17:45,930
the thing that made me laugh out loud

409
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:49,890
is everyone's talking about this in the context of the solar winds attack,

410
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,119
this would not have fixed the solar

411
00:17:52,229 --> 00:17:53,359
winds attack

412
00:17:53,469 --> 00:17:53,640
because

413
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:56,650
you would have released signed malware.

414
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,119
-- Well,
-- and,

415
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:01,349
but more to the point they did monkey with the signed binaries and the response was,

416
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:03,319
oh, yeah, just smash that

417
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,119
and install it and ignore the signature error.

418
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:06,849
That too.

419
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:07,849
Right. So

420
00:18:07,969 --> 00:18:10,530
that's the thing. It, it, again, it reminds me a lot of

421
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,530
tps and that we have this whole online certificate,

422
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,109
something protocol that, you know,

423
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:17,670
you can check if the certificate is still valid or not.

424
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,949
Right? Has it been revoked?

425
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,910
The problem is you turn that on

426
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:21,780
and number one,

427
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,380
you have a performance hit because every time you hit

428
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,489
a site you have to ask is the certificate valid from

429
00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:27,930
privacy hit.

430
00:18:27,939 --> 00:18:29,689
And I was about to get to that the privacy and now you're

431
00:18:29,699 --> 00:18:32,729
telling everybody where you're going to look for stuff up until recently,

432
00:18:32,739 --> 00:18:36,719
most of these uh, certificate vendors couldn't run a reliable enough

433
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:38,209
revocation system.

434
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:41,459
Like it just, it wasn't up 24 7. So, and if it's down, what do you do?

435
00:18:41,469 --> 00:18:44,280
Do you feel closed and stop browsing the web or do you

436
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,300
keep going anyways? Because it's probably not that bad.

437
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,689
Well, the answer is if you keep going anyways because it's not that bad.

438
00:18:48,699 --> 00:18:50,829
That means the attacker can just block the request and

439
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:54,520
yeah, now revoke certificates don't show up as revoked. That's right.

440
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:57,040
That's right. So, yeah, this whole software signing thing.

441
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:00,719
I like it because what it basically allows a software developer to do

442
00:19:00,729 --> 00:19:03,089
is to do a bunch of work come up with an artifact,

443
00:19:03,099 --> 00:19:05,880
be it a tar ball of source code or a binary

444
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:08,770
and then sort of freeze it in amber

445
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,619
and if it's signed

446
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:13,699
using something like this, they can sort of wash their hands of it and be like, look,

447
00:19:13,709 --> 00:19:14,780
I'm done, I've released it.

448
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,660
Anything that happens past here is kind of not my problem

449
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,890
unless the signing key leaks.

450
00:19:20,569 --> 00:19:20,670
Yeah,

451
00:19:20,989 --> 00:19:21,819
trust it.

452
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:26,920
Well, and, and that speaks to having, you know, like a, like public repos of,

453
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:30,040
you know, here's the signature, here's the hash, here's what, you know,

454
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:32,770
the file name is and where it is and part of me would like that too,

455
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,000
just for discovery of stuff.

456
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:34,359
Right.

457
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,640
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I agree.

458
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:38,479
There's another side to this as well, which is,

459
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,709
there are loads of projects

460
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,489
that sign what they do today

461
00:19:43,689 --> 00:19:47,829
and literally nobody checks the signatures and I won't lie. I'm a security guy.

462
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,630
The number of signatures I've checked is probably 10 or less like in my career.

463
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,910
Unless it happens automatically

464
00:19:55,439 --> 00:19:56,420
nobody checks.

465
00:19:57,199 --> 00:20:01,459
And I, I remember Souza Lennox sent out a security advisory.

466
00:20:01,469 --> 00:20:05,020
This is like over a decade ago, maybe a decade, whatever, a long time ago

467
00:20:05,189 --> 00:20:07,569
and they improperly signed it and I

468
00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:09,079
noticed it was not properly signed.

469
00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:11,500
So I contacted them and they re-released it properly signed.

470
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:13,459
And then about a week later, I condo, I'm like,

471
00:20:13,469 --> 00:20:15,819
how many people actually complained and he's like three

472
00:20:16,689 --> 00:20:18,439
that's higher than I expected.

473
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:23,349
But here's the thing, the signature things and computers kind of fail so often.

474
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:24,219
We just sort of

475
00:20:25,569 --> 00:20:29,520
because, and 99 times out of 100 it is not an attack. It is

476
00:20:29,689 --> 00:20:33,000
-- a glitch.
-- It's like, it's not just 99 out of 100 current.

477
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:38,439
It's like nine trillion nine. You know what I mean? It's like 100 nines out of

478
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,359
100 and one. You know what I mean?

479
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:43,369
-- It's,
-- well, except for that one time it was the Attackers at solar winds.

480
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,510
It's almost right. It's so rare,

481
00:20:45,729 --> 00:20:49,439
but even then, like, signatures wouldn't have necessarily solved that problem.

482
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:52,540
-- And
-- that's the other conception is that signatures are here to stop this.

483
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,319
No, they're, they're an alarm.

484
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,589
They're not

485
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:59,160
in my mind. Signatures are meant to be like a tripwire funnily enough.

486
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:02,650
There's a product actually called Tripwire that signs all your files and monitors,

487
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,469
monitors them for changes to

488
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:07,869
say whoa, oh, this file changed. Maybe an attacker did something.

489
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,390
Maybe your admin was monkey in there.

490
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,130
-- Tripwire
-- is a hilarious example because as soon as you update your system,

491
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:17,569
which you need to be doing on a regular basis, Tripwire loses its mind

492
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,209
and the fact that Tripwire doesn't handle

493
00:21:19,316 --> 00:21:19,666
better,

494
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,336
that's shameful

495
00:21:21,686 --> 00:21:22,296
assuming

496
00:21:22,505 --> 00:21:23,556
they don't. But whatever

497
00:21:23,735 --> 00:21:26,676
the point is that it's, it's like http S,

498
00:21:26,686 --> 00:21:30,026
it's every time you hit a site that's broken in some way.

499
00:21:30,215 --> 00:21:31,926
The user offered a choice.

500
00:21:32,036 --> 00:21:36,755
Do you want to proceed? Right. And unless you are in the HSTS preload list.

501
00:21:36,786 --> 00:21:39,296
And now it's interesting is if you're in that preload list,

502
00:21:39,306 --> 00:21:42,176
it will not let you bypass certificate errors.

503
00:21:42,186 --> 00:21:43,796
The number of people doing that is a couple of

504
00:21:44,021 --> 00:21:44,582
websites.

505
00:21:44,592 --> 00:21:47,222
Well, when things break, they don't want it to break, break,

506
00:21:47,232 --> 00:21:49,041
they want people to ignore that error and go on

507
00:21:49,052 --> 00:21:52,112
-- to their banking website
-- or go buy things for me.

508
00:21:52,121 --> 00:21:55,241
-- Right.
-- So that speaks to me that the reliability of these systems,

509
00:21:55,442 --> 00:21:59,291
you know, I have a smoke alarm every day. About, between nine and 10 o'clock.

510
00:21:59,302 --> 00:22:03,582
-- I get an alarm because I cook bacon.
-- You cook bacon every day.

511
00:22:03,671 --> 00:22:06,381
Yeah, two strips of bacon, two or three eggs every day.

512
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,011
It's my breakfast, like clockwork,

513
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,427
it's Keto and it's actually low calorie.

514
00:22:10,437 --> 00:22:12,637
But anyways, the point is every day I, you know,

515
00:22:12,647 --> 00:22:14,508
because I like to cook my bacon a little crispy.

516
00:22:14,517 --> 00:22:17,067
I get a smoke alarm. Right. And it's annoying. Like, you know,

517
00:22:17,557 --> 00:22:20,937
I got to whack, I'm tall enough that I can just hit the thing and tell it to shut up.

518
00:22:20,947 --> 00:22:23,897
I've considered moving the smoke alarm out of the kitchen and then I'm kind of like,

519
00:22:23,907 --> 00:22:26,287
well, that sort of defeats the whole purpose of having one.

520
00:22:26,297 --> 00:22:29,328
-- I
-- mean, it totally defeats the purpose of having a smoke alarm. I agree.

521
00:22:29,437 --> 00:22:32,787
Like that, that, that, that is the most likely place to have a fire in my,

522
00:22:33,284 --> 00:22:37,573
when I had my whole house rewired, I made them put a smoke alarm next to my furnace.

523
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:38,234
The guy's like,

524
00:22:38,374 --> 00:22:40,764
you don't need this for code. I'm like, I don't care what code says.

525
00:22:40,774 --> 00:22:43,843
-- Put the freaking smoke alarm,
-- dude. Carbon monoxide. Right.

526
00:22:43,854 --> 00:22:44,144
Right.

527
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,734
Carbon monoxide and smoke detector.

528
00:22:45,744 --> 00:22:46,173
I'm like,

529
00:22:46,183 --> 00:22:49,384
this is literally the place I'm going to need

530
00:22:49,394 --> 00:22:51,313
this more than anywhere else in this whole basement.

531
00:22:51,323 --> 00:22:53,624
Like put one there, put one over there, it'll be fine.

532
00:22:53,683 --> 00:22:57,343
-- Yeah,
-- I have two boxes of fire in my house. One is in the kitchen and one is my furnace.

533
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:58,310
Yeah. Right.

534
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:58,869
Exactly.

535
00:22:58,969 --> 00:22:59,859
Seems pretty.

536
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:00,209
Anyway.

537
00:23:00,459 --> 00:23:00,520
Anyway,

538
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:05,020
the point is until these systems essentially have, you know, zero false positives,

539
00:23:05,229 --> 00:23:07,390
almost no hassle to set up and use.

540
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,910
-- It's just not gonna happen
-- and, and look, I think the,

541
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,910
the thing sig store needs to do

542
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:15,329
and I, I don't, I,

543
00:23:15,535 --> 00:23:18,834
from what I've read, I don't think this is true yet, but it's very early. So we'll see.

544
00:23:18,844 --> 00:23:21,875
But there, there seems to be a lot of focus on the developers.

545
00:23:21,964 --> 00:23:26,755
Whereas the focus needs to be put on the consumption because if consumption is hard,

546
00:23:26,765 --> 00:23:28,435
who cares if it's even signed?

547
00:23:28,444 --> 00:23:29,954
Because no one's going to verify it,

548
00:23:30,244 --> 00:23:33,354
they'll try, they'll fail and they'll smash that ignore button.

549
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:34,489
Yeah, exactly.

550
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,310
And you get, like,

551
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:39,260
basically in the world of security you get one chance and if you screw up,

552
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:42,660
people decide you're an idiot and they never ever want to talk to you again.

553
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,119
Well,

554
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,859
or they change the default to just allow

555
00:23:44,869 --> 00:23:46,989
any unsigned binary from anywhere to run which,

556
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,469
you know, I have to do this on my Macs because I want to run software that I need

557
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:54,449
that isn't available through the App store, for example, or

558
00:23:54,609 --> 00:23:56,949
whatever, you know, and I'm not talking dodgy stuff.

559
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:59,650
I'm actually talking reasonably legitimate household names.

560
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,810
-- But
-- even then, I mean,

561
00:24:00,819 --> 00:24:03,979
things like signed executables on Windows and Mac

562
00:24:03,989 --> 00:24:06,010
researchers have shown time and time again,

563
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,770
it's trivial to sign malware.

564
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,569
Like,

565
00:24:08,729 --> 00:24:12,989
so again, that speaks to signing doesn't do what people think it does, you know,

566
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,530
a website certificate for td.com.

567
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,310
What is td.com? Well, it actually happens to be my bank,

568
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:20,089
you know,

569
00:24:20,189 --> 00:24:22,390
but walmart.com pretty sure that's Walmart.

570
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,130
But what about like Walmart dot Some random new top level domain?

571
00:24:26,619 --> 00:24:27,810
Is that

572
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:29,319
Walmart? Well,

573
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:29,500
hell,

574
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:29,819
I,

575
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,150
I would assume it is because I would hope Walmart is

576
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,989
smart enough to register every Walmart dot Something on the planet.

577
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,010
-- I don't know,
-- man, there's a lot of TL DS now.

578
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,599
-- Is it,
-- it's 1500 or 2000, 300.

579
00:24:39,609 --> 00:24:43,760
-- I forget which, and
-- I imagine it is up to the right on a regular basis.

580
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,849
Well, it's a, what is it?

581
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:48,410
$180,000 give or take to set up a TLD and it's a,

582
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,089
it's a way to print money because people do defensive registrations.

583
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,140
Yeah. Right.

584
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,699
That's what it boils down to

585
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:56,380
the signing has to work perfectly for both the cons,

586
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,020
the creation and the consumption.

587
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,910
There has to be essentially no false alarms because

588
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:04,880
if you have more than two or three false alarms for every real alarm,

589
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:05,619
people ignore it.

590
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,619
And we're talking, you know,

591
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,500
hundreds or thousands of false alarms for every real alarm here.

592
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:10,819
Yeah.

593
00:25:10,989 --> 00:25:11,400
And

594
00:25:11,569 --> 00:25:15,010
my favorite thing too is I would run into software that had a signature error.

595
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,400
And, well, what do I do now?

596
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,270
And, you know,

597
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,140
I would try and report it and it was invariably

598
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,500
some sort of glitch or error or just got ignored.

599
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:24,329
90 9% of the time if I try to install

600
00:25:24,339 --> 00:25:27,550
something and it says the signature is invalid or whatever,

601
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,369
I'm going to ignore it and do whatever it takes to get

602
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,250
it installed because I probably need it to get something done.

603
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,780
-- And I don't care about the stupid warning.
-- Pretty much.

604
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:37,900
-- The thing I do is I fire it through virus
-- total. Yeah.

605
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,020
Actually I've taught my kids, like, all their,

606
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,880
all their mods they install for their games.

607
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:43,780
I'm like, put it through virus total every time.

608
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,520
I mean, so far it's working but like,

609
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:49,939
even that isn't obviously 100% but I feel like it's close enough that it'll work.

610
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:54,800
We get these Excel Macro viruses via Gmail,

611
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:58,239
but actually flag in virus total in two or three of the Chinese ones.

612
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,319
But none of the rest. And it's so bizarre

613
00:26:01,229 --> 00:26:02,829
because I would have always assumed that.

614
00:26:02,949 --> 00:26:06,560
Well, I know the virus companies share virus samples.

615
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:07,439
Right.

616
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:07,949
I mean,

617
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:11,079
it's in their own best interest because otherwise coverage would be a nightmare.

618
00:26:11,089 --> 00:26:11,630
But, uh, yeah,

619
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,420
it's weird to me that these things do detect by a

620
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:16,250
handful of vendors but the majority of them don't detect.

621
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,180
It's very strange and,

622
00:26:17,189 --> 00:26:19,569
and that speaks to the whole false positive versus

623
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:22,569
real positive versus false negative and real negative.

624
00:26:22,579 --> 00:26:25,560
The numbers right now that we have are, are hysterically terrible.

625
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:29,989
Yeah, I agree. And so people just get alarm fatigue and ignore these systems. Yeah.

626
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,329
-- And
-- I mean, that's, that's going to be the challenge right now. You said something.

627
00:26:33,339 --> 00:26:37,130
I think that's really interesting that I've got turning in my brain is

628
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:39,069
you talk about this has to be perfect.

629
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:40,130
And the thing is,

630
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,069
I think you're right in the context of encryption because

631
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:46,219
encryption is a very all or nothing sort of universe.

632
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:46,910
But

633
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,989
now obviously building perfect things is virtually impossible,

634
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,040
but especially building like a brand new, perfect way to sign and verify things is

635
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,750
a horrifying thought and, and I don't think they can do that,

636
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,829
but it's also creates a very high bar for the point where you can call it good enough.

637
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:05,944
Here's part of the problem to this is something where when it goes wrong,

638
00:27:05,954 --> 00:27:09,535
-- you're expecting a human being to pay attention and take action and
-- that's true too.

639
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:10,655
When it does fail,

640
00:27:10,665 --> 00:27:13,824
humans have to get involved and that creates another high

641
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:16,685
-- bar and
-- so you can't false alarm them constantly.

642
00:27:16,694 --> 00:27:18,214
Yeah. Yeah. Right.

643
00:27:18,224 --> 00:27:20,474
You can't constantly, you know,

644
00:27:20,484 --> 00:27:22,984
it'd be like having a buzzer in your car that any

645
00:27:22,994 --> 00:27:26,005
time if you were not going to break and hit something,

646
00:27:26,015 --> 00:27:26,844
the buzzer goes off.

647
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:29,905
Well, of course, you're going to probably break and not hit stuff constantly.

648
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,829
But imagine if you had a buzzer that went off every time, you know,

649
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:34,709
you're driving at 60 kilometers an hour

650
00:27:34,829 --> 00:27:37,270
towards a red light where there's cars stopped while

651
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,979
the buzzer goes off because unless you start braking,

652
00:27:38,989 --> 00:27:39,890
you're going to slam into them.

653
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,329
Right.

654
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:41,920
That buzzer would get

655
00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:43,280
the hammer treatment

656
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,270
right away

657
00:27:44,439 --> 00:27:45,430
probably.

658
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:45,800
And,

659
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:48,880
and that's kind of the situation where we are is we get all these false positives.

660
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:52,319
We get alarm fatigue, the humans have to ignore it because it's just, it's,

661
00:27:52,329 --> 00:27:53,400
it's tiresome.

662
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:56,719
Well, and I, I think this, I mean, in the context of cars,

663
00:27:56,869 --> 00:28:02,099
the solution isn't to warn humans. It's to just not let humans drive

664
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:04,420
-- or take them out of the loop.
-- Well, yeah. Right.

665
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:08,939
You know, with adaptive braking or whatever stuff or full driving at some point.

666
00:28:08,949 --> 00:28:12,270
So, yeah, and I hate saying it has to be perfect,

667
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,569
but when something alarms and involves a human being,

668
00:28:15,579 --> 00:28:17,439
it has to be close to be perfect.

669
00:28:17,469 --> 00:28:21,319
Or the humans will very quickly learn that it cries wolf and it needs to be ignored.

670
00:28:21,339 --> 00:28:23,719
Yeah. I mean, I kind of agree with that. I think,

671
00:28:23,939 --> 00:28:28,239
I mean, alarm fatigue is a problem, especially in security and, and we all know it,

672
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,479
it's, it's easy to say it's hard to fix.

673
00:28:30,489 --> 00:28:34,589
People who design these systems need to be a lot more aware

674
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:36,099
and careful

675
00:28:36,349 --> 00:28:37,479
with how

676
00:28:37,689 --> 00:28:39,800
they interact with the users, especially

677
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,119
grabbing their attention and time

678
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:45,410
and, and I guess we're going to find out

679
00:28:45,949 --> 00:28:50,089
if, if, if it, if it works because I, I do think

680
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:57,089
a project like this is hugely important. I think it is going to be very easy to goof up

681
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,310
and

682
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:59,270
I,

683
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,229
I am hopeful

684
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,189
that

685
00:29:02,489 --> 00:29:05,829
the right people are working on this in a way that will be impactful.

686
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:06,989
Stupid question.

687
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,420
Have we ever seen anybody discuss the metrics of this security product?

688
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:13,670
How much human time and attention does it eat up? I don't think I've ever seen that.

689
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:16,390
I bet that's not a friendly number.

690
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,000
Yeah, because I,

691
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:20,209
I very specifically will not do anything security

692
00:29:20,219 --> 00:29:22,189
wise that requires my care and feeding.

693
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,489
And that's a good,

694
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:28,369
-- that's a good one.
-- It has to be set it and forget it or I'm not touching it.

695
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:30,010
Yeah.

696
00:29:30,439 --> 00:29:30,459
Yeah.

697
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:31,849
I mean

698
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:32,979
that,

699
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:33,930
I, I don't know.

700
00:29:33,949 --> 00:29:38,979
Something else we need to think about is this is being touted as a great solution to

701
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,770
supply chain security.

702
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:46,619
Whereas this is solving such a narrow problem that isn't really even a problem.

703
00:29:46,709 --> 00:29:49,739
Well, it's also solving a problem at the end of the supply chain.

704
00:29:49,849 --> 00:29:52,640
Yeah, there's so much else we need, think about and

705
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:56,660
hopefully this doesn't turn into a, oh, this project will fix it.

706
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,680
I remember,

707
00:29:57,689 --> 00:29:59,719
I remember from the early Red Hat days

708
00:29:59,729 --> 00:30:02,189
we were transitioning to the Brew build system.

709
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:04,910
Brew is what Fedora was using to build packages.

710
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:09,520
And the running joke became brew will fix it for no matter what the problem is.

711
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,640
Brew will fix it

712
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,790
and for supply chain, I truly hope we don't end up in a situation of,

713
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,979
oh sig Store will fix that when it's like, no, it won't.

714
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:20,359
You can't keep saying that because it's not true.

715
00:30:20,369 --> 00:30:23,979
-- Well, do you know what's in your banana bread?
-- My banana bread has bananas in it.

716
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,839
Yeah, hopefully.

717
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:28,579
But I mean, that's what always gets me is these, what is in your software and they go,

718
00:30:28,589 --> 00:30:28,939
what do you mean?

719
00:30:28,949 --> 00:30:29,180
I'm like,

720
00:30:29,189 --> 00:30:30,939
give me an exact list of what's in your software

721
00:30:30,949 --> 00:30:33,619
and what's it licensed for and prove to me that,

722
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:37,050
you know, these four offensive words don't exist in your code base at all.

723
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,180
And they're like, uh

724
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,579
and, and I think like SB

725
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:42,290
is vastly more important

726
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:43,469
and the SBA

727
00:30:43,689 --> 00:30:44,459
universe

728
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,459
like the tooling is terrible.

729
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:50,339
The data formats are terrible like everyone talks about it but,

730
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:51,459
but it's a hard problem.

731
00:30:51,469 --> 00:30:54,469
-- It is, it is, it totally is.
-- It is straight up a hard

732
00:30:55,162 --> 00:30:56,032
and, and again,

733
00:30:56,162 --> 00:30:56,833
again,

734
00:30:56,963 --> 00:31:01,182
this has to be 100% automated because if you have humans curating your list, it

735
00:31:01,483 --> 00:31:04,363
is out of date and wrong. No questions asked. Right.

736
00:31:04,373 --> 00:31:08,172
Like it has to be a magic system anyway. Anyway, we've run ourselves out of time.

737
00:31:08,182 --> 00:31:10,692
This has been, I feel, I feel like I,

738
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:14,083
I have no conclusions to either of the things we talked about today.

739
00:31:14,093 --> 00:31:17,633
-- I think it's
-- progress because there are, at least we're trying new things

740
00:31:17,682 --> 00:31:17,873
and,

741
00:31:17,883 --> 00:31:18,483
and that's true.

742
00:31:18,493 --> 00:31:21,483
And I think just making sure you're, you're talking about it,

743
00:31:21,493 --> 00:31:23,762
even if you don't come to a conclusion

744
00:31:24,076 --> 00:31:25,365
after the conversation, just,

745
00:31:25,375 --> 00:31:29,416
just getting these in our brains to think about is I think a big first step.

746
00:31:29,426 --> 00:31:29,625
Well,

747
00:31:29,635 --> 00:31:32,965
and hopefully understanding it a bit better so we can maybe make better decisions,

748
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:36,855
you know, look at what has and has not worked in the past, what has failed,

749
00:31:37,076 --> 00:31:40,125
look at how current systems fail and, and build on that.

750
00:31:40,135 --> 00:31:43,015
That's a really good point when things do fail,

751
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:47,105
like write down why it failed and turn that into data you can reuse

752
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:51,125
because I do think we are notorious for anytime we do something good.

753
00:31:51,135 --> 00:31:53,066
We're like, oh yeah, look what we did this worked

754
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:55,819
and we still don't really turn it into reasonable data, but like,

755
00:31:55,829 --> 00:31:59,229
especially when you fail, like that's valuable knowledge and we, we,

756
00:31:59,239 --> 00:32:01,030
we almost never talk about it, I guess.

757
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,829
Yeah, we'll, we'll end it there. So, thank you. Kurt. Thank you ever for listening.
