Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast

1
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,199
episode 176 with myself, Kurt Siefried

2
00:00:11,319 --> 00:00:13,140
and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:13,409 --> 00:00:18,059
-- All right.
-- So I just need to clarify for everyone listening right now

4
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,270
that Kurt wants to do a predictions episode because we're

5
00:00:22,819 --> 00:00:26,540
at the point of recording, we're at the end of the decade

6
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,229
and I think prediction episodes are dumb

7
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:32,400
-- and predictions are dumb.
-- And I predicted you would say that

8
00:00:33,189 --> 00:00:33,599
you,

9
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:35,909
of course, that's not a prediction.

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,659
That's because I told you they're dumb yesterday.

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,220
And

12
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:44,529
in all seriousness, unless your name is like Arthur C Clarke,

13
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:46,799
your predictions are terrible.

14
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,069
Oh, I'm, I'm ok with that.

15
00:00:49,419 --> 00:00:49,880
So

16
00:00:50,169 --> 00:00:54,000
I was recently reading one of Charles Strauss's blog postings and

17
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,439
talking about basically how the future is.

18
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,119
Like 90% of it is basically here right now. It's just going to be tweaked a little bit

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,519
and like 9% we can sort of extrapolate out, like smartphones will get smarter,

20
00:01:04,529 --> 00:01:07,500
they'll get more capability faster, better, you know, like, you know,

21
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,500
you can extrapolate out

22
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,169
but, and then there's like 1% that just doesn't exist

23
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:13,190
at least.

24
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:16,919
And, and he suspects that number those ratios have changed.

25
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:17,330
You know,

26
00:01:17,339 --> 00:01:20,819
so there's more that doesn't exist now that will because I think part of it is what

27
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,069
makes predictions so tough nowadays is the adoption

28
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,637
cycle for technology that is successful is short.

29
00:01:25,647 --> 00:01:26,986
Maybe we'll put the chart in the show notes.

30
00:01:26,997 --> 00:01:28,577
But that adoption chart of like, what is it?

31
00:01:28,586 --> 00:01:33,166
Electricity, radio TV, phones, internet, smartphones, right.

32
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:36,976
And for it to get from like 0 to 10 to 20 to 80 whatever percent adoption,

33
00:01:37,086 --> 00:01:37,357
you know,

34
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,516
-- being shorter and shorter and
-- shorter.

35
00:01:39,527 --> 00:01:42,997
I believe that I don't know if I've ever seen that chart.

36
00:01:43,007 --> 00:01:44,957
I suspect I have, but I,

37
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:49,677
I always think back to the fact that the iphone came out at what, 2006

38
00:01:49,963 --> 00:01:50,634
and

39
00:01:50,954 --> 00:01:55,194
I couldn't imagine living my life without a smartphone.

40
00:01:55,204 --> 00:01:59,113
And I don't even mean in the context of communicating with people necessary.

41
00:01:59,124 --> 00:02:02,674
Just the fact that everyday life when I go on a trip now

42
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:04,033
my phone

43
00:02:04,263 --> 00:02:05,473
is my ticket.

44
00:02:05,634 --> 00:02:07,594
It's how I get my taxi.

45
00:02:07,874 --> 00:02:11,473
It's how I know where I need to be at any given point in time.

46
00:02:11,483 --> 00:02:14,324
-- Like it is, it is an amazing tool
-- one first,

47
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:18,671
I just upgraded from an iphone se because I managed to cook the recharger on it,

48
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,501
hot air like it was mounted on my car,

49
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,781
the hot air, but I thought it was closed anyways

50
00:02:23,091 --> 00:02:26,591
and I upgraded to an iphone. Um jeez, I don't even know. I want to say an eight maybe.

51
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,100
Ok. So not like top of the line, but, you know, a lot better than iphone. I see.

52
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,901
And I'm already noticing between that and I also got an Apple watch,

53
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,220
like my usage of Siri,

54
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:38,660
some of the stuff I'm doing and able to do now so much easier and new capabilities.

55
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:38,951
And

56
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,770
I mean, if you made me go back to an iphone se I'd hit you with, I'd hit you with a hammer.

57
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:46,330
I believe that my, my example actually would be Alexa,

58
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,559
which I'm still morally opposed to the surveillance society it represents.

59
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:52,610
But

60
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:57,330
I got some smart light bulbs as a Christmas gift last Christmas.

61
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:59,860
And I'm like, what do I do with these things?

62
00:02:59,869 --> 00:03:02,020
And I'm, I thought all right, you know what, I'm going to get an Alexa

63
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,740
and I'm going to see what I think of this.

64
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:07,479
And my house is filled with smart light bulbs now

65
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:10,740
because not having to get up and turn lights on.

66
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,449
Has for whatever reason,

67
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,500
I love the fact that I just scream at a machine and it works the lights for me.

68
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:20,529
-- It's marvelous.
-- I actually have two Alexa little routine set up.

69
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:23,479
One is Alexa Good morning and one is Alexa Goodnight and the good morning, one

70
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,020
turns all my, uh, the lights in my room

71
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:30,029
tells me a joke and tells me the weather report and I find that that actually

72
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,690
helps wake me up because like, otherwise I wake up and I'm like, well,

73
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:34,630
if I don't get out of bed,

74
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:37,029
I don't know if there's no lights on and the bright lights don't hurt my eyes.

75
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:39,179
So I'm just going to stay here where it's cozy.

76
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,220
Yeah, I, I should do the, I should try it good morning.

77
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:44,589
So I tried to set up a good night routine

78
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,029
and for whatever reason,

79
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:49,669
it turns off all my lights because I actually have

80
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:52,740
some lights on my garage that turn on at night and

81
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:56,104
-- turn off in the morning.
-- You gotta build groups like the light bulb.

82
00:03:56,115 --> 00:03:56,914
I have, you can set,

83
00:03:57,475 --> 00:04:01,615
I did that. I have groups and it still turns the stupid garage lights off.

84
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,985
And I've tried like everything my guess. I don't know

85
00:04:04,095 --> 00:04:07,274
if I, if I email them or call them, they're gonna tell me, oh, just like,

86
00:04:07,285 --> 00:04:11,085
remove everything and start over and re add them all and I'm too lazy to do that.

87
00:04:11,095 --> 00:04:13,774
So, whatever I will survive without Goodnight.

88
00:04:13,785 --> 00:04:16,994
-- Well,
-- I've already had to do like one complete reset of all my light bulbs and like

89
00:04:17,605 --> 00:04:18,404
them and just, uh,

90
00:04:18,704 --> 00:04:19,725
-- I
-- don't
-- want to do that.

91
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:25,299
-- It's a chore.
-- So anyway, predictions, we are not predicting anything at best.

92
00:04:25,309 --> 00:04:26,329
We're discussing

93
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,170
-- our dystopian present
-- came up with sort of four main predictions

94
00:04:30,179 --> 00:04:33,700
that are extrapolations of what we have because quite frankly,

95
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:36,459
I can't really that, that creating the future

96
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:36,760
whole

97
00:04:36,869 --> 00:04:37,329
cloth

98
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:38,190
anyway,

99
00:04:38,299 --> 00:04:40,760
security predictions or just predictions,

100
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:41,790
predictions. Yeah,

101
00:04:42,309 --> 00:04:44,579
excellent because this is a security podcast.

102
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:46,779
The first thing and this is a clear extrapolation because

103
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,600
I got an email from Google about it last week

104
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,029
is that

105
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:54,820
the usage of passwords for very high value

106
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:57,709
accounts is going to be strongly discouraged.

107
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,510
So what's happening with Google is you can use your

108
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,600
Google account for single sign on with other stuff,

109
00:05:01,609 --> 00:05:02,200
right?

110
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:04,339
And you can also have apps that for example,

111
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,079
make use of your Google account for something like uh

112
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:07,929
like caliber

113
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,200
Ereader to send email.

114
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:10,200
You, you put your pass,

115
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,510
you put your user name and password into the app so that

116
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:14,239
the app can connect to your Google account and send an,

117
00:05:14,552 --> 00:05:14,812
you know,

118
00:05:14,821 --> 00:05:18,502
to your Magic Amazon or whatever account to get the document onto your Kindle,

119
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:18,842
right?

120
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:19,402
Ok.

121
00:05:19,582 --> 00:05:22,242
I didn't know it could do that, but I'm not surprised to learn it.

122
00:05:22,471 --> 00:05:27,372
Yeah. And so basically Google is phasing out what they call less secure access LS A.

123
00:05:27,381 --> 00:05:29,522
And so essentially sometime next year,

124
00:05:29,532 --> 00:05:33,111
you basically won't be able to register any new LS A integrations.

125
00:05:33,122 --> 00:05:37,231
So we have a bunch of Gmail accounts, you know, that are fed by aliases. And

126
00:05:37,372 --> 00:05:39,441
basically, you know, email goes to the alias goes to the

127
00:05:39,584 --> 00:05:42,074
email account and then Jira connects to the Gmail account.

128
00:05:42,084 --> 00:05:43,634
Like I think it's every 10 minutes or a half hour

129
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:46,194
or whatever pulls up the email generates tickets from them,

130
00:05:46,204 --> 00:05:47,223
you know, the usual right?

131
00:05:47,234 --> 00:05:49,164
Ticket to or email to ticket integration thing.

132
00:05:49,174 --> 00:05:52,283
And of course, it uses uh you know, user name and password. Well, that will

133
00:05:52,473 --> 00:05:53,954
stop working, you know,

134
00:05:53,963 --> 00:05:57,864
in uh I think they said the drop dead date for all of this stuff is in 2021.

135
00:05:57,873 --> 00:06:02,723
So at that point, like if you want to access your Google account, you will have to,

136
00:06:02,734 --> 00:06:04,313
you know, do it properly.

137
00:06:04,324 --> 00:06:04,723
Like

138
00:06:04,825 --> 00:06:07,335
if you want to set up an integration with something, it will have to be o

139
00:06:07,605 --> 00:06:08,726
-- off.
-- I think that's great.

140
00:06:08,776 --> 00:06:11,006
-- Yeah, I agree completely.
-- That's your prediction.

141
00:06:11,365 --> 00:06:11,705
So

142
00:06:11,816 --> 00:06:13,716
my prediction is, I think Facebook will do this.

143
00:06:13,726 --> 00:06:16,455
I think Google will do this, maybe Twitter and a couple of the other big guys.

144
00:06:16,485 --> 00:06:18,955
And the second part of this and Google is doing this

145
00:06:18,966 --> 00:06:22,645
already again is the sanitization of passwords in Google Chrome.

146
00:06:22,656 --> 00:06:25,415
Now it automatically checks your password to make sure

147
00:06:25,425 --> 00:06:28,455
it's not in the database of publicly known passwords.

148
00:06:28,466 --> 00:06:29,925
That's not a prediction either.

149
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:30,660
No,

150
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,720
I'm predicting that more people will do this

151
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,869
and hopefully it becomes wide scale adoption.

152
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:42,079
OK? I mean, this is an easy one. I think I feel like we're already on this path.

153
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,779
This would make a big difference because like the recent ring quote

154
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:46,399
unquote doorbell hacking was just the

155
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:46,730
fact of

156
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:48,160
his own credentials,

157
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:48,540
like

158
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,970
publicly disclosed credentials to get into people's ring accounts.

159
00:06:51,364 --> 00:06:55,725
And like on the one hand, I'm like, well, that's not really hacking. It's like,

160
00:06:55,924 --> 00:06:57,665
you know, you find a box of keys on the street.

161
00:06:57,674 --> 00:07:00,244
So you just start going up to doors and try all the keys,

162
00:07:00,864 --> 00:07:01,355
you know?

163
00:07:01,674 --> 00:07:02,815
But at the same time, yeah, I mean,

164
00:07:02,825 --> 00:07:05,834
it is hacking or cracking in the sense of malicious activity.

165
00:07:05,845 --> 00:07:06,255
Right.

166
00:07:06,565 --> 00:07:06,804
You know,

167
00:07:06,815 --> 00:07:08,315
even if you find keys on the street you shouldn't

168
00:07:08,325 --> 00:07:10,234
just go randomly trying to go into people's houses.

169
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,510
It's still illegal.

170
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,160
Yeah. It's very much frowned upon in most places.

171
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:18,890
-- Right.
-- Because the, the sad reality is passwords are here to stay.

172
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:24,320
-- We, you know, we might get rid of them in 50 years.
-- Now. That's a prediction. I, I

173
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,230
-- don't
-- know.

174
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,679
I have a feeling that, you know, we're,

175
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,119
we're stuck with them because it's what we have.

176
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,390
-- It's what we know. That's just how it is.
-- Ok.

177
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:34,109
-- Ok. What else you got
-- as far as encryption goes? So,

178
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:39,075
-- IPs a clearly didn't win. Remember IPs a 20 years ago?
-- Thank goodness it lost. I hate

179
00:07:39,196 --> 00:07:39,335
ips.

180
00:07:39,686 --> 00:07:43,765
-- Now we're shoving wire guard into the Linux kernel. I like
-- wire guard. It's,

181
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:45,795
it's pretty nice,

182
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:51,335
but I'm predicting that application level encryption will continue to win.

183
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:54,496
So, an example of that would be DNS over http S Kurt,

184
00:07:54,506 --> 00:07:56,816
we call this zero trust networking.

185
00:07:57,765 --> 00:07:58,265
It's, again,

186
00:07:58,446 --> 00:08:00,115
this isn't a prediction.

187
00:08:00,126 --> 00:08:00,675
Well, I'm,

188
00:08:00,686 --> 00:08:04,135
I'm guessing though that wire guard is going to essentially go the way of IP

189
00:08:04,411 --> 00:08:05,242
where, I mean,

190
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:08,421
do you think it will ever see adoption of more than 1% in the Linux server market.

191
00:08:08,502 --> 00:08:08,941
No,

192
00:08:09,092 --> 00:08:12,212
no, I don't because zero trust networking is like you said,

193
00:08:12,221 --> 00:08:15,981
all about kind of application level encryption where you're just

194
00:08:15,992 --> 00:08:19,562
using HTTP S or TLS within the app itself.

195
00:08:19,571 --> 00:08:22,201
And the operating system honestly doesn't care.

196
00:08:22,212 --> 00:08:23,441
And additionally, I mean,

197
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:27,582
just common practice has shown that trying to pretend that firewall

198
00:08:27,592 --> 00:08:30,411
-- is going to save you is stupid and doesn't work
-- well.

199
00:08:30,421 --> 00:08:30,802
I think it's even

200
00:08:30,907 --> 00:08:31,657
simpler than that.

201
00:08:31,697 --> 00:08:33,847
If I do my encryption at the application level,

202
00:08:33,857 --> 00:08:37,648
I can then say for sure this application has encryption and protection.

203
00:08:37,746 --> 00:08:41,447
Whereas if I'm relying on the underlying os to do encryption, yeah, maybe it does,

204
00:08:41,457 --> 00:08:42,187
maybe it doesn't,

205
00:08:42,317 --> 00:08:42,616
-- I
-- mean,

206
00:08:42,626 --> 00:08:45,497
I don't know, it probably doesn't because it's hard to set up. Right.

207
00:08:45,507 --> 00:08:46,047
Exactly.

208
00:08:46,218 --> 00:08:48,918
And especially in sort of cloud environments.

209
00:08:48,927 --> 00:08:51,848
For example, if I'm doing a platform as a service or something,

210
00:08:51,857 --> 00:08:54,107
can I even see what the underlying platform is doing?

211
00:08:54,138 --> 00:08:57,447
Like, how would you validate in a platform as a service situation that it

212
00:08:57,794 --> 00:08:58,354
is enabled?

213
00:08:58,364 --> 00:08:58,593
Well,

214
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:02,023
it's even harder than that because a favorite example

215
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:04,624
I have is if you're running on something like

216
00:09:04,934 --> 00:09:05,604
Kubernetes,

217
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:07,893
you're encrypting the traffic,

218
00:09:07,903 --> 00:09:11,044
essentially one or more layers above the container itself.

219
00:09:11,054 --> 00:09:13,304
So there's literally no way for the containers

220
00:09:13,314 --> 00:09:15,934
to even know there's encryption on the wire.

221
00:09:16,114 --> 00:09:16,484
Yeah,

222
00:09:16,893 --> 00:09:20,174
-- or what it is is a compliant
-- metaphorical wire. But

223
00:09:20,424 --> 00:09:24,093
so I, I predict that encryption will continue to move to the application

224
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,359
space and that's not to say that, you know, for example,

225
00:09:26,369 --> 00:09:29,840
people at Google won't like encrypt all their backhaul links just to be extra safe.

226
00:09:29,849 --> 00:09:31,219
-- I mean,
-- they, they did that.

227
00:09:31,229 --> 00:09:31,750
Yeah, they did.

228
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,260
But I'm saying,

229
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:36,419
but nobody will rely upon that or nobody with any sense will rely upon that.

230
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,500
Right?

231
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:42,919
And I, I agree with this and I would again counter this is not a prediction.

232
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:44,619
I, I have a feeling I know

233
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:48,099
where all of your predictions look like. And I'm going to save it to the end

234
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,739
to pontificate to you about it because

235
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:54,510
-- this is, this is interesting and special. What's happening here. All
-- right.

236
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,929
This is completely confirmation.

237
00:09:56,419 --> 00:09:57,630
All right. Next.

238
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,070
And I'm guessing the whole, you've heard about the whole cyber hygiene movement,

239
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,179
which I, I don't, does that, what does that mean?

240
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,030
Well, this whole idea that, you know, this, we've had this for, well,

241
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,679
it's been around for decades but

242
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,080
this idea that,

243
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:14,429
you know, people are going to do some certain baseline of activities so that

244
00:10:14,869 --> 00:10:17,770
they're not so insecure that it's embarrassing when they get hacked.

245
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:20,369
What is basically how I would put it to be blunt?

246
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:20,869
Well,

247
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,380
I was just watching a news report about this police

248
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,229
force that quote unquote got hacked and it was,

249
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:25,989
you know, it was ransomware.

250
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,130
And I was kind of wondering like, is a non target,

251
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,070
like when a ransomware escapes out into the wild,

252
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,450
like not pia is that actually hacking

253
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,539
you know, because we don't call somebody,

254
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:36,159
like somebody from a foreign country who comes over here

255
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:37,770
and sneezes all over the place at the airport.

256
00:10:37,849 --> 00:10:42,590
-- We don't call that like a biological attack.
-- It could be based upon intent.

257
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:45,940
Like if you injected yourself with some,

258
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:50,750
like let's say smallpox and then you start traveling the United States.

259
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,809
Yeah, that's a biological attack.

260
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,520
But I'm talking about the case where, you know, somebody makes some ransomware,

261
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,710
maybe targets one or two

262
00:10:56,849 --> 00:10:59,150
specific organizations.

263
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,710
And then of course, you know, being

264
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:05,030
how secure we are with the modern world that escapes out into the wild and rampages,

265
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:07,400
you know, does, if anybody here is old enough to remember the,

266
00:11:07,409 --> 00:11:11,169
I love you virus or the Melissa virus, I mean, those things went global and

267
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:15,330
well, back in the day it was days or hours now it's, you know, minutes, right.

268
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:19,250
And those things weren't meant to, you know, impact the entire world,

269
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:22,809
but the intent was nefarious from the get go.

270
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:25,210
It wasn't like this was an accident.

271
00:11:25,469 --> 00:11:30,570
They knew what it was going to do. They just didn't expect it to be as big as it was.

272
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,909
Yeah. So I think it's intense.

273
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:36,960
I think if it's ransomware and a bad guy releases it into the world

274
00:11:36,969 --> 00:11:41,299
and even if their target audience is meant to be small and it explodes.

275
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:44,789
Yeah, the, the intent was nefarious that's attacking.

276
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:49,229
So I'm guessing the best way for most organizations to deal with their cyber

277
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:53,830
hygiene is to outsource probably and to continue aggressively doing so because I,

278
00:11:53,859 --> 00:11:55,419
I still see so many.

279
00:11:55,429 --> 00:12:00,000
I was watching this channel and it's so weird to me. This guy does like server

280
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,299
level hardware review

281
00:12:02,909 --> 00:12:07,010
and he's building like a single machine with like two A MD Epic CP

282
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,099
US with like what is it like 6400 and 28 cores each whatever?

283
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:12,919
And he's really going on and on about this, my, my one thought was like,

284
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:16,179
and how do you even measure a Google container ships full of servers,

285
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:18,190
library of Congresses of servers,

286
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,820
football fields. I don't know. Right.

287
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,260
And,

288
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,950
and it was just so weird to me because he was going on and on about how this a MD

289
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,929
Epic server you can consolidate and he shows like three

290
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,710
racks that are like mostly empty now because they've been consolidated

291
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,619
into literally a two U machine

292
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,840
with like two big cats

293
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,969
use or like a pile of NVME storage.

294
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,020
And if you use the cloud, your rack is empty

295
00:12:38,669 --> 00:12:40,770
and somebody else actually maintains it for you.

296
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,070
But he was going on and on about your

297
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,609
choices of hypervisors and he actually went over one,

298
00:12:44,619 --> 00:12:46,690
an open source one that I've never heard of called

299
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,799
open container visual uh something virtualization or

300
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:52,210
something like I've never heard of it.

301
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:54,760
It's like a bare metal hypervisor thing anyways,

302
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:56,489
but it just got me thinking it was so

303
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:59,530
I I get that. Some companies and industries.

304
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:00,630
For example, if you're like,

305
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,809
if you're on like an oil platform in the middle of the ocean,

306
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,869
maybe your internet isn't good enough to have, you know, access to the cloud.

307
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,130
But I feel like for the majority of companies like

308
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,219
having on premises equipment just that needs to stop.

309
00:13:11,229 --> 00:13:15,130
-- Like, nobody generates their own electricity anymore.
-- No, no, they, well,

310
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:18,619
most, most places don't. Actually, there was so funny enough.

311
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,270
There was a factory in town

312
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,659
that up until last year

313
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,940
she had a coal, like a coal power plant on site

314
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,719
that and of course, we're like, guys, you got to like, quit burning F and coal.

315
00:13:29,729 --> 00:13:30,429
This is ridiculous.

316
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,010
Right. Seriously.

317
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:34,150
And it took a while but it's gone now.

318
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:34,650
But

319
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:39,539
I think there are niche use cases that we always want on prem.

320
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,400
But

321
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,030
it's kind of like email is the easiest poster child.

322
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,349
Are you hosting your own email? And maybe you are. Do you have a good reason to do it?

323
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:52,059
And like, for example, in the case of you and I like, no,

324
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:54,005
no, we don't have good reason to do that.

325
00:13:54,015 --> 00:13:56,344
And so we let someone else do it because they're quite

326
00:13:56,354 --> 00:13:59,854
-- frankly more competent and I'm too lazy to do it
-- just,

327
00:13:59,864 --> 00:14:00,934
and from a cost, like,

328
00:14:00,945 --> 00:14:04,364
I used to run my own email and even I had it down to one or two hours a week

329
00:14:04,534 --> 00:14:06,265
of managing spam and tweaking

330
00:14:07,565 --> 00:14:07,575
a

331
00:14:07,885 --> 00:14:07,934
week

332
00:14:09,234 --> 00:14:09,275
that's

333
00:14:09,594 --> 00:14:09,614
the

334
00:14:09,835 --> 00:14:09,864
goal.

335
00:14:10,974 --> 00:14:11,065
Uh

336
00:14:11,205 --> 00:14:14,784
Yes, I agree. I agree. And again, this is not a prediction.

337
00:14:14,945 --> 00:14:16,844
Alright, let's keep going. Let's do your next prediction.

338
00:14:17,294 --> 00:14:21,835
So, and this one is, I think really obvious because it's been so successful. But,

339
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,599
and because you were mocking this, actually the other day,

340
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:26,450
I love mocking things. It's

341
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,330
-- that whole
-- ecosystem marketplace idea.

342
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:31,919
And so we're not going to name the company.

343
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:35,130
But basically Josh showed me this site and you're like, I thought this was, you know,

344
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,159
satire at first.

345
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:37,729
And I'm like, no, it looks really cool

346
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:38,400
a

347
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:38,929
company

348
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,169
that has like a market.

349
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,030
-- Let's
-- call this out.

350
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:47,669
You can become a certified Slack engineer like Slack, the online chat platform

351
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:48,510
and

352
00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:52,020
we'll, we'll put a link in the show notes, but it's like Slack certified.com,

353
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,630
I think it is.

354
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,270
And I thought

355
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,599
it was a joke at first and I'm like, holy crap like this is the real deal,

356
00:14:56,609 --> 00:14:57,679
but here's the deal.

357
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:01,979
It's really well done, right? I, I will knock them because why not? It's Slack.

358
00:15:01,989 --> 00:15:04,700
But like for real, if you're gonna do certification,

359
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,320
like copy what these guys are up to.

360
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,479
-- It's really good.
-- Well, see, and that's something I've

361
00:15:08,849 --> 00:15:12,489
noticed is I've, I've used some integrations with other platforms and,

362
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,039
and they've been terrible.

363
00:15:14,049 --> 00:15:16,919
Like some of the early Gmail integration stuff was just

364
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:17,929
uh

365
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,650
you know, or some of the,

366
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:23,789
some of the early Google Drive integration stuff was just,

367
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:26,000
all right. Hold on. What's your prediction though?

368
00:15:26,539 --> 00:15:31,229
I suspect that this is what maturity looks like for a software company.

369
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,969
Uh, that's probably fair.

370
00:15:32,979 --> 00:15:37,010
And I think you could easily argue that slack is pretty mature.

371
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,130
I mean, they're basically running the world now

372
00:15:40,299 --> 00:15:40,440
and,

373
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,059
yeah, which is

374
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,640
kind of scary because they have a lot of,

375
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:45,549
you know,

376
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:50,460
I know it's Attackers. If you're looking for a target, I'm just saying.

377
00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:53,000
But, yeah. Yeah. No, I, I agree. I agree.

378
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,520
So I, and again, I mean, I, I'll be honest, I,

379
00:15:57,599 --> 00:16:00,340
I thought about having some really wild predictions but I mean, you know,

380
00:16:00,349 --> 00:16:01,549
I might as well be predicting like I

381
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:03,960
predict everyone will own a purple hippopotamus.

382
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,400
Uh They might so, ok, so here's

383
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:11,900
these all were exactly what I expected where you are just pointing out

384
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,179
obvious

385
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:17,440
minor changes to the things that are already happening now.

386
00:16:17,469 --> 00:16:20,799
And what you did was you took the coward's way out

387
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:23,989
of predicting the future because you didn't really predict the future.

388
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:27,419
You're just talking about things you know about and most people don't. Ok.

389
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,239
So

390
00:16:28,349 --> 00:16:31,780
here's my view on all of this and why I think

391
00:16:31,789 --> 00:16:34,900
trying to predict the future is never going to work.

392
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,710
And obviously using the word never is always a famous last word.

393
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:40,950
We have reached a point in security

394
00:16:41,369 --> 00:16:42,119
where

395
00:16:42,729 --> 00:16:47,159
the thing the changes we're seeing are incremental because we are,

396
00:16:47,169 --> 00:16:50,049
I hesitate to call us a maturing industry necessarily,

397
00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:54,710
but we are an industry that has bumped up against the ceiling of innovation,

398
00:16:54,869 --> 00:16:56,950
-- I think maybe ossified.
-- Yeah,

399
00:16:57,409 --> 00:16:58,570
maybe, I don't know,

400
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,020
ossified to turn into bone or bony tissue.

401
00:17:01,359 --> 00:17:04,750
Second definition to cease developing the stagnant or rigid.

402
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,069
-- I would say
-- I've never heard the second definition of it.

403
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,479
And that's where

404
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,380
ossified, I think applies here.

405
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,949
Maybe, I mean, but so either, either description you want to call it right?

406
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:15,020
But the point is

407
00:17:15,348 --> 00:17:17,088
we've reached a place

408
00:17:17,288 --> 00:17:18,128
where

409
00:17:18,428 --> 00:17:20,968
we aren't going to see massive innovation

410
00:17:21,188 --> 00:17:25,848
with the technology we have, we've basically reached, we will see

411
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:28,568
small incremental change. Now

412
00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:30,688
the industry needs

413
00:17:30,938 --> 00:17:35,178
new innovation. We need a disruptive technology to appear.

414
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:37,038
-- I think we
-- need multiple disruptive technology,

415
00:17:37,048 --> 00:17:38,678
probably more than one. I agree.

416
00:17:38,688 --> 00:17:42,328
But the point is we, we definitely need disruption at this point. And

417
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,739
the problem is it is virtually impossible to predict disruption.

418
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,290
It's just the nature of disruption because if it, if it was predictable,

419
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,420
you wouldn't call it disruption.

420
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:52,410
Well, I mean, if you,

421
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,780
you basically would have to make enough

422
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,410
predictions to cover everything and be like,

423
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,180
-- see I said it would happen,
-- which is equally ridiculous.

424
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,939
And I think given what we have the idea

425
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:04,199
because instead of expecting massive change,

426
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:06,560
we have to kind of accept the reality we have,

427
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:08,369
which I think a lot of people still haven't done

428
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,599
because you still get into arguments with people saying,

429
00:18:10,609 --> 00:18:12,420
oh, we'll just train everyone to not move

430
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:17,119
and it's like no you won't because if you could, we would have done that a decade ago.

431
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,140
So we're going to see this incremental change and things are going to,

432
00:18:21,609 --> 00:18:22,890
I won't say get better

433
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:27,150
because the bad guys also have incremental change. And

434
00:18:27,469 --> 00:18:30,270
in some cases like ransomware was their disruption.

435
00:18:30,369 --> 00:18:32,400
And then what was our solution to ransomware?

436
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,150
Like thoughts and prayers pretty much.

437
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,010
And that's my favorite from that,

438
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,969
that article with the police department that got ransomware is like,

439
00:18:38,979 --> 00:18:41,949
then we talked to our T people and they advised us to pay the ransom

440
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,819
and,

441
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:49,199
-- yeah. Right. Anyway,
-- I think, and I think it's actually worse than that.

442
00:18:49,209 --> 00:18:53,709
We need innovation at the technological level. I think we need innovation at

443
00:18:54,219 --> 00:18:58,699
not just the legal level but at the sort of societal expectations level

444
00:18:59,219 --> 00:19:01,619
because quite frankly, as long as people are ok with

445
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:03,689
all this stuff getting hacked and

446
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,979
whatever,

447
00:19:05,189 --> 00:19:09,260
you know, as long as it's an external cost for most companies, why

448
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,160
would I spend money on fixing it?

449
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,660
Right. Absolutely.

450
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:16,010
And this is where things like GDPR are meant to rein

451
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:19,239
some of the costs back into the organizations holding your data.

452
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,500
I mean, we'll see if it really matters.

453
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:25,400
There's actually a good website showing GDPR fines. But the reality of it is

454
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:30,040
last I checked, there's still huge numbers of data breaches and,

455
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,900
you know, the, I mean, the, the,

456
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,880
the cookie click through on every website now just makes

457
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,819
me weak because I suspect that actually probably has a,

458
00:19:38,829 --> 00:19:42,040
a carbon footprint equivalent to some small country,

459
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,400
forcing people to look at that and click it and like, waste a second of their day.

460
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:52,209
Well, and I think that the place where GDPR might have fallen short is again,

461
00:19:52,219 --> 00:19:55,469
you know, in the legal framework there is the concept of intent

462
00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:57,790
and as long as you're not willfully malicious,

463
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,790
your GDPR fine isn't going to be that crazy and let's face it.

464
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,829
Nobody's willfully malicious. Right.

465
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,430
It's just the fact that like,

466
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:07,209
you suck at what you're doing and you let everyone's

467
00:20:07,219 --> 00:20:09,750
data escape and yet you had some controls in place,

468
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,619
but they weren't enough and your, it people don't know what's going on.

469
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:15,530
And so they're like, oh, well, here have a cookie. It's ok.

470
00:20:15,609 --> 00:20:16,900
Whereas they should be like, no,

471
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:20,819
no, no, like here's the minimum fine. You screwed up, pay it.

472
00:20:20,829 --> 00:20:23,699
Here's an interesting thing. So I'm looking at the GDPR fine amounts.

473
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,910
There's a couple of big ones.

474
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:30,010
-- Uh, 50 million for Google, €50 million for Google, which is
-- zero for Google.

475
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:33,380
Yeah, basically 99 million pounds for Marriott International

476
00:20:33,489 --> 00:20:36,170
and 100 and 83 million pounds for British Airways.

477
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,900
But then it basically, it drops off to like,

478
00:20:39,089 --> 00:20:41,310
and, and then there's one internet provider,

479
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:43,959
one on one got dinged for just under €10 million.

480
00:20:43,969 --> 00:20:47,949
But then it basically, there's a couple of like 100,000 ones and then it just drops,

481
00:20:49,459 --> 00:20:50,800
it's going to be long tail.

482
00:20:51,069 --> 00:20:54,739
Well, no, not really a long tail because there's only about 50 or 60 of these.

483
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:58,939
-- Oh, really? Wow. I would expect more.
-- There's not been a lot of GDPR fines.

484
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,050
And what's interesting is when you read them like there, for example,

485
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,920
this one unnamed medical company not appointing ad po not publishing

486
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,040
its contact details or reporting those to the supervisory authority,

487
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,760
obligatory consent of data subjects,

488
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:12,339
blah, blah, blah. I feel like there's a lot of

489
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:13,989
companies are doing that.

490
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,640
Probably, I also have a suspicion.

491
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:21,050
The GDPR regulators probably don't have the bandwidth to process everything.

492
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,349
So they're going to try to pick out big ones. It's probably like speeding,

493
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:24,869
right?

494
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,660
You know, they don't pull over everyone's speeding,

495
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:29,030
they just try to get the worst offenders and that's

496
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,989
the hope that people will play it nice anyway,

497
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,069
back to the

498
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,630
the concept of predictions.

499
00:21:35,979 --> 00:21:39,630
I just don't think in our space we can make predictions.

500
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,959
It's kind of like, you know what

501
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:45,040
I would say, if you think about what would a prediction look like in,

502
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:48,000
let's say the building industry today where you've

503
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:52,439
got traditional style building using wood or stone

504
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,010
and then all the stuff that goes in it.

505
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,729
And now there's obviously things like 3D printed houses

506
00:21:57,739 --> 00:22:00,489
that are kind of becoming a hip new idea.

507
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,810
And I actually saw some pictures on,

508
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:05,530
on Twitter the other day showing off like a 3D printed house and

509
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:09,510
like that's new and interesting and it has the potential to be disruptive,

510
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,650
but I wouldn't say it is disruptive today.

511
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,329
And

512
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,670
would I predict that's going to take over? No, I would not.

513
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,140
Technology takes just because you have working technology,

514
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:23,760
you have to make it acceptable to the mass market, bring the cost down, make it work.

515
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,209
And that stuff is hard.

516
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:25,719
Like

517
00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:29,239
only anybody can build a rocket but,

518
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:33,760
-- you know, try building 10 or 20 rockets but work reliably,
-- that's fair.

519
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:38,050
I would not get inside of a rocket you built under any circumstances.

520
00:22:38,469 --> 00:22:40,199
I wouldn't even go near the launch pad.

521
00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:42,540
Right. Yes. Exactly. Exactly.

522
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:45,819
Yeah, actually, so I was listening to the radio last night

523
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:50,479
and they were talking about Boeing is going to suspend production of the 737

524
00:22:50,489 --> 00:22:52,609
max aircraft because obviously they're all still

525
00:22:52,619 --> 00:22:54,449
grounded at the time of this recording.

526
00:22:54,459 --> 00:22:57,420
And like Boeing has a ton of them in a parking lot.

527
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,270
Basically that they don't know what to do with.

528
00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:01,329
And they were talking about how these

529
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:05,729
aircraft are hopefully will be cleared for flight

530
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:10,250
in the beginning of next year, next year being 2020 at the time of recording.

531
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,520
Well, it should be 20 this will be published in 2019. But anyway,

532
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:14,959
and, but then they said,

533
00:23:14,969 --> 00:23:16,920
but the problem becomes what are airlines

534
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,869
gonna tell the passengers everything's fine,

535
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,630
trust us.

536
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,030
Like would you get on a 737

537
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,380
in the beginning of the year.

538
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:28,280
-- Well, I don't know. I think
-- about it. I would prefer not to.

539
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:29,280
Right. Exactly.

540
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:33,359
-- But at the same time, do I realistically have a choice? Uh,
-- you might not.

541
00:23:33,369 --> 00:23:38,839
And I won't lie if I had to go somewhere and the only aircraft available is a 737 max,

542
00:23:38,849 --> 00:23:41,829
I'd probably get on it and just be like, well, that was neat.

543
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:44,359
But, and the reality is, it's probably going to be fine,

544
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,119
but at the same time

545
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,319
the general public is going to see that and be like, no,

546
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:53,750
statistically it will be fine, but it's not fine if you own one that crashes.

547
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,130
But

548
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:57,469
stat, I mean, that could be true of any flight.

549
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,579
Well, you know, it's like my feelings about air carriers in general.

550
00:23:59,589 --> 00:24:01,089
If you look at their safety track records,

551
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:04,599
like for North America and the Western Europe and whatnot, it's, it's fine

552
00:24:04,713 --> 00:24:04,753
as

553
00:24:04,873 --> 00:24:08,322
most of, you know, the developed Asia is great and then it starts to drop and by,

554
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:13,012
you know, if, if you go to the poor countries, like, it goes off a cliff real fast.

555
00:24:13,022 --> 00:24:15,463
Sure. Sure. Yeah, I don't know. That's a good question.

556
00:24:15,473 --> 00:24:17,572
Would I fly in a 737 max if I have to, you know,

557
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,603
fly to Vancouver hour and 14 minute flight?

558
00:24:19,613 --> 00:24:22,733
Because westjet uses, I forget if they have Maxes or not. Yeah. I don't know.

559
00:24:22,963 --> 00:24:24,652
I, the reality is, I mean, you,

560
00:24:24,765 --> 00:24:26,845
I was still more likely to die on the way to the airport,

561
00:24:26,855 --> 00:24:28,265
like on the drive to the airport

562
00:24:28,586 --> 00:24:30,546
-- and
-- you know, it would make me feel better,

563
00:24:30,556 --> 00:24:33,225
but I suspect I'm in the vast minority here

564
00:24:33,235 --> 00:24:35,225
put a Boeing executive on every single flight.

565
00:24:35,235 --> 00:24:35,745
No, no,

566
00:24:35,755 --> 00:24:38,076
I would feel better just reading the FAA S

567
00:24:38,086 --> 00:24:41,475
report and if the FAA explains what happened,

568
00:24:41,485 --> 00:24:44,735
what Boeing did to fix it and this is why everything's going to be ok.

569
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,729
-- I would probably accept that. The
-- problem is it's worse than that.

570
00:24:47,739 --> 00:24:51,349
It's not just a technical failure there. The FAA allowed Boeing to self certify.

571
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:53,530
Boeing wanted to self certify because apparently

572
00:24:53,739 --> 00:24:54,869
the deal was, they, they,

573
00:24:55,209 --> 00:24:58,630
the 737 max is technically a 737, but

574
00:24:58,770 --> 00:24:59,699
really it's not.

575
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,359
And, but the main thing is this, the,

576
00:25:01,479 --> 00:25:03,380
the pilots don't have to get a new, what is it called,

577
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:04,630
a flight certificate or whatever?

578
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,140
Right. So, like you have to get rated, like you can't just, like, learn to draw.

579
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,550
Well, it's the same thing with cars. Right.

580
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,569
I have a class five vehicle license in Alberta, which means I can drive like,

581
00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:14,260
you know, reasonably sized cars.

582
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:17,660
But if I'm in a semi truck, well, number one, that's assuming I can even get it moving,

583
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:19,650
but let's assume I get it moving and I get pulled over,

584
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:22,560
I'm going to be in all kinds of trouble because I don't have a class one license.

585
00:25:22,829 --> 00:25:26,189
And so what worries me is why do we think

586
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:28,709
the 737 max is the only plane with this problem.

587
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:30,300
And by problem, I mean, don't,

588
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,150
I don't mean this specific technical problem but I mean,

589
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,880
this general problem of they push the design to the limit

590
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,750
to keep it quote unquote, the same flight certificate.

591
00:25:37,849 --> 00:25:42,290
-- You know,
-- I haven't seen any research into that question, but that is a very,

592
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:46,410
-- very good question
-- because the 737 1st came out in,

593
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:52,380
-- oh, it's like the seventies or sixties, it's old.
-- First flight was in 1967. So it was

594
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:54,219
design. So, I mean, that's

595
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,079
right.

596
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:59,750
It's needless to say the plane they're flying today is not the

597
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,479
plane they were flying in the sixties back when computers weren't real.

598
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:10,530
So anyway, we are nearing the end of our time

599
00:26:10,689 --> 00:26:12,219
and I feel like

600
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:17,930
again, we will see countless predictions about security in 2020

601
00:26:18,329 --> 00:26:22,520
it's probably going to run the gamut of every possible thing you can imagine.

602
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,540
Some of them will be right. Some of them will be wrong.

603
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,199
There's gonna be ransomware. Maybe there will be a big worm attack.

604
00:26:28,239 --> 00:26:30,569
There's probably gonna be iot problems.

605
00:26:30,579 --> 00:26:35,219
I bet there's gonna be two or more intel CPU timing attacks.

606
00:26:35,229 --> 00:26:39,150
It won't shock me if we see some A MD timing attacks because they're like,

607
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,439
they have the same problems.

608
00:26:40,449 --> 00:26:42,689
It's gonna happen when the researchers look.

609
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,109
It's like more of the same man.

610
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:49,430
Like that's the prediction for 2020 2020 is gonna look just like 2019.

611
00:26:49,449 --> 00:26:52,040
Maybe with the knob turned up a little tiny bit.

612
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:55,630
-- So there's just a little bit more crazy, but that's it.
-- Well, here's a thought.

613
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,469
When do you think the A IML boom will end in security

614
00:26:58,729 --> 00:26:59,310
will end?

615
00:26:59,675 --> 00:27:02,025
Well, you know, before, like, because remember when, you know,

616
00:27:02,035 --> 00:27:05,055
I DS and ID P and all that stuff was the hot stuff and now it's like,

617
00:27:05,064 --> 00:27:07,645
-- whatever it's people do it sometimes they don't,
-- whatever.

618
00:27:07,655 --> 00:27:11,885
It's gonna be the same slow burn where it was, the hype curve was huge.

619
00:27:11,895 --> 00:27:15,005
And we're like, oh my goodness, it's gonna change everything and now we're like, eh,

620
00:27:15,015 --> 00:27:15,755
whatever

621
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,660
and it'll just slowly get better.

622
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,349
And then one day we're going to wake up and be like,

623
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:23,949
when did this robot steal my job and move into my house and teach my kids?

624
00:27:23,969 --> 00:27:25,869
And I think that's what it's gonna be.

625
00:27:26,329 --> 00:27:30,439
It's like every new technology, it follows that crazy hype curve. Right. Holy cow.

626
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:31,790
This is gonna change everything.

627
00:27:31,939 --> 00:27:32,829
And here's the thing,

628
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:35,660
some disruptive technology does change everything.

629
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:38,430
The smartphone changed everything like the hype curve.

630
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:43,520
It was crazy except, oh wait, we're just gonna keep going up because it's awesome.

631
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,369
But

632
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:48,689
you look at like A I and ML and they were hugely oversold and they under delivered.

633
00:27:48,699 --> 00:27:52,290
So now it's just going to be that slow burn until they reach a point of usefulness,

634
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,369
which they will someday.

635
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,010
But I don't think it'll be next year.

636
00:27:55,219 --> 00:27:58,170
I would argue that they've already reached a point of usefulness.

637
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:01,650
Oh, they have value. Just not the value we were promised.

638
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,130
All right. Now, I have a good question for you.

639
00:28:04,339 --> 00:28:07,959
Self driving cars. Do you think we will see a fully autonomous

640
00:28:08,204 --> 00:28:11,555
trip from one end of the United States to the other?

641
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,125
-- Didn't they already
-- do that with butter? No,

642
00:28:13,135 --> 00:28:13,984
I mean, like a real one.

643
00:28:13,994 --> 00:28:16,064
-- Not like they're fake on the highway. It
-- was

644
00:28:16,074 --> 00:28:17,275
-- a
-- semi truck full of butter,

645
00:28:17,545 --> 00:28:20,675
did they? No, was it? No, no, I don't mean a semi truck full of butter.

646
00:28:20,685 --> 00:28:27,484
I want to see a, like a, a Tesla, a vehicle a, a normal consumer can acquire, right?

647
00:28:27,494 --> 00:28:31,204
Not like some contrived test or something like it will be contrived.

648
00:28:31,214 --> 00:28:32,234
But you know what I mean? I'm saying? Like

649
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,969
I want to know when will a,

650
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:36,859
a vehicle a human can buy you or I could go and purchase

651
00:28:36,869 --> 00:28:41,380
now will make a successful autonomous trip from one end to the other.

652
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,489
Do you think it'll be next year?

653
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:46,569
Uh Well, people already have claimed to make it back in 2018. Really?

654
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,130
Ok. Then I guess sure.

655
00:28:48,709 --> 00:28:50,239
Now here's, here's one thing. So self

656
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,130
driving cars because you brought this up.

657
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,660
I was reading an article talking about how Mercedes engineers

658
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:57,430
have made the decision that the Mercedes car will essentially.

659
00:28:57,579 --> 00:29:00,030
Ok. I'm going to make a statement. You tell me what's wrong with the statement?

660
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:03,689
The Mercedes will choose to protect the driver of the car.

661
00:29:03,699 --> 00:29:05,270
Like in a self driving car scenario,

662
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,270
it will choose to protect the driver of the car in the event of an accident.

663
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,900
So for example, it might run over some pedestrians.

664
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,020
-- What is wrong with that
-- statement?

665
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:14,270
-- I I saw that there's nothing wrong with that statement
-- because if no,

666
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,237
there is why are we using the word driver?

667
00:29:16,347 --> 00:29:20,126
-- Well, the the the occupants of the vehicle I think is what they actually mean.
-- See,

668
00:29:20,227 --> 00:29:21,607
now, let me ask you a second question.

669
00:29:21,616 --> 00:29:25,597
The taxi driver of a taxi with or without passengers

670
00:29:25,837 --> 00:29:27,406
will most likely choose

671
00:29:27,577 --> 00:29:29,916
to protect themselves rather than for example,

672
00:29:29,927 --> 00:29:32,317
veering into certain death to avoid running over a pedestrian.

673
00:29:32,327 --> 00:29:36,016
-- Now all of a sudden we're much more ok with that sentence, are
-- we, I mean,

674
00:29:36,026 --> 00:29:38,796
I think there are some that might, there's some who won't.

675
00:29:38,807 --> 00:29:41,327
I think humans are unpredictable in those situations.

676
00:29:41,593 --> 00:29:44,543
But compared to making that statement for an autonomous self driving car,

677
00:29:44,553 --> 00:29:46,284
here's what I will say about that.

678
00:29:46,293 --> 00:29:50,223
I read that and I've thought about it a lot and we won't

679
00:29:50,234 --> 00:29:53,264
talk about it in depth because I think it's a bag of snakes.

680
00:29:53,274 --> 00:29:56,614
But fundamentally, if you want to sell cars,

681
00:29:56,813 --> 00:29:58,173
you don't want to be like, oh,

682
00:29:58,183 --> 00:29:59,943
and by the way the car is going to

683
00:29:59,953 --> 00:30:03,364
kill you if you're in an ethically questionable situation,

684
00:30:03,374 --> 00:30:03,624
right?

685
00:30:03,634 --> 00:30:05,514
And be like, no, I'm not buying that car.

686
00:30:05,524 --> 00:30:07,654
I'm going to buy the car over there that promises to kill the

687
00:30:08,071 --> 00:30:08,860
instead of me.

688
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,090
Right. I think it's a business decision

689
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,661
whether you agree with it or not.

690
00:30:12,671 --> 00:30:14,510
-- I understand why they did it
-- and it's already

691
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,441
a decision we've made and accepted with humans.

692
00:30:16,451 --> 00:30:18,260
Right. Humans do dumb stuff all the time

693
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:22,090
driving into people or other cars or other objects to try and save themselves.

694
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:26,730
I think it's unpredictable though because I think some humans will make a conscious

695
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:30,561
decision to put themselves in harm's way instead of harming a group of people.

696
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:34,000
Some people won't make a conscious decision because they're incapable of doing it.

697
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:35,531
And some people will say,

698
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:39,109
-- you know, I'm running them over because I'm saving me.
-- Well, let me put it this way.

699
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:40,270
If we really cared about that,

700
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,400
then why aren't the penalties for drunk driving so much harsher?

701
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,540
That's fair.

702
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,150
Like I said,

703
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,140
we've already accepted that people will easily put themselves in

704
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,229
a situation where they will easily choose themselves or,

705
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:53,239
or create a scenario that is so full of risk.

706
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,949
It's, you know, it's so full of risk. We've decided that it's illegal.

707
00:30:55,959 --> 00:30:58,380
We're veering into a

708
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,989
dark place

709
00:31:00,449 --> 00:31:05,319
and I'm gonna stop us because we're out of time and I don't want to talk about that.

710
00:31:05,329 --> 00:31:07,069
I'll answer your question though. I predict

711
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:10,750
probably not next year.

712
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:15,439
Uh, not in 2020. That is, but probably I'm guessing early to mid 2021

713
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,910
is when we'll see, for example,

714
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,760
something like Tesla have enough software upgrades to be able to

715
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:23,589
essentially let's use the Cannonball run as an example. Right.

716
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:26,239
You drive from, what is it New York to L A as fast as you can

717
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:31,640
for, I think another year, year and a half. And I feel like a car like

718
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,380
Tesla or something would be able to make

719
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:36,250
that Cannonball run probably without killing anybody.

720
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:39,770
Yeah, that seems fair. But I feel like it's sooner than we think.

721
00:31:39,849 --> 00:31:43,369
I hope so because I, I'm gonna need a new car in like a year or two.

722
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:47,089
And I really would like to buy a self driving vehicle because I hate driving.

723
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:47,729
So

724
00:31:48,099 --> 00:31:51,359
here's hoping crossing my fingers. All right. Anyway, we need to end this.

725
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:52,599
