Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,420
Kurt Siefried and my partner in appreciating silence.

2
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,180
-- Josh Pressers.
-- Oh, my goodness. Did we, did we talk about silence

3
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:16,540
for two minutes?

4
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,459
No, no, no. I mean, in what was it? Two or three episodes ago?

5
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:21,260
Because we talked about the hiss,

6
00:00:21,409 --> 00:00:22,819
the, not the hiss, the

7
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,889
-- Yeah. Yeah.
-- Yeah. Yeah. The high pitched wine from your

8
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,459
-- led,
-- the high pitched noise that we can't hear that I took out.

9
00:00:29,045 --> 00:00:30,975
And now before

10
00:00:31,246 --> 00:00:33,945
so I, I have a checklist for, for anyone who doesn't know,

11
00:00:33,956 --> 00:00:36,585
like when we record the podcast, I have a checklist.

12
00:00:36,596 --> 00:00:38,756
I go through to make sure I don't forget to do

13
00:00:38,765 --> 00:00:41,866
something prior to recording because I used to always forget things

14
00:00:41,986 --> 00:00:46,035
-- and I added an item that says record.
-- It's weird how checklists work. Right.

15
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:46,596
Exactly.

16
00:00:46,605 --> 00:00:50,506
And I, I just added a thing recently that says record five seconds of silence.

17
00:00:50,515 --> 00:00:51,305
And then I'm going to,

18
00:00:51,316 --> 00:00:53,801
I can use that silence from Kurt and I then to remove

19
00:00:53,812 --> 00:00:57,742
any possible background noise from fans or any other weird things happening so

20
00:00:58,032 --> 00:00:59,582
well and get the right silence.

21
00:00:59,801 --> 00:01:01,951
That's true. I've become obsessed with silence.

22
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:05,711
This sounds like, uh, I sound like a crazy person when I talk to people now, but like

23
00:01:05,912 --> 00:01:08,272
there's a really good Reddit thread on this, you know.

24
00:01:08,321 --> 00:01:12,472
Anyway, also with respect to checklist, go, if you haven't bought it in Reddit,

25
00:01:12,482 --> 00:01:14,902
go get the checklist Manifesto from Atul

26
00:01:15,232 --> 00:01:15,991
Gowanda.

27
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,980
I probably butchered that name.

28
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,099
But yeah, please go get that book and read it.

29
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,440
Do yourself a favor. It's, it's worth it.

30
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,470
So,

31
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,779
but sort of in line with this today is

32
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,010
sort of a hodgepodge of things that are all linked together ultimately.

33
00:01:29,059 --> 00:01:33,080
And it sort of started out with open source, doesn't require providing bills.

34
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:33,980
So

35
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,779
you sent this to me and I read it and I was like,

36
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:39,059
and

37
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:40,580
well, it's,

38
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,800
but you, I come from a time when open sources didn't provide builds,

39
00:01:45,809 --> 00:01:47,949
we had to build it ourselves.

40
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:51,959
And so a couple of things, number one, this is talking about providing builds,

41
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:55,040
not actually, for example, doing bills internally testing them and then

42
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,949
not releasing them, for example.

43
00:01:57,099 --> 00:01:57,800
And for example,

44
00:01:57,809 --> 00:02:00,819
this is one of the things that really like some of the B sds

45
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,680
like net BS D is infamous for running on everything from a toaster to

46
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,160
everything.

47
00:02:05,449 --> 00:02:06,669
Um And so, you know,

48
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,559
they have a whole bunch of people with weird old strange whatever hardware

49
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:13,029
and sort of one advantage of actually building the stuff and testing it is

50
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,899
there are bugs that only bubble up on big Indian versus little Indian systems.

51
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,350
That is true.

52
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:21,949
Another thing is to put it bluntly if you write source

53
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,789
code that has to be compiled and maybe you don't like,

54
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,580
maybe like me or a Python person.

55
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:27,860
And so this whole argument is like, you can just,

56
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,580
you can just skip to the end and have a grilled cheese sandwich.

57
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,830
But if you are actually working with a language that needs to be compiled, you know,

58
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:37,089
to run it and to really test it and whatever or

59
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,169
to ship it.

60
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:42,990
I feel like I like certain types of software.

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,710
You absolutely have to do this to get anybody to download it and use it.

62
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,110
I mean, sure, sure.

63
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,949
And other pieces of software you don't because

64
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:51,250
like like said

65
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:52,979
knock right, R and C

66
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,110
and completely the disres will compile them and

67
00:02:56,119 --> 00:02:58,190
ship them as part of their default tool chain

68
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,149
100%.

69
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,205
But when you start looking at sort of higher level software that

70
00:03:02,214 --> 00:03:04,964
maybe how do I put this nicely that normal people use?

71
00:03:05,294 --> 00:03:07,544
Yeah, normal people don't want to compile this and fight with it.

72
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:10,485
They just want to download a binary onto Windows or Mac or

73
00:03:11,054 --> 00:03:12,395
the 1% of them onto Linux.

74
00:03:12,794 --> 00:03:15,125
I have a great example. Great example.

75
00:03:15,464 --> 00:03:17,365
If you're a Kubernetes user,

76
00:03:17,505 --> 00:03:20,535
the like client is KCTL,

77
00:03:20,654 --> 00:03:20,964
right?

78
00:03:22,065 --> 00:03:23,695
And the install instructions for

79
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:28,115
CCTL are basically download this thing off the internet and put it in user local bin.

80
00:03:28,565 --> 00:03:28,875
Yeah,

81
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:29,645
like,

82
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:31,770
yeah, those are the instructions.

83
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:34,649
I'm curious. Does it include an internal upgrader?

84
00:03:35,059 --> 00:03:37,570
Because that's another thing I'm seeing more commonly now is

85
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,940
-- no,
-- you have to upgrade it, it, it on your own.

86
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:41,970
Oh, ok. Interesting.

87
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:45,570
-- It doesn't magically
-- upgrade. I've noticed a lot of programs internally

88
00:03:45,675 --> 00:03:46,794
shipping with an update or,

89
00:03:47,354 --> 00:03:48,184
you know, like

90
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:49,475
web browsers.

91
00:03:49,494 --> 00:03:52,315
The are one of the original example of that where that really caught on.

92
00:03:52,324 --> 00:03:55,315
Well, web browsers are special web browsers don't count.

93
00:03:55,404 --> 00:03:57,255
They're, they're, you're their own beast,

94
00:03:57,664 --> 00:03:59,134
but there's lots of stuff. But anyway,

95
00:03:59,464 --> 00:04:01,175
I don't know what to say to this. Like

96
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:05,509
part of me thinks duh. But at the same time, another part of me says

97
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:09,050
there's a generation of computer users

98
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:13,679
that are used to projects, just publishing binaries. And I think there's

99
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,750
a bunch of reasons this happened.

100
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,010
One is

101
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,839
in many instances,

102
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,839
your users can't build your software and a distribution won't include it.

103
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:23,350
Like

104
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:24,920
Coop CTL is a great example.

105
00:04:24,929 --> 00:04:27,959
So the last time I was working with Kubernetes, this is like a week or two ago.

106
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,209
Yeah. How is that? Not

107
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:29,529
by

108
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:30,190
distro,

109
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:30,399
you

110
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:30,609
think?

111
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,209
No, no, no. It is. It is

112
00:04:32,725 --> 00:04:34,545
my Debian machine in the basement

113
00:04:34,684 --> 00:04:36,595
is what I'm running Kuber

114
00:04:36,725 --> 00:04:37,714
neti stuff on, right?

115
00:04:39,024 --> 00:04:44,274
I install KCTL from Debian and it is like years out of date

116
00:04:45,174 --> 00:04:47,154
and KCTL releases

117
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,619
quite often.

118
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:52,339
-- So I had no choice.
-- That's one thing that drives me nuts

119
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:54,480
and, and well, and that's a perfect example too.

120
00:04:54,489 --> 00:04:58,220
Of like, I want my software up to date for free from a bunch of volunteers,

121
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,339
repackaging it,

122
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,179
work faster

123
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,850
and then, and then things get really ugly where, you know,

124
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,899
the, let's call it the vendor,

125
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,670
the original source provider project, whatever you wanna call it

126
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:15,190
is like, OK, we'll make a binary but we only want to like make a binary for Linux.

127
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,589
So we're gonna ship in a flat pack or some other

128
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,709
or a docker container or something.

129
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:22,619
And then of course, everybody gets angry at them for not giving them more choices.

130
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,279
And it's kind of like

131
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,230
whatever.

132
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:27,190
I've seen people complaining that like, oh you provide this in flat pack.

133
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,429
Flatpack is the devil's

134
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:32,950
Kale lettuce, whatever. I don't know. A lot of people really hate Flatpack.

135
00:05:33,049 --> 00:05:34,970
-- It's simple for me. I hate all
-- of

136
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,149
it.

137
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,920
I hate software.

138
00:05:37,049 --> 00:05:37,679
I don't like

139
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:38,200
it. I

140
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:38,899
just,

141
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:42,519
-- all of it.
-- It's like every time somebody starts complaining about R PM or

142
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:42,970
dack

143
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,359
or something, I'm like, yep.

144
00:05:44,369 --> 00:05:46,679
And, and here's the problems with M SI and here's the problems with

145
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,529
-- this.
-- Everything is terrible. That's all it's

146
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,339
for sure.

147
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,609
So, so anyway,

148
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,179
I

149
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,309
wanna, I wanna bring up one more thing.

150
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,730
I think that makes it an interesting story about the build. Like providing builds.

151
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:02,130
I think historically speaking,

152
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,769
providing builds was tough because you have to get the software,

153
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:07,410
build it and then upload it somewhere.

154
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,970
Dude, you had to build a CD N

155
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:12,089
uh No, no, no, not that. Well, that's part of it.

156
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,500
Right. And now with things like github,

157
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,290
github

158
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:20,390
can build and publish your binary magically. And I suspect that's part of it as well.

159
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,390
Well, it's, it's like everything we've leveled up the world.

160
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:26,179
You know, we used to buy cars without air conditioning or seatbelts.

161
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,880
Good luck trying to sell a car in the North American

162
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,809
market or most of the world without seatbelts or air conditioning.

163
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,029
I don't think you can legally sell it without seatbelts and

164
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:35,920
yeah,

165
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:37,989
I wouldn't want a car without air

166
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,489
conditioning because the summers get pretty rough.

167
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,769
So part of it is everything has leveled up. Like, for example, people expect

168
00:06:45,179 --> 00:06:49,989
the software to mostly work. I remember downloading like versions of Bind and DH CP

169
00:06:50,105 --> 00:06:51,045
having to hand

170
00:06:51,216 --> 00:06:53,765
patch them for known vulnerabilities that they hadn't

171
00:06:53,895 --> 00:06:56,925
or known problems that they hadn't yet fixed.

172
00:06:56,936 --> 00:06:59,295
Let's not dwell on the past because it's gonna get boring.

173
00:06:59,305 --> 00:07:00,765
We got a lot more stories here.

174
00:07:00,776 --> 00:07:04,705
The thing is, things have leveled up but not everybody has gone with it.

175
00:07:05,126 --> 00:07:06,105
Right. Some people

176
00:07:06,406 --> 00:07:06,585
who,

177
00:07:06,776 --> 00:07:10,536
why everybody not providing binaries for their stuff, by definition,

178
00:07:10,545 --> 00:07:11,265
to some degree.

179
00:07:11,276 --> 00:07:13,246
I feel like it's pretty common now.

180
00:07:13,462 --> 00:07:14,441
Well, and some of, well, yeah,

181
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:16,721
but there are still people who don't provide binaries and, you know,

182
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:19,321
people ask why not and they're like, well, too much work or, and I,

183
00:07:19,332 --> 00:07:21,011
I can't help but wonder maybe it's,

184
00:07:21,182 --> 00:07:22,721
they don't know that it's easier now

185
00:07:23,011 --> 00:07:25,891
-- or they just don't want to, which is
-- fair. This is the whole open

186
00:07:26,062 --> 00:07:28,851
source owes you nothing story. Right? Like if you're an open

187
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:30,872
source project and you don't want to provide Binaries

188
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:31,721
good job.

189
00:07:32,381 --> 00:07:32,802
Well,

190
00:07:32,812 --> 00:07:34,541
the flip side being though is that there's that

191
00:07:34,552 --> 00:07:36,272
fine line of open source owes you nothing.

192
00:07:36,282 --> 00:07:36,522
But

193
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,929
I feel like open source should try to play nice with others and allow people

194
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,619
to come in and maybe help out like if somebody does want to build binaries,

195
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,100
-- maybe let them
-- uh maybe, yeah, I'm fine with that.

196
00:07:46,109 --> 00:07:46,450
I mean,

197
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:49,070
and I get every single here's what I'm just gonna say,

198
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:51,049
every single one of these is totally different and

199
00:07:51,059 --> 00:07:54,089
it is going to involve some form of negotiation and

200
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,570
compromise and whatever.

201
00:07:55,704 --> 00:07:58,845
It's complicated. In other words, what really gets me is that

202
00:07:59,135 --> 00:08:01,605
as we kind of level up, what is possible?

203
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:05,105
Like everybody expects you to have a public get repo now,

204
00:08:05,114 --> 00:08:06,845
that was not always the case.

205
00:08:07,584 --> 00:08:07,595
Uh

206
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,725
access to source code

207
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:13,915
with a lot of stuff is still like we publish a tar ball once in a while.

208
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,760
-- That's it. Like
-- I, I don't think that's very common anymore.

209
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:21,649
Well, there's a few but it used to be the default mostly.

210
00:08:21,859 --> 00:08:24,019
Yeah. Yeah, because we didn't, it didn't exist

211
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:24,679
because

212
00:08:24,809 --> 00:08:28,029
if you published, if you had a public source code repo,

213
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,480
you know, three people would try and check it out and it would crash

214
00:08:30,855 --> 00:08:31,345
right because

215
00:08:32,183 --> 00:08:35,155
that's true because it was CV S and CV S was terrible.

216
00:08:35,455 --> 00:08:38,244
I remember running that thing on a machine with eight megs of ra M and I was like,

217
00:08:38,255 --> 00:08:39,705
-- all right,
-- I'm gonna, I'm gonna move this on.

218
00:08:39,715 --> 00:08:40,034
I'm gonna,

219
00:08:40,044 --> 00:08:42,174
I'm gonna move this on because you also put a link here in

220
00:08:42,183 --> 00:08:46,645
the notes titled The Things nobody wants to pay for from WN.

221
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:48,080
Uh I,

222
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:49,549
I won't lie to you.

223
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:54,440
I do not read this because I didn't have time prior to, to recording this episode.

224
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,799
-- So fill us in. What
-- is this? So it's talking

225
00:08:56,989 --> 00:08:59,440
in broad terms. It's just talking about

226
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,320
how

227
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,440
software, like a lot of industries is on the backs of people who will

228
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,559
do insane amounts of hard work for little or no pay.

229
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,760
Like, like the restaurant industry is a perfect example,

230
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,119
like when I, you know,

231
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:16,739
really found out what most restaurant chefs make compared

232
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,359
to how many hours a day they work.

233
00:09:19,109 --> 00:09:22,190
You know, it's like, that's so stupid. Why would you do that? You

234
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,119
earn more money

235
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,239
than mcdonald's?

236
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,239
But I get it's passion, right?

237
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,900
Same thing with like, like teachers, nurses, these people.

238
00:09:30,789 --> 00:09:34,809
Yeah, for what they get paid compared to what they do like, wow. Uh

239
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:38,309
No, it's not passion. It's, it's definitely

240
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:39,070
a

241
00:09:39,609 --> 00:09:39,690
sense

242
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:39,919
of duty

243
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,380
by capitalism.

244
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,669
-- Well, yeah,
-- and, and these, these people have a sense of like duty and obligation to

245
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:48,030
help the world out and they do and thank God because,

246
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,219
but what's interesting to me is that there's

247
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,859
people have always had a need to

248
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:56,539
paint on cave walls or to make music or to

249
00:09:56,669 --> 00:10:00,659
run in and cook for people and make food for people. Right?

250
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:01,900
Like how many people have a, a

251
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,549
relative whose thing is like feeding

252
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,979
20 or 30 people at Thanksgiving and Christmas,

253
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,320
you know,

254
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,880
and they actually enjoy it to some degree.

255
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:13,539
And what's fascinating to me is that software

256
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,039
because in some ways the barrier to entry is so low.

257
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:19,599
Like nowadays you just need a computer and an internet connection, which is,

258
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:20,520
well,

259
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,700
you could just go to the public library and use theirs

260
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,070
if you're in a place with public libraries that have that.

261
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,700
But in general, you know,

262
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:31,039
virtually anybody can get a hold of a one or $200 laptop and an internet connection

263
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:33,130
and join the open source world.

264
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:36,090
All right, I'm going to reframe this discussion because I,

265
00:10:36,099 --> 00:10:38,650
I don't think you're barking up the right tree on this one.

266
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,890
I think

267
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:44,440
this story because I've skimmed a bunch of it since, since you started talking,

268
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:48,359
I think this story can fundamentally be summed up as what we're getting

269
00:10:48,369 --> 00:10:51,700
today in open source is what the market is willing to pay for.

270
00:10:52,289 --> 00:10:54,799
And there's quotes here, there, there's one here talking about when,

271
00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:57,349
why rel deprecated KDE?

272
00:10:57,609 --> 00:11:01,679
Well, yeah, because no one used it and they, I mean, R red, red hat is a great example.

273
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:04,440
They're literally a company. If they don't make money, they don't do a thing.

274
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,359
If someone doesn't use a feature they're going to get rid of.

275
00:11:06,619 --> 00:11:09,849
Right. Because they're not making money off of it. KDE was one of those examples.

276
00:11:09,859 --> 00:11:12,109
Like, they didn't have a lot of users so they got rid of it.

277
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:15,869
I mean, I remember when you were at Red Hat, the whole KDE, like

278
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,840
everything was one or two people. It was

279
00:11:19,489 --> 00:11:19,809
embarrassing.

280
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:20,809
Yeah,

281
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:24,890
it was a miracle. They got it to work because it's like holy crap.

282
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,840
But here's the, that's kind of the default because

283
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:31,739
as a company, if I can keep it working on life support,

284
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,250
why would I do more?

285
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:38,190
Here's where it gets interesting, I think is there's so it says here in a recent Linux

286
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,940
journal discussion, Kent Overstreet who I don't know,

287
00:11:40,989 --> 00:11:43,030
complained about the lack of testing infrastructure for

288
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:44,940
the colonel calling it a failure of leadership.

289
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,349
But then Greg Kh,

290
00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:48,580
who you and I both know and is a very

291
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:51,369
opinionated gentleman will say he said the problem lies elsewhere.

292
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:51,900
No,

293
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:55,719
they fall into the, no company wants to pay someone to do the work category.

294
00:11:55,729 --> 00:11:56,820
So it doesn't get done.

295
00:11:57,109 --> 00:11:59,940
And I think that is exactly correct. I think

296
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,250
if no one wants to pay

297
00:12:01,369 --> 00:12:01,890
for it,

298
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:04,309
don't do it, no one wants it good enough.

299
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,909
The reality is these volunteers are not making a lot of money off doing open source.

300
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:08,280
Like

301
00:12:08,549 --> 00:12:12,799
in most cases at best, they have a job doing it and they're making an ok living,

302
00:12:12,869 --> 00:12:15,070
but they're certainly not bringing in millions or tens of millions of

303
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,760
dollars a year on a product based on that open source.

304
00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:20,359
Whereas a company like I'm gonna pick on Amazon because

305
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:22,510
they're infamous for taking a bunch of open source,

306
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,950
turning it into a service and then

307
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:28,700
selling it as a service and not giving anything back

308
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:31,210
typically or nothing of meaning.

309
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:31,950
Ok.

310
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,809
So, you know, if Amazon's going to do that,

311
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,299
are you going to support them for free and buy testing

312
00:12:36,309 --> 00:12:38,650
infrastructure for them to make sure that it works better?

313
00:12:39,609 --> 00:12:43,010
If Amazon wants to make a lot of money using this thing, then they should,

314
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,039
they should spend the money as needed to do a better

315
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:50,799
-- job
-- or they won't spend any money because it basically works just

316
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,130
-- the way it is.
-- Well, they got it working on their limited set of things.

317
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,250
So, yeah, exactly.

318
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,010
You know,

319
00:12:57,929 --> 00:13:00,590
another great quote here from someone called fungi

320
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,289
from

321
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,419
Python community. I don't know, I don't know what this person is.

322
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:07,830
Companies are unlikely to fund open source communities that are critical

323
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,989
to their own business because someone else will do it.

324
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,780
So it ends up falling on a handful of volunteers and people donating their own

325
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:16,219
time after hours because they're already being paid

326
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,109
to work full time on other stuff.

327
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:18,989
Yeah.

328
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:24,080
-- I mean, there's a lot of that
-- like, I appreciate, for example, when those XML hash off

329
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:24,320
uh

330
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,590
things came out when I just started at Red Hat

331
00:13:26,929 --> 00:13:27,580
and,

332
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,590
you know, the, the, the author was like, yeah,

333
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:33,349
I don't have time to work on this for like two months, but I will happily do it then.

334
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:34,909
And we're like, ok, we'll take on it and do it.

335
00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:39,679
And I actually, in hindsight now totally respect his. Like, this sounds like a

336
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,190
-- problem. Not a me problem.
-- It, it totally is 100%

337
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:46,609
you know, and that's fine. I think that's the right thing to do though.

338
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:49,030
If you're an organization that cares about a thing

339
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:50,599
and you want it fixed,

340
00:13:50,859 --> 00:13:51,789
like, fix it,

341
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,900
-- you know,
-- or if you want to feature

342
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,559
-- funded
-- or

343
00:13:55,729 --> 00:13:59,640
I'm, I'm ok with that. I think that's kind of the nature of open source.

344
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:04,559
I keep saying to myself that like, there's a reckoning coming in open source,

345
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,880
but I don't think there will

346
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,000
no,

347
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:10,000
see, but the thing is as much as I kind of agree with all this,

348
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:13,940
the reality is the world is built on top of, I don't want to say exploitation,

349
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:14,679
but it's,

350
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:16,270
it's built on

351
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,719
using things and not paying for them directly. So, like

352
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,510
every company on the planet uses roads

353
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,869
and, you know, indirectly pays for them with fuel taxes or property taxes or

354
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,929
whatever, some form of taxation, usually

355
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:31,830
sometimes toll roads, but we'll ignore that

356
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:36,200
same thing for having air that's breathable, having contract enforcement,

357
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,049
having a civil law system that does contract enforcement, right?

358
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:39,750
Not the whole,

359
00:14:39,989 --> 00:14:41,789
the whole world is not. But the point I'm getting at is

360
00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:45,549
there is no reckoning coming in because it's typically

361
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:48,025
you can't really use, it's up open source like you can with,

362
00:14:48,385 --> 00:14:49,934
you can't pollute it like a river.

363
00:14:50,085 --> 00:14:51,594
Your example is flawed

364
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:57,494
because you mentioned things like laws and roads and public infrastructure

365
00:14:57,635 --> 00:15:00,145
-- which you pay for indirectly through taxes,
-- right?

366
00:15:00,155 --> 00:15:03,515
Which we actually discussed that we've discussed it many times on the show.

367
00:15:03,525 --> 00:15:07,804
I'm not going to go down the the government taxes open source universe.

368
00:15:07,815 --> 00:15:10,065
But this is, I think the

369
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,960
what you're discussing is public services versus what

370
00:15:13,969 --> 00:15:16,690
open sources today is an exploited ecosystem.

371
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:19,590
But the thing is open source is actually

372
00:15:19,789 --> 00:15:21,780
like a lot cheaper to run. Like

373
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:22,859
I think we can all agree.

374
00:15:22,869 --> 00:15:27,109
We probably don't need as much money as we spend on all the road infrastructure

375
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,840
to properly fund open source. I imagine those two numbers would be very different.

376
00:15:30,849 --> 00:15:31,500
Like open source.

377
00:15:32,859 --> 00:15:38,760
I don't know. Actually, I, I can't answer that. I suspect it's cheaper but I'm not.

378
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,400
When you think about a city like your local city,

379
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:44,599
how many people in public works are out there fixing roads, building roads

380
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,799
were earning a decent wage. Let's see.

381
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:49,900
I mean, you, no, II,

382
00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:53,239
I live in a small city but we're probably talking in the neighborhood of

383
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:57,130
tens of billions of dollars to properly fund open source.

384
00:15:57,219 --> 00:15:59,570
-- That's my guess
-- that's a vastly smaller number

385
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,969
than what everybody spends on roads and trains.

386
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,359
-- I mean,
-- we're talking country level budget, right. This is

387
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:10,380
my point being that this isn't a problem like the state of New York could solve,

388
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:10,659
right?

389
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:11,619
Like we need

390
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,859
some sort of global effort

391
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,130
if we want to fund

392
00:16:15,244 --> 00:16:15,695
stuff.

393
00:16:15,705 --> 00:16:18,424
I mean, this is where, like the, so funny enough, remember we talked to the,

394
00:16:18,434 --> 00:16:20,344
the Sovereign Tech Fund folks a while back.

395
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:23,205
I I should have say the article, I don't even know where I saw it,

396
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,335
but apparently France is starting something very

397
00:16:25,344 --> 00:16:26,844
similar to the Sovereign Tech Fund now.

398
00:16:26,854 --> 00:16:28,005
And I'm like, yes,

399
00:16:28,104 --> 00:16:31,664
so the German Sovereign Tech Fund basically takes applications to fund open

400
00:16:31,864 --> 00:16:36,825
source activity, not just necessarily security stuff but usability, whatever

401
00:16:37,109 --> 00:16:37,989
as I understand it.

402
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,659
And I'm going to be doing some work for them,

403
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:41,919
evaluating open source projects and what I really appreciate

404
00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:43,729
them is they don't just have me like,

405
00:16:43,739 --> 00:16:45,010
evaluate a bunch of projects.

406
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:48,130
I actually have to like staggering them from like one to whatever.

407
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,669
And then ideally also get on a call with a couple of other people that are doing this.

408
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:52,859
And then I assume we just,

409
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,260
it's like, you know,

410
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,909
it's like baseball draft or something where we

411
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:57,710
just started like hashing it out and picking,

412
00:16:57,719 --> 00:16:58,000
you know,

413
00:16:58,455 --> 00:16:59,726
fantasy football for

414
00:17:00,776 --> 00:17:03,645
-- things
-- and looking at things like, not just, you know,

415
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:04,744
for example,

416
00:17:04,755 --> 00:17:06,526
it can be a software that's directly used by a lot of

417
00:17:06,536 --> 00:17:08,474
people or it could be like a boring piece of software.

418
00:17:08,484 --> 00:17:10,765
Like, remember we looked through the, the, um,

419
00:17:10,945 --> 00:17:13,964
oh, that list that not the sovereign tech fund, but the other one had

420
00:17:14,175 --> 00:17:17,156
with the bug bounties and there was like that fishing software in there.

421
00:17:17,165 --> 00:17:19,005
And I'm like, yeah, I guess people need to,

422
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:21,760
you know,

423
00:17:22,651 --> 00:17:24,800
and so it's, it's really interesting to see that.

424
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:24,961
Well,

425
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,480
basically they're trying to get as much bang for their Dollar or Deutschmark as,

426
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,220
or sorry.

427
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,681
Euro. Wow. I'm old.

428
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,161
Get as much bang for their Euro as they can

429
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,510
and not just necessarily for that software but for,

430
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,340
you know, kind of what, what impact could this have, could it, you know,

431
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,081
maybe inspire other people, things like that.

432
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:43,219
And I think this is part of the way forward because then

433
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,839
at least we'll kind of have that critical level of like,

434
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:48,430
ok, this is stuff that we absolutely really need.

435
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:48,719
Like,

436
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,589
we can all, like, we could live without audacity. It would

437
00:17:51,699 --> 00:17:54,729
not be fun and you'd be annoyed because you'd have to find some new software.

438
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,869
I haven't used audacity in a long time.

439
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,040
They got evil

440
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,280
and a lot of people quit using

441
00:17:59,579 --> 00:17:59,930
evil.

442
00:18:00,109 --> 00:18:00,310
Yeah,

443
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,069
it's a long story. I'm not going to go into it,

444
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,459
but I'm actually using a closed source product now called Reefer,

445
00:18:05,469 --> 00:18:06,530
which is just like,

446
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:10,079
it is like flying the space shuttle of audio.

447
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,400
I learned it and it is incredibly useful.

448
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,390
And it's one of those things like I'm happy to,

449
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,199
it's just like some guy is the author of it and I'm happy to

450
00:18:18,209 --> 00:18:21,280
give him some cash and I get a product that it probably cuts.

451
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:22,800
So this is funny, actually,

452
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,069
it should have cut down my editing time

453
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:27,969
by a pretty wide margin because generally speaking,

454
00:18:27,979 --> 00:18:28,829
the way I

455
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,550
say editing audio works is number of guest times length

456
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,810
of audio is how long it takes me to edit,

457
00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:36,310
which is generally true.

458
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:38,630
But because Reaper has so many extra knobs to twiddle,

459
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,050
it definitely takes me longer to edit shows now than it

460
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,979
used to because I keep like messing with stuff constantly,

461
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:44,709
but

462
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:48,119
-- whatever it is what it is anyway,
-- sorry, I was just looking up audacity

463
00:18:48,569 --> 00:18:48,599
fire

464
00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:49,300
stuff.

465
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:52,670
So it's complicated. I don't remember even the whole story.

466
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,229
I just know like it went off the rails and I quit using it

467
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:57,180
and I'm very happy with Reaper.

468
00:18:57,189 --> 00:18:59,339
-- So
-- it's like, well,

469
00:18:59,349 --> 00:19:02,170
a perfect example locally we now have um so

470
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,300
we almost had rotating blackouts because of the cold.

471
00:19:04,339 --> 00:19:07,119
Now today we have a water related emergency.

472
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:09,280
So Edmonton has two water treatment plants.

473
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,900
The Rossdale, which is the really old one,

474
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,839
right? And the New El Smith, which is the really big one

475
00:19:15,469 --> 00:19:17,890
and apparently the entire water delivery system.

476
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,540
So like takes the water that they've treated

477
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:22,390
and pumps it into the Edmonton water system,

478
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,300
which also feeds a couple of other small towns in the nearby area.

479
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,780
It's broken.

480
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,209
Whoops.

481
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:30,910
Yeah. And they don't know when it'll be fixed. So, like, they're literally,

482
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:33,520
they were saying, like, major water users need to stop using water,

483
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:34,689
but they were even giving advice.

484
00:19:34,699 --> 00:19:36,439
Like, if you're brushing your teeth, turn the tap off,

485
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,359
like, while you're brushing, like, I'm not sure how much that's gonna help,

486
00:19:40,369 --> 00:19:41,170
but sure.

487
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,880
But it's, but it's, it's kind of like,

488
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,630
honestly, the water system is limping along because we've got the raw stale.

489
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,170
But it's,

490
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:52,369
you know, it's like, I think one, if I had to guess I'd say it's like 1/5 of what we need.

491
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,150
But the point is like, it's, it's limping along.

492
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,729
-- Things haven't gone off the rails yet.
-- No,

493
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:56,949
no,

494
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:57,949
no.

495
00:19:57,959 --> 00:20:01,619
I think, I think you're on to something and this, this is the, the, I think the,

496
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,530
the discussion to end the show is.

497
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,709
So I think what you're describing is

498
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,630
in North America,

499
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:12,229
an enormous amount of public infrastructure has been neglected

500
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:14,939
for probably the last 20 to 40 years.

501
00:20:16,056 --> 00:20:18,365
And an enormous amount of it is going to

502
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:21,056
start failing catastrophically because it's like the old saying,

503
00:20:21,066 --> 00:20:24,235
if you don't schedule downtime, your equipment will, right?

504
00:20:24,245 --> 00:20:28,206
I think we're, we're going to see that more and more often because, like,

505
00:20:28,215 --> 00:20:30,326
you have to maintain this stuff, you can't just like,

506
00:20:30,336 --> 00:20:31,855
use it and forget about it forever.

507
00:20:31,865 --> 00:20:35,276
Right. And I think maybe that's part of the problem is we're seeing that sort of

508
00:20:35,446 --> 00:20:39,436
starting to come home to roost in the open source world where, I mean,

509
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:42,056
it's not like they're building financial products out of this stuff, but they're,

510
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:42,515
they're, no,

511
00:20:42,862 --> 00:20:44,161
they're, they're using it.

512
00:20:44,342 --> 00:20:47,582
And the thing is I keep coming back to if they were just using it. Sure.

513
00:20:47,592 --> 00:20:49,802
But they're using it and making demands of people and like,

514
00:20:49,812 --> 00:20:51,432
stressing them out and making them miserable.

515
00:20:51,442 --> 00:20:53,062
Like a great example is curl

516
00:20:53,241 --> 00:20:55,212
like Daniel posts those

517
00:20:55,472 --> 00:20:58,602
emails he gets from people who are like, you're hacking me because of the thing,

518
00:20:58,612 --> 00:20:59,401
blah, blah, blah, blah.

519
00:20:59,702 --> 00:21:01,552
And like I got that too.

520
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:02,241
And you know, I,

521
00:21:02,251 --> 00:21:04,391
I've literally been on the receiving end of that and

522
00:21:04,401 --> 00:21:06,161
seen other people on the receiving end of that,

523
00:21:06,171 --> 00:21:09,921
like where a company did something with a piece of software shipped it badly

524
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:13,479
and the person like kind of searches the error

525
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:15,569
message and comes to this open source project and like

526
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,520
screams at them and they're like,

527
00:21:17,689 --> 00:21:18,890
what are you even talking about?

528
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,780
Like, my favorite was people would take copies of the links, administrator,

529
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,569
security guide, post it on their websites.

530
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:26,050
And I actually kind of preferred it when they removed my name

531
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,290
because they would post it on my web on their website,

532
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,170
leave my name

533
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,300
and then people would yell at me for not updating it, of course.

534
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,089
And I'd be like, yeah,

535
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:37,719
IA I didn't know that it existed on that website in wherever and b I can, it's

536
00:21:37,834 --> 00:21:39,015
my website and they're like, what do you mean?

537
00:21:39,025 --> 00:21:40,584
It's not your website, it's your content. And I'm like,

538
00:21:41,045 --> 00:21:42,255
do you know how cut and paste works?

539
00:21:42,675 --> 00:21:45,135
Like it just, there was no reasoning with these people. Right.

540
00:21:45,145 --> 00:21:46,994
Because if they could be reasoned with, they wouldn't have

541
00:21:47,135 --> 00:21:48,854
attacked me in the first place.

542
00:21:49,135 --> 00:21:51,484
Well, it, it's complicated, I think.

543
00:21:51,954 --> 00:21:54,885
But, but regardless the point is right,

544
00:21:55,334 --> 00:21:59,474
I think some of our infrastructure is going to be a similar,

545
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:03,079
I will come. I I'm not sure what word to use here, but like

546
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:07,060
if we continue to neglect open source and we don't do anything about it,

547
00:22:07,069 --> 00:22:08,579
there are people starting to do things.

548
00:22:08,589 --> 00:22:10,459
So this may not come to fruition.

549
00:22:10,469 --> 00:22:16,400
But like if we continue to neglect it for long enough, like it's going to collapse,

550
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:16,760
right?

551
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:21,520
That is the inevitable outcome of neglecting a system such as

552
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:21,994
yes.

553
00:22:22,314 --> 00:22:26,694
And the question is, does it collapse collapse or does it sort of decline or,

554
00:22:26,895 --> 00:22:29,905
you know, like that's a great example is the oil and gas industry.

555
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:32,125
Like if we turned off oil and gas tomorrow,

556
00:22:32,135 --> 00:22:33,665
everything would crash because we don't have time

557
00:22:33,675 --> 00:22:34,925
to transition and we don't have the,

558
00:22:35,084 --> 00:22:35,234
the

559
00:22:35,334 --> 00:22:36,875
things we need to transition. But

560
00:22:37,005 --> 00:22:39,645
had we spent say from the 19 seventies,

561
00:22:39,814 --> 00:22:41,265
uh you know, oil crisis

562
00:22:41,454 --> 00:22:43,025
really transitioning

563
00:22:43,734 --> 00:22:47,265
well, yeah, like 50 years later, we'd probably all be driving electric cars by now.

564
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:49,645
I mean, it's certainly a possibility.

565
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:50,890
It, it,

566
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:51,089
it,

567
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:52,280
I,

568
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:57,359
I don't know if that's technically a perfect analogy here, but I, I feel like

569
00:22:57,939 --> 00:23:01,199
it might be now at the same time, it's also plausible

570
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,020
that open source is one of those industries where

571
00:23:04,369 --> 00:23:09,800
the, the powers that be are more than happy to just let people show up, get burnt out,

572
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:13,479
leave and get replaced by someone else doing some other thing.

573
00:23:13,489 --> 00:23:15,880
You know, two problems with that theory though is one

574
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:20,209
existing open source is vast and complex

575
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:23,069
and you can't just show up and start

576
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,319
contributing right away.

577
00:23:24,329 --> 00:23:27,839
Like there's a, there's an on ramp and a learning curve for a lot of software,

578
00:23:28,469 --> 00:23:29,560
right? Like, I mean,

579
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,819
you can't just write a Linux device driver,

580
00:23:31,829 --> 00:23:34,199
you need to probably spend a couple hours reading

581
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:35,780
-- is
-- special. Don't bring

582
00:23:36,069 --> 00:23:36,420
into this

583
00:23:36,579 --> 00:23:37,290
even set an A

584
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,050
like they're so optimized like panda or numpy.

585
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:43,729
Those are, no, no, I don't think that's how it works. I think.

586
00:23:43,739 --> 00:23:45,020
No, but what I'm trying to say is

587
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,150
to get fresh people into the software ecosystem and get them productive.

588
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:52,819
-- It's not like they just join and are immediately productive.
-- No, they do.

589
00:23:52,829 --> 00:23:54,250
They do though. I think they do

590
00:23:54,449 --> 00:23:58,050
because I think here's what happens. Let's pick on like go or Rust, right?

591
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,180
These are relatively new languages

592
00:24:00,449 --> 00:24:03,430
and there's a ton of people that just showed up one day and

593
00:24:03,439 --> 00:24:06,805
made a thing because they needed a thing to do a job.

594
00:24:07,244 --> 00:24:09,964
And like these are ecosystems

595
00:24:10,114 --> 00:24:11,135
that I'm,

596
00:24:11,145 --> 00:24:13,444
I'm seeing it now where there's people clearly burning

597
00:24:13,454 --> 00:24:14,895
out in some of these places and they're like,

598
00:24:14,905 --> 00:24:15,604
I'm out

599
00:24:15,984 --> 00:24:16,555
and

600
00:24:16,724 --> 00:24:20,885
some of those things are widely used and we're going to find out what happened.

601
00:24:20,895 --> 00:24:22,444
Well, what I was trying to get to is

602
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:25,244
if, for example, all the rust developers quit,

603
00:24:26,189 --> 00:24:29,869
there wouldn't be a crop of new people that would show up and be immediately

604
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:34,239
-- helpful. Like it would take a while.
-- No, it wouldn't. Rust dies.

605
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,829
That's how that ends. Like

606
00:24:36,089 --> 00:24:39,380
if you have an ecosystem like that where a bunch of people burn out and quit,

607
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:42,099
I think it's going to die and be replaced by something else.

608
00:24:42,109 --> 00:24:44,390
I don't think people are going to show up and fix it. And I think

609
00:24:44,689 --> 00:24:47,520
that is part of the other piece to this whole open source.

610
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:52,510
The things nobody wants to do is when you have a project that exists, like let's, I,

611
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,000
I will pick on the Linux kernel.

612
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:54,750
In this instance,

613
00:24:54,969 --> 00:25:00,229
the Linux kernel is probably the most established and largest open source project

614
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,219
ever, maybe ever. That will be right

615
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,670
now. At the same time,

616
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,560
I don't think you're gonna see loads of new people just

617
00:25:09,569 --> 00:25:11,530
like show up out of the blue to work on Linux,

618
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,520
they're gonna be paid to do it because first of all,

619
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:16,140
there's a lot of companies that need it.

620
00:25:16,229 --> 00:25:18,000
But at the same time, if I'm a new person,

621
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:20,380
I'm not gonna even try to get involved in Linux

622
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:25,390
because the the barrier of entry is a freaking mile high

623
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,300
cliff or we'll say kilometer high cliff for you educated folks.

624
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,979
But like it's, it's gigantic, right?

625
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:34,560
Or I could just do my own little thing and create a repo and

626
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:35,250
github

627
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:36,959
and good enough. Yo.

628
00:25:37,439 --> 00:25:41,800
Well, and my other thought is now, for example, what I wonder what the average

629
00:25:41,939 --> 00:25:44,750
age of a Linux kernel developer is

630
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:49,020
and especially, I hate to say this, but if you look at the established names in it,

631
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,800
obviously, they're all getting a year older, one year at a time like Greg

632
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:52,000
Pearl

633
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:52,670
Hartman, Lin

634
00:25:53,369 --> 00:25:53,900
Carl. But really

635
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:57,520
all those established names have been there for

636
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,130
-- years or more.
-- There's a lot of

637
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:04,640
communities in general that suffer this problem and there's,

638
00:26:05,089 --> 00:26:06,819
we're not going to talk about it today

639
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:11,540
because it's, it's a big can of worms. But here's the thing I keep thinking of

640
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:17,540
is how many of these communities don't have fresh people because the

641
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:20,670
old people won't just get the freaking heck out of the way

642
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:23,020
because like I have been in working groups

643
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,959
that had, people will say that are well past the point,

644
00:26:26,969 --> 00:26:28,880
they should have been involved in their

645
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:31,040
careers and just personal lives and everything

646
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:35,459
and they will not leave and anyone young and competent is like,

647
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:38,869
I'm out because I've talked to people that like be like, please come back and help me.

648
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,439
They're like, no, that guy's an idiot. I'm not coming back and I'm like,

649
00:26:41,689 --> 00:26:44,810
I mean, you're not wrong. I'm not going to argue with you. But,

650
00:26:45,069 --> 00:26:45,560
yeah, I've,

651
00:26:45,569 --> 00:26:49,224
I've seen a lot of that and I'm actually beginning to suffer some of that myself.

652
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:53,045
I'm very aware of the fact that if anyone younger than me wants to help,

653
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:58,704
I'm out, I'm gone. Like, yep, I'm out, I'm not gonna stay and mess things up because I,

654
00:26:59,114 --> 00:27:01,905
I know I'm out of touch in a lot of ways and that's ok.

655
00:27:02,084 --> 00:27:04,145
Like that's part of how it goes, you know?

656
00:27:04,614 --> 00:27:05,145
Yeah.

657
00:27:05,364 --> 00:27:06,385
And so

658
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:08,104
I don't know, I just,

659
00:27:08,939 --> 00:27:10,400
I think it's going to be one of those things where it's

660
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:13,040
fine until it isn't fine and then when it isn't fine,

661
00:27:13,969 --> 00:27:16,079
there's, you know, not

662
00:27:17,229 --> 00:27:21,189
the expertise to actually implement a solution is nontrivial here.

663
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,459
Right? This isn't a thing where you can simply throw more money on it. Right? Like

664
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:27,380
we're witnessing the whole thing where uh Cisa released that thing

665
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:30,099
saying that developers need to be part of the security conversation.

666
00:27:30,109 --> 00:27:31,349
Yes. Yes, they do.

667
00:27:31,479 --> 00:27:33,569
And as we've learned from 50 years of computer

668
00:27:33,579 --> 00:27:36,890
security educating developers is not going to fix this

669
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,239
and assuming you can educate them,

670
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,369
then they have to work at a company where they're like, yeah, well,

671
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,569
we'll let you go like half the speed that we want you to go.

672
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:46,069
So you can write secure code and not just crank out features

673
00:27:46,609 --> 00:27:47,560
like I'm sorry, but

674
00:27:47,739 --> 00:27:49,770
outside of the space shuttle software, you know,

675
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,900
which is infamous for being very good.

676
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:56,910
And like they had a problem with the Canada arm and then they like, actually fixed it,

677
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,609
but fixed it in case they ever mounted it on the

678
00:27:58,619 --> 00:28:00,250
left side as well as the right side or whatever,

679
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:00,949
vice versa.

680
00:28:01,099 --> 00:28:01,599
Right.

681
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:04,099
-- I love that. It's just called the Canada arm.
-- That's

682
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,699
the one, it's our claim to fame. Damn, it,

683
00:28:07,099 --> 00:28:10,189
there's one on the space station too. Like it's a good arm.

684
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,130
It's our thing, right? Like,

685
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:14,839
I like that Canada was smart enough to be like, yeah, we,

686
00:28:14,849 --> 00:28:17,880
we can't really afford a shuttle but like we can build you an arm for it.

687
00:28:18,349 --> 00:28:20,660
I love, it's awesome. You know, and it's a cool arm.

688
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:24,630
-- Like, anyway, anyway,
-- uh they had a mock up of it back in the day at tell us,

689
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,900
which I liked looking at the tell us world signs anyways.

690
00:28:27,069 --> 00:28:27,880
So to be blunt,

691
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,189
this is one of the reasons I love curl

692
00:28:29,199 --> 00:28:31,829
because he keeps celebrating new people joining curl.

693
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:35,119
-- And they're up to like, what is it? Over 1200 now? It's
-- a lot of people. Yeah.

694
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:35,479
You know,

695
00:28:35,949 --> 00:28:36,380
and I,

696
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,319
I don't see a lot of projects doing that.

697
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,890
I don't know of any other projects that do stuff like that.

698
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,229
And I think it's a really big deal and I think it's very cool.

699
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,880
-- To, to make it a big deal. So
-- I just looked at the NTPK her brief

700
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,150
and it hasn't had a commit in nine years.

701
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:54,930
I, I don't, does, is NTP still used, aren't there?

702
00:28:54,939 --> 00:28:56,439
There's something else isn't there now,

703
00:28:57,109 --> 00:28:57,189
N

704
00:28:57,439 --> 00:29:00,319
PC. And I

705
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:02,369
actually, you know what, you just reminded me of that.

706
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,209
I'm going to end the podcast on because I feel

707
00:29:04,219 --> 00:29:07,770
like we've come with no solutions to anything other than

708
00:29:08,569 --> 00:29:12,050
-- maybe things are terrible but probably
-- not buy canned food.

709
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,619
I, I guess, no, I'm not buying canned food. If my

710
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:22,209
all right, all you preppers. My, my plan for the fall of society is to die first.

711
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:23,010
So

712
00:29:24,069 --> 00:29:26,199
it's foolproof as far as I'm concerned.

713
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,099
But anyway, anyway, uh,

714
00:29:28,109 --> 00:29:30,280
there's one other thing I'll mention about all this kind of

715
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:35,630
old man stuff is there was a history of X Windows.

716
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,359
I found on youtube the other day and watched it and it was quite good.

717
00:29:38,689 --> 00:29:42,229
Yeah, it starts like at the very beginning and basically explains like the madness.

718
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,750
And it's funny because I remember watching this.

719
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,800
I'm like, oh, I remember that, I remember that guy.

720
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,160
Like, I remember when that happened

721
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,069
and it was very nostalgic for me,

722
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:54,180
but for anyone who's ever wondered why X Windows seems as ridiculous as it is.

723
00:29:54,189 --> 00:29:57,479
It's because it is ridiculous and there's ridiculous reasons. It is ridiculous.

724
00:29:57,489 --> 00:30:01,380
-- So it's very good.
-- It also came from a time where literally,

725
00:30:01,579 --> 00:30:04,939
-- I don't have enough horsepower to run application, whatever
-- they

726
00:30:04,949 --> 00:30:05,410
-- talk
-- about

727
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:05,699
that.

728
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,550
And so I'm going to run

729
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,910
on the sun pizza box and display it to my crappy little PC.

730
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:13,229
-- They talk about that. That's part of the part of the story.
-- This is what I

731
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:17,390
love is watching people in the A I space rediscover resource limitations

732
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,550
and just struggle with it like they are just hurting.

733
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,560
No, we're not doing this right now. I want to end this on a semi

734
00:30:24,729 --> 00:30:25,800
posit note.

735
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,430
And I guess here is what I will say

736
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,349
is while I read stories like these about the

737
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:35,010
builds and the things open source doesn't want to

738
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,829
do and talking about all these working groups full

739
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:40,170
of people who push out the youth or whatever.

740
00:30:40,209 --> 00:30:41,709
I think fundamentally

741
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:45,069
the fact that we're at least acknowledging this

742
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:46,829
I think is an acceptable

743
00:30:46,969 --> 00:30:49,390
first step. There's a long way to go.

744
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,390
But I think five or 10 years ago,

745
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,270
no one was even talking about this stuff and people

746
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,229
on the inside of open source knew this was brewing,

747
00:30:57,339 --> 00:31:02,459
but no one else did. But today, I feel like it's definitely becoming a bigger issue.

748
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,069
So I'm hopeful

749
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,310
there are people

750
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:09,069
in positions to make a difference that we also notice this

751
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:11,430
and we'll see more things like the sovereign tech fund,

752
00:31:11,439 --> 00:31:15,780
for example, trying to make open source more sustainable

753
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:18,430
and make it survive into the future.

754
00:31:18,439 --> 00:31:21,410
Well, I think more to the point, it's probably a lot like NASA,

755
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,839
where every dollar you spend fixing some open

756
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:26,219
source component that like your country relies upon,

757
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:28,469
probably indirectly returns

758
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,750
easily 10 to 100 times that

759
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:35,390
just the friction alone of like people having to switch to something else or a

760
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,939
single log for Jay incident. Like

761
00:31:38,189 --> 00:31:38,989
good Lord,

762
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,829
the amount of time we all wasted on log for Jay doing silly things like

763
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,719
the number of security questionnaires.

764
00:31:44,729 --> 00:31:46,640
I had to fill out to tell people my,

765
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:50,869
like our response as an organization to log for Jay and it's like none like we don't,

766
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,670
don't use it.

767
00:31:51,969 --> 00:31:52,349
Sorry,

768
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:52,689
I'm

769
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:53,969
calling it. I'm calling it.

770
00:31:55,109 --> 00:31:57,140
I guess the good news is, yeah, people are aware of this.

771
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,729
We're seeing articles about it and we're actually seeing

772
00:31:58,739 --> 00:32:00,530
governments start to spend some money on it.

773
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:02,329
-- I hope so,
-- man. Which makes you real.

774
00:32:03,109 --> 00:32:05,130
All right. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.
