Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 145 with myself,

1
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,000
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,309
So, do you have any terrible math problems for me? With 145?

3
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:18,270
Nope,

4
00:00:19,049 --> 00:00:19,700
good.

5
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,530
Still can't do math. I actually, it was funny.

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,750
My, my son asked me for math help yesterday and I was like, super overcomplicated.

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,760
He's like dad, the answer is right here like, oh, ok.

8
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:31,610
Anyway,

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,180
it's like, yeah, so 12 year old schooling me in math now. So that's neat.

10
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:39,389
But I'll just, I'll, I'll, I'll give him a calculus challenge one of these days.

11
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,369
Right. And that'll be his lesson. But

12
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:43,159
anyway, anyway,

13
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,130
so

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,490
fire,

15
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,130
what do you think of when I say fire, Kurt?

16
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,000
Uh my first thought is, I hope my smoke alarms are all working,

17
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:57,720
that's actually related. So, here's the discussion of the day

18
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,319
down the street from my house,

19
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:05,120
a building burnt down the other day and like, I mean, like it burned down. Right.

20
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:06,959
This isn't like, oh, there's a charred building.

21
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,699
No, there is a pile of rubble where a building used to be,

22
00:01:10,809 --> 00:01:13,699
which is obviously like as crazy as it gets for fire. But it,

23
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:17,389
it really got me thinking about the topic of fire

24
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,559
and the topic of security

25
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:24,180
and kind of, here's the broad observation I made and,

26
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:27,489
and we can discuss this and you can disagree with me all you want. But like

27
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,120
when, when a fire happens, fundamentally,

28
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:34,680
there are a number of things that go into motion and

29
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,430
people generally know what to do without too much trouble.

30
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,739
And I don't just mean, like the bystanders, I mean,

31
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,160
the fire department and there's fire inspectors and

32
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:44,300
there's insurance companies and all kinds of stuff.

33
00:01:44,309 --> 00:01:45,760
And I think about security

34
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,680
and let's say there's some sort of security emergency.

35
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:54,680
What do you do? Does anybody know what to do? Is there anyone you can call for help?

36
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,870
Is there any way to clean up the mess afterwards? That makes sense.

37
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,970
And I think the answer is basically no to all of those things.

38
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,569
I'd say it's worse than that because what

39
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,880
even is a security disaster or security problem?

40
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:09,508
Right. There's,

41
00:02:10,157 --> 00:02:13,988
you know, there's, have I been pwned? There's, um, Citrix

42
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:16,348
being compromised for six months. There's

43
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:22,419
-- that, that's a good story. You know, fire, I don't want to say fire is simple but
-- it is,

44
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,179
it is

45
00:02:23,358 --> 00:02:28,578
when I say fire where it's relatively simple to define it as something on fire.

46
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:30,619
Yes. And, and that's fair.

47
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:35,210
And so let's, let's box this in because you're right when we talk about security,

48
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,979
security doesn't really mean anything.

49
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:43,339
It, it's a million things but let's think about just a, a compromise of your network.

50
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,100
Right. Where essentially something has happened.

51
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,860
Catastrophic.

52
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:50,139
What now?

53
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,119
Well, it doesn't even have to be catastrophic. Right.

54
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,130
Like, for example, you might notice,

55
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,369
oh, all the servers are, you know, there's,

56
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,850
there's people logging in from IP S in a

57
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,889
whatever country it is that we're not friends with today

58
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:04,729
and we don't have offices over there.

59
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:08,089
But, but I think just for the simplicity's sake, let's assume,

60
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,250
like you've been hacked as bad as you can get hacked.

61
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:13,509
Right. Like it's all burnt down.

62
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,929
There's a pile of rubble that you used to call the server room.

63
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,470
What do you do now?

64
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,360
Well, you, you start rebuilding,

65
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:24,490
you know, you try and get clean hardware or clean the hardware that you have,

66
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,889
you try and restore everything and

67
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:28,690
nine times out of 10, when you read about people doing that, it's,

68
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:31,820
it's a complete mess because to put it bluntly,

69
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:34,139
if they were capable of running it

70
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,050
reasonably well, they wouldn't have gotten into that situation. Maybe.

71
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:39,289
I mean, it's hard to say

72
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:39,949
-- part of
-- it

73
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,720
is Survivor bias in the sense of

74
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,589
the people who get kind of really hacked the worst.

75
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,669
You know, they probably don't have great backups.

76
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,229
-- It's possible
-- they probably don't have, you know,

77
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,979
inventories of what they actually have and need.

78
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,270
Oh, this is actually, you,

79
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:57,270
you've got me thinking about a new thing that I hadn't even considered before.

80
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,440
You're kind of. Right.

81
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:58,949
Yeah.

82
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,250
In terms of, if you don't have good backups and, and let's say so, in,

83
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:07,210
in the building that burnt down down the street, for me, it was a very old building.

84
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,470
It was over 100 years old. So obviously

85
00:04:09,779 --> 00:04:11,479
it lacked some of the modern,

86
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,250
we'll say fire prevention measures they put in

87
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:16,290
where they build buildings in certain ways.

88
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:18,108
-- Yeah,
-- it's definitely not up to fire code.

89
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:18,579
Right.

90
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:19,548
Like now they, you know,

91
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:22,750
they section things off and there's like fire doors and they make sure like

92
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,480
the fire can't get in the walls and fly up into the attic,

93
00:04:25,554 --> 00:04:28,385
which I'm sure happened and, and they put sprinklers in.

94
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:30,385
Right? And they have smoke alarms up the

95
00:04:30,654 --> 00:04:33,274
wazoo in these places and, and thank goodness, nobody got hurt,

96
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:36,225
which is one of the reasons I'm really happy to talk about this because obviously,

97
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:39,695
if there'd been loss of life, it would be a very, very different story.

98
00:04:39,704 --> 00:04:41,345
But, but the point is

99
00:04:41,654 --> 00:04:44,494
when you have that kind of legacy infrastructure,

100
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,859
when something goes wrong,

101
00:04:47,059 --> 00:04:49,880
the building is probably going to burn down,

102
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,980
like you're not going to burn a little bit and recover, it's probably gone.

103
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:58,779
You know what? No, actually most building fires are contained and it's

104
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,019
not that big a deal.

105
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:03,420
Like locally we've, there's been, you know, and we talked about this in the past,

106
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:04,459
there was that in, um,

107
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,369
there was one case of arson where a

108
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,119
framer burned down some buildings he was working on

109
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,859
because he did subpar work and he thought he could hide it by burning it all down.

110
00:05:12,109 --> 00:05:14,170
And there's been a couple of days, remember we discussed with the,

111
00:05:14,179 --> 00:05:16,299
the potted plants that aren't actually in dirt anymore.

112
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:18,450
They're in that like dry peat moss stuff that

113
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,049
up a cigarette out in it and it,

114
00:05:20,179 --> 00:05:21,429
while your condo burns down.

115
00:05:21,619 --> 00:05:25,640
But the like the majority of fires typically don't result

116
00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:27,910
in a con like a complete loss of the structure.

117
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,380
Like a great example here is we have a,

118
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:34,010
100 plus year old hotel in the sort of historical white Ave district of Edmonton

119
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,140
and they're doing some renovations on it. Was it a plumber or something

120
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,570
or a grinder?

121
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:41,399
I think it was a grinder basically, you know, started a small fire,

122
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,100
they thought they put it out with a fire extinguisher.

123
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:46,970
And then like 1012 hours later, the fire department was called out because it,

124
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,279
you know, the building was burning down a bit.

125
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:51,000
And I feel really bad because actually I was out with my partner and we went to dinner

126
00:05:51,429 --> 00:05:55,140
and, uh, she and I were walking past that place and we,

127
00:05:55,149 --> 00:05:58,220
we were smelling this wonderful wood smoke smell and we were wondering,

128
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:58,630
you know,

129
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,459
was it Cortizon or was it like which of

130
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,820
the restaurants was using some really nice smelling wood to

131
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:05,359
smoke meat and this was half an hour before the

132
00:06:05,369 --> 00:06:07,070
fire department showed up to put this fire out.

133
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,059
So,

134
00:06:09,049 --> 00:06:11,329
and, and, but that's the thing. As soon as somebody noticed

135
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,410
smoke and flames, they call the fire department,

136
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,920
the fire department shows up pretty clear what you

137
00:06:15,929 --> 00:06:17,519
do if you're the fire department out of fire.

138
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:19,019
Right. You go put it out. So they did.

139
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,420
So, there's a bit of damage to the building. But

140
00:06:21,609 --> 00:06:24,239
yeah, the, the developer, it's, it's in the process of being renovated.

141
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,420
He's like, yeah, this sucks. But yeah, we'll just, we'll carry on, we'll fix it.

142
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:32,850
And you look at the majority of fires now, especially North America and Europe.

143
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,640
That's generally what happens, like, yeah,

144
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:38,220
it burns down a little bit and there's usually a ton of smoke and water damage,

145
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:40,750
but it's not like the building is gone typically.

146
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,299
Like, that's actually relatively rare

147
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:46,019
and, and that's fair. I admit I didn't look into that statistic, but

148
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:47,179
so here's

149
00:06:47,609 --> 00:06:48,869
what I want to do

150
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:51,149
is let's go back in time

151
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,640
and they look at the way fire,

152
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,679
I guess prevention used to work because the history

153
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,130
here is actually fascinating in a lot of ways.

154
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,549
And I think there's some parallels and there's probably some lessons for us.

155
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:04,549
Now, first of all, I will say

156
00:07:04,929 --> 00:07:08,269
the research I did kind of started off in Ancient Rome.

157
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:11,769
I, I didn't find anything that went back farther. I don't know.

158
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:14,450
I'm sure there's something you could go back

159
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,489
well past or before Rome, I guess.

160
00:07:17,829 --> 00:07:18,339
But

161
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,329
that's where I landed. Right. And so Rome burned more than once.

162
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,140
And

163
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,859
obviously we look at a lot of the ancient world and we're like, oh,

164
00:07:26,869 --> 00:07:28,470
look at all these beautiful stone buildings.

165
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,859
They don't build them like that anymore.

166
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,269
And, yeah, that's because all the wood ones burnt down or fell down. Right.

167
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:35,700
So, there were wooden structures a long time ago.

168
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:40,049
And it sounds like from pretty much ancient Roman times until like the 18

169
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,359
hundreds, maybe

170
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:46,239
it was basically you were on your own. There was no fire department.

171
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,500
There was no, like government help for the most part.

172
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,140
If a building lit on fire, it was your problem.

173
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:54,980
And it turns out that what happened, I guess is in a lot of these

174
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,880
kind of cultures and neighborhoods from way back in the day.

175
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,350
Like, if your neighbor's house started on fire,

176
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,230
people would show up and, like,

177
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:05,369
tear down your neighbor's house to keep it away from yours or if there

178
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,250
was a house between your neighbors and yours who that was on fire,

179
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,829
they tear down the house in the middle to keep your house safe.

180
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:15,350
Like it was, it was completely barbaric and, and bizarre to think about.

181
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:18,005
-- Well,
-- but what else are you going to do? Right. They didn't have water pumps.

182
00:08:18,015 --> 00:08:19,815
They didn't have water supplies, like, you know,

183
00:08:20,174 --> 00:08:22,045
throwing buckets of water at this thing, you know,

184
00:08:22,154 --> 00:08:25,084
and I know that's still the case for a lot of rural fires. Right.

185
00:08:25,095 --> 00:08:26,084
The fire department shows up,

186
00:08:26,095 --> 00:08:30,125
they maybe have X hundreds or thousands of gallons of water in their, uh,

187
00:08:30,505 --> 00:08:31,334
in their truck.

188
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:34,325
And so at that point, you know, it's containment

189
00:08:34,744 --> 00:08:36,645
or saving the farmhouse or whatever. Right.

190
00:08:36,655 --> 00:08:39,315
Because you, well, you classic, you got to pick your battles,

191
00:08:39,515 --> 00:08:39,804
you know,

192
00:08:39,815 --> 00:08:41,364
and there's been cases where they've let

193
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,445
buildings burn down locally because they're just way

194
00:08:43,455 --> 00:08:45,965
too dangerous to go in and fight the fire and it's just not worth it.

195
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,590
Um, like there was a chemical plant fire here and the fire horns like, yep. Stay back.

196
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,140
-- Right. Yeah,
-- that's what we're doing.

197
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:54,119
And, and so this is, I mean,

198
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:58,159
this is one of the many things we can talk about is the fact that today

199
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,239
the fire departments have,

200
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,419
they, they have well defined procedures of what to do when there's a fire,

201
00:09:04,429 --> 00:09:06,900
obviously get the people out is basically number one, right?

202
00:09:06,909 --> 00:09:07,630
Save lives.

203
00:09:08,109 --> 00:09:09,330
And then after that,

204
00:09:09,469 --> 00:09:11,760
for example, like, I know with Notre Dame,

205
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:15,489
uh getting stuff out they could save was kind of like number two.

206
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,849
Right. Let's get the, the art out and the relics and all that kind of stuff.

207
00:09:18,979 --> 00:09:22,039
And then let's worry about the structure itself and

208
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,150
it's, I mean, this old building that burnt down,

209
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:28,390
it was obviously the people all got out and then the fire department, they,

210
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,429
they said they wouldn't even go in because it was, they,

211
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,750
they knew it was coming down and they basically just started spraying water

212
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,789
on the next building over to make sure it didn't fall down.

213
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:38,429
Which is

214
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:41,590
like, so let's think about this in the context of security. Right?

215
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:46,159
Today, is there any procedure if you think something is going wrong? Right.

216
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:46,919
Basically.

217
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:50,840
-- No, it's kind of crazy town like
-- literally, you know,

218
00:09:50,849 --> 00:09:53,940
some of the best I've seen is you turn it off and start doing forensics on it.

219
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:54,549
But that,

220
00:09:54,729 --> 00:09:55,859
you know, if there's

221
00:09:56,349 --> 00:09:59,909
the false alarm cost of that kind of activity is very high.

222
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,900
Yeah, like we just start turning servers off and calling in forensics teams.

223
00:10:05,109 --> 00:10:06,770
Uh, a couple 100 bucks an hour.

224
00:10:07,669 --> 00:10:09,599
Yeah, that's going to

225
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,780
some yelling at the board level. Probably pretty quick.

226
00:10:12,849 --> 00:10:13,489
You're gonna be,

227
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,640
you're gonna be looking for a new job probably by the end of one or two of those,

228
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,659
you know, because the boy who cried wolf is not a popular person.

229
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:21,900
It's true. It's true.

230
00:10:21,909 --> 00:10:26,900
But anyway, anyway, so kind of resetting back to the, the good old days of your

231
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:31,489
is, I feel like that's kind of where we're at today in a lot of security.

232
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:33,169
And

233
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,789
it's similar, we have the private companies, you know,

234
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:38,090
you can buy your own private insurance, your own private, you can,

235
00:10:38,099 --> 00:10:40,520
you can pay security companies that will monitor your

236
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,590
network and your computers and if there's a problem,

237
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,250
supposedly, but you know, the, the, the

238
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,049
problem is sometimes they get hacked. You know, there was a recent one in Europe

239
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,849
where this high end provider got hacked.

240
00:10:51,979 --> 00:10:54,989
So, you know, well, that, that's not working out so well, maybe.

241
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,070
And, and they're basically kind of doing the same thing, which is, you know,

242
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,179
if you're paying us, we'll try and take care of you.

243
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,489
But,

244
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,169
you know, if we notice somebody else's house on fire, well,

245
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:04,609
they're not a paying customer so it's their problem.

246
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:06,530
But

247
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:07,049
it's,

248
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,450
so that's something that happened in, in like Victorian England

249
00:11:11,669 --> 00:11:14,650
is there were fire departments you could hire

250
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:16,169
and you kind of like it.

251
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:18,619
I, I would say put a sticker in your window, but goodness,

252
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,700
no stickers didn't exist back.

253
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,609
They actually would have grass plaques.

254
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,380
I know

255
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,409
in America

256
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:25,000
you would get a brass plaque that would

257
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,169
be on your building saying you're protected by

258
00:11:27,549 --> 00:11:28,840
whichever fire company.

259
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,760
Yep. Yep. And then

260
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:34,440
if your building started on fire, you'd obviously call them up and say, you know,

261
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,369
come, come help and they, they'd show up and do something.

262
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,440
Only if you're a customer. If you were a customer, they just stand

263
00:11:39,619 --> 00:11:41,969
-- there and watch it burn down.
-- And I know this happened in Ancient Rome.

264
00:11:41,979 --> 00:11:43,359
But what would happen at a fire is

265
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,479
they would show up and they'd offer to buy your building

266
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:47,099
that

267
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,349
heavily

268
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,520
discounted price,

269
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:52,159
right? And you know, you either get some money or no money and you know, as

270
00:11:52,289 --> 00:11:55,739
obviously as time goes on that number got small quick because they want to, you know,

271
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,059
get in there and knock the player down.

272
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,549
Um,

273
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,510
but then, you know,

274
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,039
we figured out that the negative externalities of fire are pretty bad and we,

275
00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:04,729
we organized it a bit better

276
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:07,809
and I think that's part of the problem with computer security is the, the,

277
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,520
the negative externalities

278
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:13,570
these companies largely get away with. Like, I mean, have I been pwned?

279
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,989
-- Has how many records? Seven?
-- Oh, my goodness.

280
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,049
The number, it's, it's, it's higher than that. I guarantee it.

281
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,530
It's, it's ridiculous

282
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:27,260
as of this 7.8 million billion, sorry, 7.8 billion

283
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,419
pound accounts.

284
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:34,549
Huh? I figured it was way more than that. Which don't get me wrong. That's still a lot.

285
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:35,440
Right. I mean,

286
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,080
how many people are on the planet? 9 billion?

287
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,289
And, and granted,

288
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,799
I know many people have multiple entries in there,

289
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:47,119
but still we're talking about a probably double digit portion of the population.

290
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:48,559
Yeah.

291
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,190
So that's the problem. Right.

292
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,330
I'm looking at this list of companies here listed as far as I know,

293
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:57,090
none of them have actually been dinged hard for, uh, for ending up there.

294
00:12:57,549 --> 00:13:01,049
Uh, no. And I don't think they will and, and that's an aspect of this.

295
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:04,570
I don't think we can necessarily correlate very well and I'm,

296
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,099
I'm comfortable kind of ignoring it.

297
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:09,450
So, anyway, let, let's fast forward a little bit in time. Right.

298
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:14,270
So you ended up in, in, like I said, kind of Victorian England where you had like,

299
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,210
fire departments you would pay and they would do their thing.

300
00:13:17,219 --> 00:13:18,650
And then eventually

301
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:23,090
you got kind of government funded fire departments, right,

302
00:13:23,099 --> 00:13:27,169
where they would kind of show up and, and work on people's property,

303
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:28,599
doing whatever they could

304
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:29,809
to deal with the fires.

305
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,530
And of course, I, I imagine part of this was the technology as well just because

306
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,830
kind of prior to having, you know, a pump and a hose,

307
00:13:36,989 --> 00:13:40,750
what you literally couldn't do anything. Right. There was very minimal.

308
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,369
Well, you not only need a pump and a hose, you need a water source.

309
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:46,049
Right. Right. But you got to figure most,

310
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,099
most cities have a river or something

311
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,789
nearby to most places.

312
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,299
Do me a favor.

313
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:58,539
-- Go transport one cubic meter of water a kilometer without using your car.
-- No,

314
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,460
in that case, totally not. I mean, I'll agree with you there.

315
00:14:01,469 --> 00:14:05,520
If, if there isn't a water source within a couple 100 ft, you're in trouble.

316
00:14:05,619 --> 00:14:07,940
My parents' cabin doesn't have running water and hauling

317
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,070
up enough water just for two days of like,

318
00:14:10,469 --> 00:14:13,940
you know, washcloth, washing and drinking and cooking

319
00:14:14,179 --> 00:14:16,159
is such a royal pain.

320
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,239
Yeah, I would,

321
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:22,440
I would drive a well because I guarantee that it is totally worth whatever it costs

322
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:23,489
guaranteed.

323
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,599
And so, you know, we,

324
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:29,650
we not even running and drinkable water but just even running water,

325
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:32,150
like because you don't need drinkable water to put out a fire, obviously,

326
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,989
but just running water and putting out a fire, like you need quite a bit of water.

327
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,150
It's ridiculous. So, in fact, this is, this is another thing

328
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:42,130
is

329
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,210
the, the building down the street for me.

330
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,419
Uh, it started on fire in the middle of the night and they had it out by morning.

331
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,900
It was smoking. Right.

332
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:53,419
And they came back for three days to spray water on it

333
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:57,570
because it just like they were obviously concerned there was going to be a flare up.

334
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,059
And then on like the fourth day we got a huge storm.

335
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,500
And so I'm, I'm assuming that put everything out.

336
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,020
But yeah, like that was, that was crazy to think about too is just

337
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:06,429
the fact that

338
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:10,080
like, like containing this was incredibly difficult.

339
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:13,859
And again, this, this made me think of computer security again where,

340
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,489
how many times have you heard of instances where people

341
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,679
thought they had the Attackers kicked out of the network?

342
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,119
And then it's like, oh, no, sure, didn't.

343
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:20,309
You know,

344
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,400
you forgot about that workstation way over there on the other side of the room

345
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:27,299
or that printer or that wireless access point or

346
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:30,609
those accounts that still exist and have bad passwords.

347
00:15:30,619 --> 00:15:31,960
And see that's, and that's part of the problem.

348
00:15:31,969 --> 00:15:33,840
I think that would be actually a good parallel is that

349
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,840
with computer security kind of incidents,

350
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:41,219
-- there's lots of embers waiting to flare up.
-- Yep. Yep. There are,

351
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:44,219
and worse than that, there's still the sort of the fuel load,

352
00:15:44,229 --> 00:15:47,809
there's still all those creaky systems that aren't well maintained and managed.

353
00:15:48,619 --> 00:15:49,299
Yep. Yep.

354
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,020
To catch fire basically.

355
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:51,580
Right.

356
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,690
And now I think this again is a place where

357
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,659
fire is easier because you'll generally have heat and smoke.

358
00:15:57,669 --> 00:16:01,179
Of course, you know, in the, in the context of, of computer security. Yeah.

359
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:05,020
Well, not always because, I mean, there's been some crazy, like, I,

360
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,559
I remember last summer there was,

361
00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:08,099
for example, somebody,

362
00:16:08,109 --> 00:16:11,260
their house almost burned down the fire started on their deck and,

363
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,030
you know what it was?

364
00:16:12,109 --> 00:16:15,500
It was a cardboard box full of oily rigs that auto ignited

365
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:16,989
just out in the sun.

366
00:16:17,849 --> 00:16:20,309
Yeah, apparently that's possible. I would not have guessed that.

367
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,750
Like, straight up a guy was working in his garage,

368
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,150
you know? And so, like,

369
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:28,000
it's similar to that and that, you know,

370
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:31,510
there's so many things where just these computer systems can be.

371
00:16:31,849 --> 00:16:34,280
Well, let me put it this way. How many of us have met,

372
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,309
you know, good penetration testers that have never failed.

373
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:41,630
Uh, I don't, I think bad penetration testers never fail

374
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:42,369
blake,

375
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,909
but, I mean, good penetration testers always get in.

376
00:16:45,989 --> 00:16:47,330
Yeah. Right. Guaranteed,

377
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,210
guaranteed.

378
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,859
Even bad ones usually get in, we'll say. Right.

379
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,789
Yeah. So,

380
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:54,890
no, I mean, and that's like, that's actually something I'm currently doing,

381
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,820
you know, I've been doing an, it inventory,

382
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,159
uh,

383
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:01,659
partly to get rid of some old systems that just don't have the capabilities we want,

384
00:17:01,669 --> 00:17:03,760
but also to get rid of some old systems.

385
00:17:03,979 --> 00:17:05,848
Right. Right. And that's a great idea.

386
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,010
I mean, that's like removing the oily rags of your network. Right.

387
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,969
Put them outside on the deck. It'll be fine.

388
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,489
Put them in the neighbor's yard. Right. It'll be ok.

389
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:15,688
That's right. That's

390
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:15,958
right.

391
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,088
You know, so, I'm trying to get rid of, you know,

392
00:17:18,098 --> 00:17:20,208
I'm trying to get rid of problems before they become a problem.

393
00:17:20,218 --> 00:17:21,838
But fundamentally,

394
00:17:22,489 --> 00:17:25,029
you know, it, it's tough because it's, it's a lot of different aspects.

395
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:27,828
It's, it's kind of like forest fires. Right. You got to do forest management

396
00:17:28,138 --> 00:17:31,159
and even if you do forest management, you're still going to have forest fires.

397
00:17:31,369 --> 00:17:32,548
Yep. Yep. That's right.

398
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,948
And, and like, again,

399
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,109
these are things we've had thousands of years of

400
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:37,979
experience with and they're still hard to get.

401
00:17:37,989 --> 00:17:38,348
Right.

402
00:17:38,589 --> 00:17:39,849
And I would even argue it's,

403
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:46,050
it's probably magnitudes less difficult and complex than a lot of computing today,

404
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,010
which I mean,

405
00:17:47,189 --> 00:17:48,969
is, it, is what it is. Right.

406
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:53,339
So, ok, so, anyway, I want to fast forward a little bit now to, we say more modern

407
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,280
age with fire right

408
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:00,579
now. First of all, in, in nearly every building today.

409
00:18:00,589 --> 00:18:03,869
Well, I, I think in every building you're supposed to have smoke detectors. Right.

410
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,739
Everywhere you are

411
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:05,770
smoking.

412
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:07,930
Right. Right.

413
00:18:07,939 --> 00:18:11,209
Which, in fact, I don't know if carbon monoxide, I think you only need those in

414
00:18:11,979 --> 00:18:12,290
areas.

415
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:13,479
I know.

416
00:18:13,489 --> 00:18:17,430
Well, I, here they generally recommend that you put a carbon monoxide detector,

417
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:19,430
you know, in your basement with your furnace and stuff

418
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,619
because that's the thing that's most likely to cause carbon monoxide.

419
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:24,819
Well, in your water heater, if it's gas

420
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:25,969
powered water heater. So,

421
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:30,750
so actually I have a funny story about that is I had my house wired with the, like,

422
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,979
smoke alarms that are all interconnected

423
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:36,650
-- and no, they're awesome. I love them.
-- Oh, no, I know. I love them too until they go off.

424
00:18:37,189 --> 00:18:38,349
Yeah. Yes, that is true.

425
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,750
But it's, it's cool.

426
00:18:40,614 --> 00:18:42,194
Uh, I tell, I tell the electrician, I said,

427
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:45,045
I want you to put one of the carbon monoxide ones right above the furnace.

428
00:18:45,055 --> 00:18:46,584
He's like, well, you don't legally have to do that.

429
00:18:46,594 --> 00:18:48,265
And I looked, and I'm like, I don't care

430
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:48,795
what

431
00:18:48,944 --> 00:18:51,005
the attitude is that right? Like,

432
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,864
if there is a fire or carbon monoxide problem,

433
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:58,984
there is probably an 80% chance it's going to occur within 5 ft of this thing.

434
00:18:58,994 --> 00:19:03,005
-- Like, put it there.
-- Like, I have cheap smoke alarms all over my house

435
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:07,305
and I have two high end nest smoke alarms, one by the furnace and one in the kitchen.

436
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:09,699
Right. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly.

437
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,939
Because like, that's where all the fire is in my house.

438
00:19:12,209 --> 00:19:14,329
Yep. Yep. Although I will say the downfall.

439
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:16,770
Yeah, you said about the, the, when they're all linked together.

440
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,449
Yeah. When we, when we burn something in the oven.

441
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:19,910
Uh,

442
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:20,500
yeah,

443
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:23,650
the whole house is crazy and you basically just have to

444
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,780
exit the house for the most part because it's so loud,

445
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,900
you can't go anywhere in the house without hurting your ears.

446
00:19:29,089 --> 00:19:29,819
Which, but again,

447
00:19:29,989 --> 00:19:32,979
that's a feature in all seriousness. And that's an example of

448
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,459
if they go off too often,

449
00:19:34,469 --> 00:19:36,530
you get your alarm fatigue and I'm going to be inclined

450
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,619
to disable them and that obviously completely defeats the purpose.

451
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:39,869
So,

452
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:43,150
in fairness though, smoke alarms are quite

453
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:47,180
reliable nowadays, like, yeah, they'll go off, you burn stuff in the kitchen and,

454
00:19:47,189 --> 00:19:48,339
and feed smoke into them.

455
00:19:48,349 --> 00:19:50,199
But that's like what they're supposed to do.

456
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:50,550
So

457
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:52,359
stop burning dinner, I guess.

458
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:55,369
I haven't done it in a while, but I,

459
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,260
I will also say it's generally my fault when it happens.

460
00:19:58,689 --> 00:20:01,020
I won't blame anyone else. It's, it's totally me.

461
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:04,880
Um, but anyway, ok, so we got, you know, kind of that, that's part of the detection,

462
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,910
right, of having things like smoke alarms.

463
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,050
And obviously my assumption is in the fire down the street for me,

464
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:12,959
everyone probably got out because of smoke alarms.

465
00:20:12,969 --> 00:20:17,530
I, I would be shocked if that isn't the reason everyone exited the building safely.

466
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,770
And also

467
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,290
what I've noticed is with, with

468
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:26,229
alarms going off, especially in sort of, if it's a place that, you know,

469
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,709
people tend to kind of either know that they have to

470
00:20:28,719 --> 00:20:30,880
leave or know where to go check for an actual fire,

471
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,670
like your house or your place of work.

472
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,040
Right.

473
00:20:33,449 --> 00:20:37,250
Or they'll leave or, you know, schools are pretty good about mandatory evacuation.

474
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,760
But what I've really noticed in places where

475
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:42,839
it's a transient space. So a great example is the mall.

476
00:20:42,849 --> 00:20:43,800
We were at the mall one day and the,

477
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:46,180
and the fire alarms going off and we're just like, well,

478
00:20:46,189 --> 00:20:48,660
nobody's running and the security guard doesn't look worried and

479
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:52,030
the, the fire alarm seems to be coming from this store over here.

480
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,189
So, ok, I guess we keep shopping.

481
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:57,329
Right. And same thing I've noticed in hotels,

482
00:20:57,859 --> 00:20:59,489
you know where in a hotel, like,

483
00:20:59,729 --> 00:21:02,089
yeah, good luck getting people to evacuate a hotel at two in the morning.

484
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:05,050
-- It's like I'm gonna just put another pillow on my ear.
-- I have no doubt.

485
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,550
II, I can't even imagine. All right. So, anyway, anyway, uh, right.

486
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,689
We've got our detection

487
00:21:10,109 --> 00:21:11,170
kind of aspect.

488
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,880
But what I would say is once people hear somebody screaming and shouting fire,

489
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:14,650
guess what they do?

490
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:15,660
Well,

491
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:16,670
so,

492
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,640
so, so let's move on. This is

493
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,160
-- a
-- computer security. What do people do when they say we've been hacked?

494
00:21:21,589 --> 00:21:24,719
-- Uh
-- Right. And that, so that's exactly the question is

495
00:21:24,969 --> 00:21:26,140
if, if there's a fire,

496
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,680
the fire department shows up and you

497
00:21:27,689 --> 00:21:30,510
have trained professionals that are basically from

498
00:21:30,849 --> 00:21:32,000
a, a non

499
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:35,189
private entity. Right? These are essentially public servants,

500
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:40,030
they show up, they assess the situation and then they take whatever action they deem

501
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:43,890
is appropriate. And sometimes it's save the building next to it.

502
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,130
Sometimes it's saved the people in the building. Sometimes it's put out the fire.

503
00:21:47,235 --> 00:21:47,495
You know,

504
00:21:47,505 --> 00:21:49,125
there's a million things that can happen

505
00:21:49,135 --> 00:21:51,725
and like these people are insanely trained.

506
00:21:51,735 --> 00:21:54,576
My neighbor is actually one of the fire chiefs, which is, I also,

507
00:21:54,586 --> 00:21:57,115
I get a lot of dirt on what's going on in the city, which is fun too.

508
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,156
But like this guy,

509
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,036
I've talked to him at length about kind of

510
00:22:00,046 --> 00:22:01,745
what they do and how they train and everything.

511
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:02,135
And the,

512
00:22:02,265 --> 00:22:05,365
like this guy has been in the industry for probably 40 years

513
00:22:05,505 --> 00:22:09,306
and he's still constantly taking training every year all the time.

514
00:22:09,501 --> 00:22:10,881
There's so much he needs to do.

515
00:22:10,891 --> 00:22:13,312
And I just keep thinking, we, we don't, I mean,

516
00:22:13,322 --> 00:22:16,641
even if you wanted to take yearly training, is there yearly training?

517
00:22:16,651 --> 00:22:17,842
You know what I mean? It's

518
00:22:18,842 --> 00:22:19,171
lack

519
00:22:19,812 --> 00:22:19,942
of

520
00:22:20,052 --> 00:22:21,001
professionalism.

521
00:22:21,121 --> 00:22:21,141
Yeah.

522
00:22:21,531 --> 00:22:24,881
Well, we, we, we definitely lack a formalized version of it.

523
00:22:25,232 --> 00:22:28,761
Um And this, you know, this is obviously something the CS A is working on, you know,

524
00:22:28,771 --> 00:22:31,631
like top 10 threats, for example, or,

525
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:32,469
you know,

526
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:36,939
new strategies around software defined perimeter and zero trust network,

527
00:22:36,949 --> 00:22:39,510
you know, new technologies, new techniques that you can use.

528
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,130
Um And obviously this is,

529
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,500
this is actually entirely what I'm working on with the open C PE stuff is,

530
00:22:44,699 --> 00:22:45,030
you know,

531
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,390
allowing people to measure sort of more nontraditional

532
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,930
training so that they can show like,

533
00:22:49,939 --> 00:22:51,180
look, I, I do care.

534
00:22:51,189 --> 00:22:51,569
And I,

535
00:22:51,989 --> 00:22:52,770
you know, for example,

536
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:56,069
I take the Sans Holiday capture the flag challenge every year and I complete it to,

537
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:56,660
you know, keep my

538
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,540
like to keep

539
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:58,969
in practice and

540
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:00,699
learning new techniques. And so,

541
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:04,819
and, and that's one of the things I'm I'm trying to do is to create, you know,

542
00:23:04,829 --> 00:23:06,390
it's kind of a chicken and egg problem is

543
00:23:06,699 --> 00:23:10,369
a lot of places offer actually pretty decent training courses and stuff. But

544
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,130
as a whole industry do we have like really good stuff? Not as much as we need.

545
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:15,859
Why?

546
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:17,660
Well, because it's really hard to measure and,

547
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:21,150
and claim in a way that allows you to then leverage it and like

548
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,739
up your game and, you know, have a, have a better job or, or make more money at your job.

549
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,099
So

550
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,170
there's,

551
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,170
well, there's very few incentives to put that work in.

552
00:23:30,689 --> 00:23:34,349
Um And so not a lot of people do, like, a lot of people do, like,

553
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:36,569
you look at the open source world or, you know, like,

554
00:23:37,189 --> 00:23:39,439
you know, the guy running have I been ped or,

555
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:43,130
you know, Tavis Ormandy who's been worryingly quiet in the last few months.

556
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,089
Um,

557
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:45,449
you know, but like they,

558
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:48,640
there are clearly people who are working very hard to improve

559
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:51,369
the industry and to not only improve themselves but to make it

560
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,810
possible for other people to improve themselves.

561
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:59,410
Right? Ok. And and you actually just hit on the thing I was trying to go to next is

562
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:04,880
yes, we have people who are phenomenal in their own special way. But

563
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,650
the, the, if you look at the history of firefighting,

564
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:10,719
they have a way to transfer the knowledge into the

565
00:24:10,729 --> 00:24:13,670
future where every time there is something that goes wrong,

566
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,520
they can learn lessons and make changes.

567
00:24:15,979 --> 00:24:17,890
We can't do that today.

568
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,689
We have very smart people that they're,

569
00:24:20,699 --> 00:24:25,010
they're an island of knowledge and transferring that knowledge out is I'm

570
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,319
not going to say it's even possible because it may not be,

571
00:24:27,329 --> 00:24:27,930
I don't know.

572
00:24:27,939 --> 00:24:32,869
But the point is we lack that ability to empower the next generation in front of us.

573
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,349
Right. We're all kind of mired in the same pit.

574
00:24:35,859 --> 00:24:39,609
Yeah. The number of people I see making the same mistakes. It's like,

575
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:42,469
yeah, that's the thing we discovered 20 years ago.

576
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:45,069
Right. Right. Exactly.

577
00:24:45,329 --> 00:24:46,069
And then we,

578
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,400
we forgot about it because it kind of went away for a while.

579
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,709
Right. And I don't,

580
00:24:49,819 --> 00:24:54,180
that's one, I don't know if we can necessarily fix it. It is.

581
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,319
Although it's also possible, uh, you know,

582
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:59,209
200 years ago there were people fighting fires that were like, oh,

583
00:24:59,219 --> 00:25:00,819
I can't teach someone how to do this.

584
00:25:00,829 --> 00:25:01,939
It's too special.

585
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,229
I don't know about that. But it's, this is one of the problems that

586
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,310
we have to solve that because

587
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,500
if we can't look at what happened,

588
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,660
learn lessons and make sure we don't make the same mistakes again.

589
00:25:14,989 --> 00:25:18,589
I, I, all you're gonna do is keep going around and around and around.

590
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,890
Well, see there's a, there's a good comment you make learning from our mistakes.

591
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,719
So how many places do post post mortems?

592
00:25:25,339 --> 00:25:29,359
Let alone how many places do post mortems on a somewhat regular basis?

593
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:33,140
Like when they don't need to like beyond, oh, something horrible happened now,

594
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:37,010
we have to do a postmortem because the lawyers are, you know, asking us to.

595
00:25:37,219 --> 00:25:39,459
And so actually one thing on my team at the CS A,

596
00:25:39,869 --> 00:25:44,390
we are making it a habit of doing regular post mortems, both success,

597
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,579
failure and just

598
00:25:45,709 --> 00:25:48,589
as a regular occurrence so that we get better at

599
00:25:48,699 --> 00:25:51,680
-- it.
-- I would bet you most places do postmortems.

600
00:25:51,689 --> 00:25:55,500
But I would also argue we, we aren't learning the lessons we need to.

601
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,189
But even more importantly

602
00:25:57,339 --> 00:25:59,819
is if you do a post mortem at the CS A,

603
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,699
I have no idea what lessons you learned,

604
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:03,150
right? Whereas

605
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,729
firefighting, this is information is

606
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:06,900
on

607
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:07,290
my

608
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,069
team where we're actually building stuff.

609
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:12,939
And so some of it we will share externally, but some of it's internal to us, like

610
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:17,479
for example, um we discovered that we should have

611
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:22,849
essentially made um some decisions differently or more early, right?

612
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:26,489
And so we're, we're now we're a bit less afraid of making these called shots

613
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,099
because we are actually capable of failing fast, you know,

614
00:26:30,109 --> 00:26:32,069
and actually recovering from, ok.

615
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:34,239
If we make the wrong decision, we can actually fix this.

616
00:26:34,689 --> 00:26:37,500
Um as far as the post mortems and

617
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,660
uh letting others learn from it. One of my plans is to then

618
00:26:41,939 --> 00:26:45,020
formalize this postmortem process and, you know,

619
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,780
write an entry about it and publish it,

620
00:26:47,589 --> 00:26:51,500
you know, which forces me to make it more real and more structured, right? And,

621
00:26:51,619 --> 00:26:53,449
and, you know, it's like, well,

622
00:26:53,459 --> 00:26:56,930
I guess Docker currently is the one that's kind of the, the whipping boy for,

623
00:26:56,939 --> 00:26:57,079
you know,

624
00:26:57,089 --> 00:27:00,880
they had that incident where a quote non-financial database was breached.

625
00:27:01,109 --> 00:27:04,650
And I'm like, I've never heard that phrase before. That makes me very nervous.

626
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,689
And Docker has been horrible

627
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:12,420
on communicating what all has happened. Whereas there's been other places with

628
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,689
like, yeah, we got breached and like, here's the, you know, like cloud flare,

629
00:27:15,699 --> 00:27:19,699
they write up of the thing Tavis Ormandy found is really

630
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:20,729
good.

631
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:22,199
You've led me

632
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:27,130
right into where I wanted to kind of end up on this whole conversation

633
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:32,119
is so the building that burned down down the street for me, it was a total loss

634
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:35,569
and they figure it's about $8 million worth of damage.

635
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:38,310
Right. Yeah, that's, that's rough. Definitely. That's,

636
00:27:38,719 --> 00:27:39,410
but anyway.

637
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:41,650
Right. Yeah, exactly.

638
00:27:41,849 --> 00:27:47,050
So, anyway, because it is such a high amount, it's a high dollar amount of loss.

639
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:47,910
They,

640
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,550
they're bringing in the state fire inspector to kind of do the work and

641
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:55,510
write up the report and that I'm thinking also like first of all,

642
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:58,349
we don't have professionals to bring in to help deal with

643
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:01,229
the situation and then help us with a post mortem.

644
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,069
But more importantly is like in this case,

645
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:06,540
the professionals even have a more professional group,

646
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:10,270
they can call upon for even more help because they're like we can't do this.

647
00:28:10,353 --> 00:28:12,792
We need someone bigger than us,

648
00:28:12,953 --> 00:28:17,213
right? Like that, my my brain exploded. I thought this is amazing.

649
00:28:17,223 --> 00:28:18,572
Like, just think about that.

650
00:28:18,583 --> 00:28:22,253
If you had say three levels of people, you could ask for help for,

651
00:28:22,262 --> 00:28:24,093
because the problem was so big

652
00:28:24,322 --> 00:28:25,983
that you knew you couldn't deal with it.

653
00:28:26,032 --> 00:28:27,682
-- Well, and
-- also so like with air crashes,

654
00:28:27,692 --> 00:28:30,853
the problem is so it's really important to understand these problems

655
00:28:30,863 --> 00:28:33,083
and make sure they don't happen again and again and again.

656
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:36,595
-- Same thing. Exactly. Exactly. The same
-- thing.

657
00:28:36,956 --> 00:28:37,845
Yeah, I don't know. I, I

658
00:28:37,965 --> 00:28:38,576
think,

659
00:28:38,586 --> 00:28:40,686
and I can't help but think one of the challenges

660
00:28:40,696 --> 00:28:43,436
is that the industry is constantly changing so much.

661
00:28:43,446 --> 00:28:43,715
So,

662
00:28:43,906 --> 00:28:48,656
for example, the CS A, as far as I know, we have three pieces of on premises equipment,

663
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:51,475
we have three offices that have a wireless access point.

664
00:28:51,485 --> 00:28:53,786
And then I think also one or two of them have a printer

665
00:28:53,975 --> 00:28:56,316
and that is the extent of our on premise networking,

666
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:00,449
right? So the problems I face from a security perspective are

667
00:29:00,569 --> 00:29:02,400
100% different

668
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:03,410
than,

669
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:05,520
well, actually the majority of the industry, you know,

670
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:08,640
it's funny because I keep having people approach me and try and sell me stuff

671
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:13,030
-- and it's like I, I don't have a network or servers.
-- Ok. So

672
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,130
I thought of this too actually.

673
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:18,969
Is you, you brought up? Exactly. One of the things I was thinking about in my brain a

674
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:21,810
couple of days ago is that you could say, oh, but

675
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,270
my network is special or my infrastructure is special or whatever.

676
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:26,369
But here's the thing

677
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,160
is

678
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,030
when the fire department shows up,

679
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,810
they have no idea what they're going to be dealing with. Right.

680
00:29:31,819 --> 00:29:35,530
-- What is the building made of, what is inside of it?
-- That's not true.

681
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:36,770
Uh For example, if,

682
00:29:37,094 --> 00:29:40,545
if there's something especially dangerous that should be listed,

683
00:29:40,704 --> 00:29:44,594
you know, there's, there's registries of places that have chemicals and have

684
00:29:44,714 --> 00:29:47,604
these dangerous materials. You know, they have the warning signs up.

685
00:29:47,824 --> 00:29:50,125
Well, and that's incredibly dangerous.

686
00:29:50,135 --> 00:29:53,194
But I'm just saying from the perspective of you show up at a building,

687
00:29:53,204 --> 00:29:54,364
how many rooms are there?

688
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,755
How many people are there? What's it made of? Right.

689
00:29:56,765 --> 00:30:00,084
There's, there's all these unknowns the fire department already has

690
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,640
and like these guys are trained

691
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:06,020
to assess the situation very, very quickly.

692
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:08,439
And in fact, this is part of their training is

693
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,510
kind of, there's,

694
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,869
they show up and one of the first things they do is they'll like

695
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,369
go cut holes in places and they'll basically do as much as they can

696
00:30:16,589 --> 00:30:19,609
to make it easier for them to understand what's happening, right?

697
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:20,630
Like that's step one,

698
00:30:20,969 --> 00:30:24,089
then they figure out what's going on and then they deal with it, right?

699
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,150
Like that's,

700
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:26,829
that's huge, man.

701
00:30:27,219 --> 00:30:30,920
For example, reading the uh to talk about like an it fire, you know,

702
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,420
the Equifax hack where they had that really nice 80 or 90

703
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:36,670
page congressional report on it which I read and made notes on

704
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:38,859
one thing, for example,

705
00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:40,750
is they had a scanner on the system to

706
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,229
scan the software that should have caught the software

707
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:46,040
except they didn't, like, enable a recursive flake.

708
00:30:46,199 --> 00:30:48,209
So the software was sitting in a directory

709
00:30:48,339 --> 00:30:49,530
that didn't get scanned.

710
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:51,300
And so again, I,

711
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,920
I hate to harp on this but how many places

712
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:56,219
don't even know inventory wise what their it is.

713
00:30:56,410 --> 00:31:00,410
And that's assuming just on premises. Right. That's just assuming on premises.

714
00:31:00,449 --> 00:31:01,310
Exactly. The answer

715
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,439
is all of them.

716
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:03,859
Um,

717
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:05,469
you know,

718
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:08,300
and then there's also shadow it and there's all these other things

719
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,630
that can happen where you just don't know what's going on.

720
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:12,930
And so again, I think part of the challenge is,

721
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:16,569
is at least with the physical world we have some bounding and some constraints,

722
00:31:16,729 --> 00:31:17,199
you know.

723
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,469
Um, and that's not always well, and, and, but it can,

724
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:21,810
even in a building fire situation,

725
00:31:21,819 --> 00:31:24,020
it can get complicated like the fire can be

726
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:26,489
inside the walls or somewhere that's not as visible.

727
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:26,750
But,

728
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,989
yeah, like you said, the fire department has,

729
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,969
well, they've encountered this before.

730
00:31:30,979 --> 00:31:34,189
So they punch holes in the walls and, like, stick their nose in and see what's there.

731
00:31:34,199 --> 00:31:35,589
Exactly.

732
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,900
And so

733
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:40,130
with it, I think about, like, how many places

734
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:42,369
let me put it this way if I gave you

735
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:43,290
a

736
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,560
$10 million to go audit, like, and not audit from security point of view,

737
00:31:47,569 --> 00:31:49,520
but audit from like, what exists point of view?

738
00:31:49,739 --> 00:31:51,199
A fortune 100 company.

739
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:55,040
How confident would you be that you could get more than 99% of all the stuff they have?

740
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,569
Uh I'd be impressed if I got 50% of it. That

741
00:31:58,770 --> 00:31:59,199
price.

742
00:32:00,109 --> 00:32:00,459
Right.

743
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:05,380
Yeah. And that includes a generous allotment for booze at the end of every day.

744
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:05,979
Right?

745
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,569
For both bribes and sorrow.

746
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,459
That's right.

747
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:12,290
No, I mean, I don't disagree with you.

748
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,180
I think there's a certain amount of complexity, but I also feel like

749
00:32:15,689 --> 00:32:18,939
this is part of the challenge is how do we start unpacking

750
00:32:18,949 --> 00:32:20,689
a lot of this and how do we make it a science?

751
00:32:20,699 --> 00:32:21,550
Because

752
00:32:21,719 --> 00:32:27,089
I feel like security isn't a science. Security is like it's chicken bones and dice.

753
00:32:27,099 --> 00:32:29,579
We're not even at cargo cult stages yet.

754
00:32:29,589 --> 00:32:33,150
Like we don't even know what outcome we want by and large.

755
00:32:33,209 --> 00:32:36,410
I, I won't disagree with that and, and so I don't know, I just,

756
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,069
I keep thinking about this and

757
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:41,869
here's how I'm going to end this without my not, you know,

758
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,430
obviously it sounds dire at the moment,

759
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:45,150
but

760
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:49,630
I feel like this is probably growing pains of every industry.

761
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,589
Now, I'm gonna hope it doesn't take us 2000 years

762
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:55,939
to get there because that would be bad.

763
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:59,430
But I think this is part of the challenge and now

764
00:32:59,439 --> 00:33:02,760
I think the kind of call to action for everybody is our

765
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:06,709
jobs aren't really security in a lot of instances.

766
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:11,750
It's, it's, let's build the science of security. Right. How do we,

767
00:33:12,089 --> 00:33:14,390
how do we make all this reproducible and how do we

768
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,109
make it so we can transfer knowledge to the next generation?

769
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:20,290
-- Those are the things we really need to do.
-- Well, not even reproducible.

770
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,670
How do we start measuring this?

771
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,939
How do we know what works? Doesn't work?

772
00:33:23,949 --> 00:33:27,599
How do we know what skills we apply are, are valuable, you know,

773
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:29,800
and that's what I'm working on, you know, trying to figure that out.

774
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,770
No, I, I agree. I agree completely.

775
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,239
I think,

776
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,760
I think those are really important things and those

777
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:38,150
honestly are more important to the industry than,

778
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,900
than building the next new technology because even

779
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,560
if you build the next new technology,

780
00:33:42,569 --> 00:33:46,239
if we can't transfer analogy, we don't know what we're doing it, it doesn't matter.

781
00:33:46,349 --> 00:33:47,040
Well, we're just doomed,

782
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,400
recreate the, the mistakes of the past.

783
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,989
That too. Let's, let's invent another firewall. We'll call it something new.

784
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,800
Uh All right. Anyway, I'm calling it, man. Thank you, Kurt.

785
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:58,949
Thank you everyone for listening. You can go to open social security podcast.com.

786
00:33:58,959 --> 00:34:01,209
Hit up. I don't think we have any show notes today, but we'll see.

787
00:34:01,219 --> 00:34:03,979
I might, I might come up with some during the editing and you can e pound to

788
00:34:04,089 --> 00:34:07,089
as podcast hashtag to hit us up on social media. Kurt.

789
00:34:07,099 --> 00:34:10,489
-- Have a fantastic rest of your day.
-- You too. Thanks everybody.

790
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:11,820
-- Thanks.
-- Bye bye.
