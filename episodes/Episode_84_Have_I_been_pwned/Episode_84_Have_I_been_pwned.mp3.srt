Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 84 with myself,

1
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:12,510
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:16,158
So, the question for you today, Kurt is, have you been pawned?

3
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,110
I checked and the answer is no,

4
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:23,120
-- sure it is.
-- I

5
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:24,000
also made my partner

6
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:24,309
the

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,510
answer is yes.

8
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:27,309
Unquestionably. Right.

9
00:00:27,909 --> 00:00:29,200
-- Oh,
-- no, I've definitely,

10
00:00:29,209 --> 00:00:32,200
I've had several notifications from them but nothing important.

11
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,540
Oh, that's right. You have, you signed up for their service, didn't you?

12
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:36,790
I think you signed me up too

13
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,459
-- if I remember correctly.
-- Right.

14
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:41,389
So,

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,229
the topic of the day, I guess is there's a website called, have I been Pawned?

16
00:00:46,669 --> 00:00:50,630
And you can go to it? And basically there's a security researcher named Troy Hunt

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,310
who collects

18
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:57,900
lots of information from data leaks when someone gets hacked and it gets dumped

19
00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:00,599
on paste spin or the dark web or whatever you want to call it.

20
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:04,500
He collects it and he puts it all together and he very

21
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:09,099
recently put out what we'll call version two of his password list

22
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:15,819
and it is 500 million passwords in this list. It's a 20 gigabyte list.

23
00:01:16,139 --> 00:01:17,500
It's even better than that.

24
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,339
-- It's also how common they are.
-- Yeah.

25
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:20,269
-- Which is super
-- cool.

26
00:01:20,279 --> 00:01:23,879
Actually, I, I remember I pulled it down and I took a peek at it quick with,

27
00:01:23,889 --> 00:01:26,319
with human eyes because it's, it's a text file

28
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:32,720
and the number one password was like 20 million uses was 123456. And then it, it's

29
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:38,129
very parabolic after that where it drops to like 6 million after 20 million.

30
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,680
Well, I would assume a pert

31
00:01:39,889 --> 00:01:41,209
of distribution, you know, like

32
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:41,680
a

33
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,190
state

34
00:01:43,199 --> 00:01:45,610
and then obviously there's like, I think, I want to say,

35
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:50,319
I read some things from Troy and it's like, 16 million passwords are only used once,

36
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,010
which is,

37
00:01:51,489 --> 00:01:54,169
-- that's lower than I would expect.
-- But

38
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,410
I'm not super surprised because people will,

39
00:01:57,419 --> 00:01:59,260
especially people that have been taught, you know, swapping

40
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,489
e for a three, whatever like that. Right.

41
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,389
Um, and most people will do sort of what

42
00:02:05,769 --> 00:02:07,870
the minimum is to get their password accepted. Right.

43
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:11,139
So, I've been to way too many sites where it's like they, they pick some random,

44
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:13,039
almost always even number.

45
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,490
Like your password must be at least eight characters long or

46
00:02:16,029 --> 00:02:17,669
10 or 12 or whatever.

47
00:02:18,059 --> 00:02:20,570
I don't think I've ever seen an odd number minimum.

48
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:25,710
And then they're like, and it must contain at least one of the following. Right.

49
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,179
Like, you know, uh, what is it, a number, a capital and a special character?

50
00:02:30,649 --> 00:02:31,600
And that's really, yeah,

51
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,580
that's really pretty much all the utmost they ever ask for because beyond a letter,

52
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:37,169
a number and a special character.

53
00:02:37,179 --> 00:02:38,270
Oh, I guess emojis.

54
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:38,979
But, yeah,

55
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,149
haven't seen that yet.

56
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:42,630
Oh, speaking of which are there any emojis in there or what,

57
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:45,139
what format is the password f just to ask you text or?

58
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:49,229
Ok. So what, what Troy has distributed is

59
00:02:49,429 --> 00:02:50,139
he sha

60
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:50,660
one

61
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:55,830
all of the passwords. And so obviously the password field is of uniform length

62
00:02:56,419 --> 00:03:01,119
and then there's a colon and then there is a number and the

63
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:05,160
number is the number of times that particular password has been seen.

64
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:06,000
And

65
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,660
I understand why he did this because you don't want.

66
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:13,419
-- Yeah. So he doesn't get sued.
-- Well, maybe I, that, that could be

67
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,470
and I think there's something to be said about not

68
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,910
handing out like the greatest rainbow table in history.

69
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,100
-- Right.
-- True. Yeah. Well, and realistically the bad guys have

70
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,059
already, I mean, no offense, but it's not like he

71
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:30,860
spent millions of dollars and time and effort assembling this list.

72
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:33,339
Like he definitely spent quite a bit of time and effort assembling this list,

73
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,020
but it's all

74
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,850
free stuff. Yes.

75
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,820
Right. Like he's not buying password list on the dark web.

76
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:41,259
He's just,

77
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,429
he's not,

78
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,910
I know he spends some of his own money and obviously his time.

79
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:46,309
Well,

80
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,080
more to the point if like government and

81
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:50,149
state actors don't have an intern doing this.

82
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,550
They do now.

83
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,669
Yes.

84
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,990
Yes, indeed.

85
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:58,830
Well, and I think there's some some additional interesting tidbits to this is so

86
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,729
it's a single sha one

87
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:06,100
and that means you can reverse this without tons of effort

88
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,440
in, in many instances, like to give you an example.

89
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:08,669
So I,

90
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:11,110
I've got the database and I'm currently loading it into

91
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:13,539
elastic search because that'll let me search it quickly.

92
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:19,079
And what I'm gonna do then is write an application to just like brute force, right?

93
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:20,089
Start with A,

94
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:21,450
then B and,

95
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,679
and just kind of see how long I can let it run till I get tired of it and see

96
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,320
how many passwords I get where all I have to do is generate a string and sha one it,

97
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:31,149
which is going to take milliseconds on a modern system.

98
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,489
Well, that's somebody already did that for, remember the, the NT land.

99
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:39,339
In fact, they have every NT Landman password has been crank.

100
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:43,589
We should, we should also specify for people who might not know a rainbow table is.

101
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:45,500
Well, ok, let's start over

102
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,140
you. You have

103
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,339
a, a password is typed into a box and most systems,

104
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:55,230
the good ones don't store the password,

105
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:58,220
they store a hash of the password where you take the password and

106
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,339
you do something to it to scramble it in an irreversible way.

107
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,940
And generally it's a very CPU intensive operation because let's face it.

108
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,799
You don't want the bad guys to be able to crack these passwords super fast,

109
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,119
which Troy did not do.

110
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,709
It's going to be easy to crack these essentially.

111
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,510
And that's what you're going to have to do is crack them. Right. There's no salt.

112
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,880
There's, well, brute force them. Yeah.

113
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,880
Well, brute force.

114
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,220
Yeah, that's probably more accurate,

115
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,160
which is fine because that's also not his intention.

116
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,589
Well, and the main thing is though, with,

117
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,570
well, and the other thing too is, is this is getting to the scale of, like,

118
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:29,910
the Yahoo breaches where,

119
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,510
when, you know, if you're just, like, basically

120
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,709
trawling, like, in fishing terms, you're just putting out a huge net and like, uh,

121
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,279
whatever we scoop up, we scoop up, right?

122
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,700
We're not picky about what we grab.

123
00:05:40,059 --> 00:05:44,250
So if, you know, like with the Yahoo or, you know, with, with some place where,

124
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,200
let's say you get

125
00:05:45,619 --> 00:05:48,200
1010 encrypted passwords, whatever.

126
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,720
But, you know,

127
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,059
if you get 100 million encrypted passwords and you don't really

128
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,440
care about which ones you do or do not crack,

129
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,519
then you can definitely get

130
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:54,709
a

131
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,190
percent of them because they'll have bad

132
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:57,299
questionably.

133
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,989
They'll have 123456.

134
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,829
And that's, I think part of the problem here is that we're, we're,

135
00:06:02,489 --> 00:06:06,000
I think we're back into that problem of large numbers where

136
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,230
a lot of security is based

137
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:13,910
on systems and principles that don't deal well with large numbers, right? Like

138
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:17,690
what Google does for account security versus what your ISP does,

139
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:19,570
you know.

140
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,089
And, and this is a great example of this like,

141
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,470
given even a minimal amount of cracking effort you're gonna find

142
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:32,070
-- tens or, well, not tens, hundreds of thousands of millions,
-- I think,

143
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,640
I think millions is more accurate.

144
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:38,470
And, and so the thing I keep thinking of here is it's kind of two fold,

145
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,630
first of all,

146
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,029
with half a billion

147
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,149
passwords

148
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:44,929
there is,

149
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,049
I think it's safe to say any human generated password is probably on this list.

150
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:49,809
Right.

151
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,369
I, actually, there's a bunch of that

152
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,890
-- were not that I was surprised about.
-- What do you mean?

153
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,350
Well, like I, uh what was it, password hard to,

154
00:06:58,779 --> 00:06:59,970
I think was not breached.

155
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:03,450
But that's, that's more of a passphrase at that point.

156
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:05,290
That's the other thing, right? Is that?

157
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,690
Yeah? Ok. Let's, let me, let me change my statement.

158
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,730
Let's say any human generated password of,

159
00:07:11,739 --> 00:07:15,750
we'll say 10 characters or less is almost certainly on this list.

160
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,529
Right. And, and I'm sure there are

161
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,250
passwords that are not,

162
00:07:21,059 --> 00:07:23,980
but I, I think it's safe to say human suck passwords.

163
00:07:23,989 --> 00:07:25,940
And, and this is unquestionably proof of it,

164
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:29,959
especially when you see 123456 use 20 million times.

165
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:33,529
Hang on one second. I'm trying to math in my head. I can't math in my head. So good

166
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:37,380
-- math is
-- hard. It's fine. It's super hard. Ok. What's uh uh

167
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:42,220
no, wait. Yeah. Ok. Hang on a sec. 83. Where's, where's the power button there? It is

168
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,720
uh 1.5 E 19

169
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,649
that's actually not an insurmountable number with a bunch of GP US.

170
00:07:48,109 --> 00:07:49,200
It, it is not.

171
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,850
So that is theoretically every

172
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,130
uh key on your keyboard on a standard.

173
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,869
Let me rephrase that every key on a standard like us,

174
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,989
one on one keyboard that like makes character.

175
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,529
So letters, numbers and symbols is uh I believe it's

176
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:05,359
about, yeah, 80

177
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:06,609
ish whatever.

178
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,989
Uh

179
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,950
52. Yeah, it's about 80 ish characters and 90 ish characters in total

180
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:14,049
10 to the, or to the power of 10.

181
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:16,329
Uh,

182
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,700
and actually,

183
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:19,390
it's funny because you actually reduce the search

184
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,500
base quite a lot by having password requirements.

185
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:26,070
Like, it must contain a letter, it must contain a pass or a symbol because

186
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:30,970
90% of those passwords that are going to have a bunch of letters with one of those.

187
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,500
Oh, exactly. And I wouldn't be surprised if you say a minimum of eight characters.

188
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,419
You've just made 75% of your passwords, eight characters.

189
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,330
Right? I mean, that's just how people are.

190
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:44,280
Well, I mean, I've dealt with sites where I, you know, I use a password,

191
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:47,400
like I use last pass which has a password generator and the sites like, nope,

192
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:47,820
too long.

193
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:51,260
And I'm like, really, like, 8 to 12 or 8 to 10.

194
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:52,770
And then I just assumed that they're actually

195
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,570
storing the raw password at that point.

196
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:58,270
It, it could be, it wouldn't surprise me if, if they put a limit.

197
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:01,840
Well, if you're hashing the password. You don't care what is given to you.

198
00:09:01,849 --> 00:09:03,989
I mean, within reason if somebody gives you a gigabyte of text,

199
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,049
it's gonna take a while,

200
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:07,309
you know, anything under 1000 characters.

201
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,859
Yeah. But I think if you cap it

202
00:09:10,219 --> 00:09:11,789
-- right, cap it at 1000
-- a

203
00:09:11,979 --> 00:09:13,700
1000 characters should be enough for anybody.

204
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:16,210
I, I, yes, famous last words. Right.

205
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,809
I, I remember there was a service I used once a long time ago

206
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,770
where

207
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:23,270
they let me enter.

208
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,729
I put in like a 32 character password, obviously from a password manager.

209
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,919
And then it chopped off like five of the characters or something.

210
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,460
And I remember I couldn't log in and for some reason, I thought, I bet,

211
00:09:33,469 --> 00:09:35,830
I bet those idiots chopped off characters and, yeah,

212
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,960
I just kept removing one character from the password and then it let me in

213
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,760
and I was like, this is insane

214
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,479
if you're gonna do this at least warn people.

215
00:09:43,489 --> 00:09:43,840
I mean, you know,

216
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:45,679
one thing I've noticed too is a lot more modern

217
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,669
websites don't make me enter my password twice just once.

218
00:09:49,409 --> 00:09:51,590
And, and personally I think that kind of makes sense because

219
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,489
they,

220
00:09:52,789 --> 00:09:56,030
you can just password reset or recovery if it's a problem.

221
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,349
Yeah. Right.

222
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,549
Right. Yeah, I, I've seen that a fair bit as well

223
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,570
and,

224
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:06,109
and so here's kind of the second part of this conversation I think is

225
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,880
people are bad at passwords and passwords. Probably need to go away.

226
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:11,070
Well,

227
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,619
actually it's worse than that because I was thinking about this and by definition,

228
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,340
a good password is,

229
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,539
has a high degree of entropy, right? We'll, we'll put a link to the XK CD comic on this

230
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,520
because I guess it's the week of XK CD.

231
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,429
And so by definition, a good password is kind of a pain in the butt.

232
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:30,539
And the second problem is by definition,

233
00:10:30,549 --> 00:10:32,609
you probably need more than one good password.

234
00:10:32,619 --> 00:10:34,890
Like for myself. My sort of critical passwords are

235
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,080
my Google,

236
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:36,960
um,

237
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,020
you know, administrative account for my domain

238
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,219
and then my icloud,

239
00:10:41,969 --> 00:10:42,830
uh,

240
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,270
and then my last pass and those are the three absolute,

241
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,909
like super duper hyper critical and they're like long and a pain in the butt.

242
00:10:50,739 --> 00:10:51,669
And then I have two fa I

243
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:53,859
enabled on all of those things

244
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,250
as well. And, and that basically is the second point of this is

245
00:10:57,609 --> 00:11:00,859
by definition, if you're doing passwords correctly, you can't,

246
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,750
it doesn't work for humans.

247
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,409
Like I, because I have a, like, I actually, I use last pass now,

248
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:11,239
but I still have a spreadsheet with over 1000 accounts and passwords in it that I'm,

249
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:14,580
like, steadily migrating into last pass as time goes on.

250
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,729
And, you know, a lot of them are dead, which is great, but

251
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:21,369
most people have dozens or hundreds of

252
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,630
accounts scattered all over God's green earth.

253
00:11:24,929 --> 00:11:25,340
Yeah,

254
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,950
it's, it's terrible and it drives me crazy when I go to a site

255
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,090
and they make me create an account instead of just

256
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:34,510
having like a button to use Google or something.

257
00:11:34,549 --> 00:11:34,559
I

258
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,669
know it's,

259
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,349
you know, you know, what is the worst of all though?

260
00:11:38,859 --> 00:11:41,780
Is I went somewhere the other day and they had a button to log in with Twitter

261
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,609
and I thought

262
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:43,330
that

263
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,270
your tweets.

264
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:46,909
-- Yes.
-- They want to be able to tweet as me. And it's like,

265
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:47,909
no. And see that's,

266
00:11:48,169 --> 00:11:50,159
I think that's going to be the next thing is it's kind

267
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:52,359
of like it'll be a sandbox thing where like you're like,

268
00:11:52,369 --> 00:11:54,119
sure app, you can have access to that.

269
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,440
And then on the Twitter back end,

270
00:11:55,609 --> 00:11:58,679
you'll actually have the list of accounts and what they can actually do.

271
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:02,750
This is what Twitter is like. Oh, sure. Yeah, here's a tweet. Go look at that Lam

272
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:04,359
Ipsum, blah, blah, blah.

273
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:05,409
Y

274
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,400
-- you know,
-- and

275
00:12:06,669 --> 00:12:08,859
I, I, I've seen this with Facebook as well.

276
00:12:08,869 --> 00:12:10,799
I remember there was, there was an app I installed.

277
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:14,400
I want to post on my wall, my phone, right? I remember the app said

278
00:12:14,729 --> 00:12:18,719
we promise not to do this and I thought just, no, you don't, right.

279
00:12:18,729 --> 00:12:21,669
-- If you don't need it but don't ask for it.
-- Yeah.

280
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:25,280
Well, exactly. We promise not to do something that we explicitly

281
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:29,750
setting ourselves up to be able to do, but we promise we'll never abuse that.

282
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,440
That's insane.

283
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,000
Exactly.

284
00:12:31,979 --> 00:12:37,169
And this is where I love how permissions work like on Android and I don't know if I OS

285
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:38,770
can do this but I can go into an

286
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,309
app settings and selectively deny access to certain things.

287
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,210
So for example,

288
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:47,799
-- uh Facebook wants to access my microphone. Nope. Right. Turn that off.
-- Yeah.

289
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,549
No, I OS allows you to do that as

290
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:53,979
well. Like for microphone, for camera, photo store,

291
00:12:54,229 --> 00:12:56,500
cellular data, a bunch of other things. Yeah.

292
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,140
And the list is enormous on Android and I love

293
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,700
it because basically I go in and just like,

294
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,419
you don't need access to this stuff.

295
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:04,099
Go away.

296
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:04,530
Right.

297
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,169
Yeah. And then the next step is it'll somehow check and like,

298
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,559
out if you don't do it

299
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,380
right. I've had apps that do that

300
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,580
or well, or it's like the classic, you know, news site,

301
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:18,469
you either have to log in or you use your three free views this month.

302
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:19,650
And my response is,

303
00:13:19,809 --> 00:13:21,309
-- you know, control w bye
-- bye.

304
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:21,530
I

305
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:21,919
agree.

306
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,070
I agree completely.

307
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:23,809
But

308
00:13:24,489 --> 00:13:27,989
I mean, if the Facebook app did that, probably enough people would be like, uh,

309
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,140
-- you know, they would choose to live
-- with

310
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,630
it. I think they would.

311
00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:32,679
And, you know,

312
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,510
it's the most infuriating thing for me is when

313
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,260
you get to like a news article and you start

314
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:40,450
reading it and then about halfway down it pops up the login page and I still close it,

315
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,830
but it's like extra angry.

316
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,630
I hate that. It's

317
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:45,270
so anyway,

318
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,049
but going back to this, I mean, fundamentally,

319
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,840
I think it really boils down to two things. One, if you're only

320
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,760
authentication is passwords, then already you've done it wrong.

321
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,739
You need to support two fa in this modern world.

322
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:01,450
And the real kicker is 222 factor authentication is not that hard to do anymore.

323
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,159
There's, there's free stuff, both for the servers and the clients,

324
00:14:05,619 --> 00:14:06,429
right stuff you can.

325
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,929
And because the other thing too is everybody's

326
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,780
carrying around a small computer in their pocket,

327
00:14:09,789 --> 00:14:10,000
right?

328
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:13,159
So you don't need to require tokens and stuff, you know, you can use open.

329
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:13,830
So

330
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:17,450
here's the deal is we love to say how everyone should be using two factor A

331
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:21,830
and I have a suspicion. Many listeners to this podcast are using two factor off,

332
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:25,330
but I read a statistic the other day that with like gmail,

333
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,750
it's 10% of users which don't get me wrong.

334
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,049
That's a lot of people, but that's a terrible number.

335
00:14:30,349 --> 00:14:30,770
Oh, yeah.

336
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,690
Well, and that's the second argument Ashley is that you shouldn't,

337
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,580
ideally you should avoid doing accounts as much

338
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:39,039
as possible and let people use their existing

339
00:14:39,349 --> 00:14:41,299
accounts that they use and care about.

340
00:14:41,349 --> 00:14:43,710
Like Google, Facebook, Twitter, linkedin,

341
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:46,059
I think are sort of four of the big ones here in North America

342
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,830
for identity providers.

343
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:52,070
Um And please, for the love of everything don't ask for like

344
00:14:52,229 --> 00:14:54,820
access to my Google Drive because no,

345
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,500
that's, that's the answer.

346
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,099
That will always be the answer

347
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,289
two. I mean,

348
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,250
because like at the cloud security lines, we do this because

349
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:05,349
we don't want the responsibility of having to take care of this data.

350
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:07,710
And especially now with, with GDPR,

351
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:10,099
like now we're really happy that we made that

352
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:12,229
seriously. Right. It's not your problem.

353
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,539
Yeah, it's like go yell at Google.

354
00:15:14,669 --> 00:15:16,469
That's, you know, for account

355
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,429
information. That's our response. Like we know their email address

356
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:23,359
and if they choose to give us their first and last name, cool, they can do that.

357
00:15:23,369 --> 00:15:26,270
But we don't require it in some things and other things we do. But

358
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:30,309
fundamentally it's like account security. Yeah, it's not our problem. It's this

359
00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:31,869
huge company over here,

360
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,380
but hopefully is doing it correctly.

361
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:35,250
And I say that,

362
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,679
but then there's companies like Yahoo where

363
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,169
apparently they weren't doing it correctly.

364
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,950
I think it's safe to say they weren't based on data breach results. I mean,

365
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:45,270
-- I, I lost track. It was how many 100 million? It's a
-- lot

366
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:49,599
but they didn't get passwords. I assume I have a suspicion. They only got hashes.

367
00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:51,549
Not that that's necessarily better.

368
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,789
So there, there's,

369
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:57,469
anyway, before we go down the Yahoo rat hole because that's too easy to do.

370
00:15:57,719 --> 00:16:00,340
There's another thing that Troy

371
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:03,780
-- hashed passwords.
-- They are hash passwords. Ok. But

372
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:04,729
it probably,

373
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:07,099
and, oh, no, no. Also,

374
00:16:07,609 --> 00:16:10,340
well, it says, and passwords for about 200 million people.

375
00:16:10,349 --> 00:16:11,179
I'm going to hope that they were,

376
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,179
-- but it doesn't explicitly say they were hashed passwords in the 2016
-- hack.

377
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:20,119
Who knows? And, and it, it doesn't matter. Right, because let's face it.

378
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,020
Most of those hash passwords are so bad.

379
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,859
You can probably crack them in a couple of hours.

380
00:16:24,349 --> 00:16:26,010
So here's the other cool thing

381
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,059
that have been po

382
00:16:27,229 --> 00:16:29,429
has done is they work with cloud flare

383
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:30,450
and

384
00:16:30,619 --> 00:16:31,969
they have this thing,

385
00:16:31,979 --> 00:16:35,570
this service now where you can check your password against because let's face it.

386
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,330
Most people can't download

387
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:41,950
20 gigs of data and do anything useful with it, right?

388
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:45,059
And so you have the ability to kind of query their server.

389
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:48,219
But here's the cool thing is you don't send the password and

390
00:16:48,229 --> 00:16:51,270
you don't even send the hash to them of your password.

391
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,250
What you send five characters of the hash,

392
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,169
what they've done is they took the basically you

393
00:16:55,179 --> 00:16:57,590
take the first five characters of your hash your pa

394
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:00,030
you take the password, you ha you sha one hash it,

395
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,849
you get your sha one hash,

396
00:17:02,469 --> 00:17:05,410
then you take the first five characters and send that to the service and say,

397
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,660
give me all of the passwords that start with these five characters.

398
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,250
And apparently the average result is like my brain tells

399
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,390
me like 500 ish give or take 450 somewhere in there

400
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,560
is the average result that you're going to get back.

401
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:22,358
And then obviously locally you can check is my hash one of these.

402
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,719
And that has a nice advantage because obviously,

403
00:17:24,729 --> 00:17:26,260
if you type your password in somewhere

404
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,540
and then a service queries this

405
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,939
and someone's paying attention to what's being queried

406
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:33,390
or even Troy himself knowing what's being queried.

407
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,819
He can say, I know what password that person has.

408
00:17:36,829 --> 00:17:40,699
And that's, that's a good, that's bad. Right. And he's smart enough not to want that.

409
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:45,469
And, uh, well, actually it's just a nice little, uh, 15 or so line

410
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:47,089
script that does this

411
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:48,310
and we'll post that.

412
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:48,819
I,

413
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:52,569
it's like, yeah. No, I, that's how I was checking my password.

414
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:55,770
It's uh it's nice to know. And that's the thing too.

415
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,699
Also, if your password is not in the database

416
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,430
now,

417
00:17:58,439 --> 00:18:00,729
they only have the first five letters of the shaw one

418
00:18:00,739 --> 00:18:03,170
hash or the first five characters of the shaw one hash,

419
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:03,729
which is,

420
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,579
I'm not going to say it's

421
00:18:05,969 --> 00:18:07,739
completely useless, but it's basically

422
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:08,760
really

423
00:18:08,869 --> 00:18:09,339
doesn't.

424
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:14,489
Yeah. Which is, which is super cool. They call it K anonymity

425
00:18:14,619 --> 00:18:16,719
-- because you're only giving up a bit of
-- data,

426
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:20,069
which is the K value is the five characters apparently.

427
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:20,680
Yeah.

428
00:18:20,689 --> 00:18:24,770
Yeah, this is, this is something really cool and this is very clever, I think and,

429
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,000
and I give these guys a lot of credit because they could have definitely

430
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,489
done this the wrong way. And, and even though

431
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,170
I have a suspicion they're,

432
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,560
they're on the side of good and would not capture this data,

433
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:35,949
the,

434
00:18:36,089 --> 00:18:39,040
the opportunity doesn't even exist, which is awesome.

435
00:18:39,209 --> 00:18:43,439
So, here's a question that's probably gonna result in something? But

436
00:18:44,329 --> 00:18:45,489
should websites

437
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:46,849
use this api

438
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,459
to check if the password you're putting in has been breached?

439
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,099
You know what I was thinking about this?

440
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,060
And

441
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,819
I think the answer is no,

442
00:18:55,449 --> 00:18:57,829
I think what websites need to do

443
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:58,880
is

444
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,380
let you put it in,

445
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,849
potentially warn you and ask you to set up two factor off

446
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,989
because that's actually the right answer. Right.

447
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,790
I fear that the correct answer is also the answer where a lot of sites are not.

448
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,989
Here's the reality, right?

449
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,430
A lot of sites are built on older technologies where they just,

450
00:19:15,709 --> 00:19:19,290
they can't easily retrofit two fa onto it without some serious effort.

451
00:19:20,489 --> 00:19:21,829
Like apparently my bank,

452
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,390
most Canadian banks don't do two fa they,

453
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,829
they claim to do multi factor authentication in the form of like, oh, what's your

454
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,099
dog's name or whatever? And it's like

455
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,219
these have the exact same failure mode as my password. Thank you. Awesome.

456
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:36,160
Well, not only that, most of this information,

457
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,829
if you pay attention to someone's Twitter or Facebook profile,

458
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:40,369
you can probably figure it out.

459
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:40,939
Right.

460
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:42,520
Yeah.

461
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,849
And so I fear, I, I think you're right.

462
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:48,390
We should at a minimum, check their password and warn them

463
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,869
maybe with like a little infographic that explains

464
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,160
kind of what the heck's going on because,

465
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,839
you know, if they take their password into a site and says it's been breached,

466
00:19:55,849 --> 00:19:56,719
they're gonna, you know,

467
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:01,319
it may not have been their instance of that password that was breached. Right.

468
00:20:01,329 --> 00:20:03,739
They just picked a password that somebody already picked up.

469
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:08,540
The other part of it is if, if you're a normal person and you made that password up,

470
00:20:08,569 --> 00:20:10,709
it's, it's on this list, I almost guarantee it.

471
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:11,530
I mean,

472
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,810
that's the reality of it.

473
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:15,869
If, if, if you're using a password manager and it's completely random,

474
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,449
it might not be on the list.

475
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,250
But I think anything a human can think of is almost certainly on this list.

476
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,130
500 million. That's crazy.

477
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,180
Well, as far as passwords go, as far as pass phrases go,

478
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:30,430
I was trying some simple ones wrapped around the word password and,

479
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:32,030
and quite a few of them were not in there.

480
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:33,829
And so I think that's interesting to me is

481
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:36,130
that people aren't even using simple pass phrases.

482
00:20:36,329 --> 00:20:38,319
Like, uh, you know, this password is hard to,

483
00:20:38,329 --> 00:20:40,459
most people don't use pass phrases because I have a

484
00:20:40,469 --> 00:20:42,750
suspicion when you go to a website and it says

485
00:20:43,219 --> 00:20:45,670
your password has to be a minimum of eight characters.

486
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,989
They don't think about pass phrase. They think about, I need eight characters.

487
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,890
What am I gonna use? 12345678, done. Right. Yeah,

488
00:20:53,665 --> 00:20:58,104
still doesn't support it. Good Lord. Td still doesn't support it.

489
00:20:58,114 --> 00:21:02,525
Yeah, for some reason, banks in Canada just do not do two factor authentication.

490
00:21:02,535 --> 00:21:04,604
It drives me nuts. I have no idea why.

491
00:21:04,834 --> 00:21:07,844
-- Maybe there's some banking regulation hidden somewhere.
-- It's possible.

492
00:21:07,854 --> 00:21:08,104
It's,

493
00:21:08,114 --> 00:21:10,905
it's more likely they have systems running on

494
00:21:10,915 --> 00:21:14,035
Cobal and it will be too difficult to implement

495
00:21:14,425 --> 00:21:15,285
for sure,

496
00:21:16,114 --> 00:21:18,525
for sure. But, I mean, so do a lot of other banks.

497
00:21:19,224 --> 00:21:21,484
Uh, yeah. Yeah, some of them, it's,

498
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:25,800
I'm not going to say it's easy because authentication can be difficult to do.

499
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:27,040
And, and not only that,

500
00:21:27,489 --> 00:21:28,660
this is, uh, I was,

501
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,880
I was talking to a friend about this

502
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:32,619
the other day is authentication for most organizations.

503
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:37,099
Like, it's not, it's not their primary focus. It's not what makes them money. Right.

504
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:38,540
-- It's just a part of
-- the product. It's

505
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,869
-- a pain in the butt
-- for them. Right. And, and they probably let the intern write it.

506
00:21:41,939 --> 00:21:46,239
And so, and, and more often than not, it's most of these places that do it wrong.

507
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,000
It's not that they're malicious or necessarily stupid.

508
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:51,239
They just, they don't know what can happen.

509
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,530
And most of the time if you explain this to people in about five minutes,

510
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,890
they're like, ah, I get it and now I understand why I shouldn't do that thing.

511
00:21:57,979 --> 00:21:58,479
Right.

512
00:21:59,020 --> 00:21:59,829
So, it's,

513
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:03,599
I, I wish there was an easy answer. Right.

514
00:22:03,609 --> 00:22:07,709
-- I, it would be nice if there was,
-- well, I mean, one simple, easy answer would be,

515
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,859
uh,

516
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:14,680
well, I think kind of what Google is doing with their deprecating, well,

517
00:22:14,689 --> 00:22:18,099
not deprecating, but they're going to be warning about http being insecure.

518
00:22:18,469 --> 00:22:20,890
I'm pretty sure Chrome is smart enough to know when you're entering user name.

519
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,979
And password because actually the other day I saw the http insecure thing

520
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,089
because I went to my little, um,

521
00:22:27,349 --> 00:22:29,380
I have a little machine that does torrent for

522
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,849
like these eight gig password files and stuff.

523
00:22:32,199 --> 00:22:36,229
And it's got just basic HTTP authentication to log into the transmission client.

524
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:36,310
Right?

525
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:37,770
I haven't bothered putting a certificate on it

526
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,650
because it's internal to my whole network.

527
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:40,979
So I log in

528
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:43,530
and I get

529
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:46,770
that big insecure word in front of the URL.

530
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:49,530
So for example,

531
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,130
Chrome could choose to do this when you're

532
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,920
entering a user name and password and then not

533
00:22:54,729 --> 00:22:55,699
entering like a

534
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:59,530
six digit number or you know, whatever other thing, then it could warn you like, hey,

535
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,229
you just entered a user name and password.

536
00:23:01,349 --> 00:23:03,829
I'm not seeing any two factor authentication going on,

537
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:04,829
you know,

538
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:07,790
did something happen on your phone because it's so cool and more to the point,

539
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,069
it would be easy to whitelist the sites that

540
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:11,510
do this like you would very rapidly find out.

541
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,290
-- Right.
-- Maybe I, I don't think this is a terrible idea. I mean, I will admit there's

542
00:23:16,609 --> 00:23:18,630
a lot of sites where

543
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:22,300
it either kind of brings you to another screen or it will,

544
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:22,900
it'll,

545
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:25,359
it'll pop up a thing on my phone sometimes and ask

546
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:27,489
me questions or it might send me a text message or,

547
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,290
or whatever.

548
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:28,689
But

549
00:23:29,369 --> 00:23:31,420
in all seriousness,

550
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:31,930
I,

551
00:23:31,939 --> 00:23:34,810
I think the power in doing something like that would be the

552
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:38,729
awareness factor because a lot of people don't know about this stuff.

553
00:23:38,739 --> 00:23:40,729
I mean, like to give you an idea is

554
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:42,630
I, I was talking to someone the other day and, like,

555
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,530
they didn't even know what an ad blocker was and I thought, how do you not

556
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:47,369
know this?

557
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,229
They installed it immediately,

558
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:50,530
completely

559
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:50,989
different.

560
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:52,219
The

561
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,079
workers are easy to sell it. It's funny that way.

562
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,479
-- Right.
-- But it's like

563
00:23:57,579 --> 00:24:00,949
in our world we've been using these things forever.

564
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:05,000
But in normal people, world, they don't even know this exists.

565
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:05,800
It's,

566
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:08,560
it's crazy to think about. And like,

567
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,949
if normal people don't know what an ad blocker is,

568
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:13,900
how on earth are they gonna even understand two factor authentication?

569
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:15,150
Right?

570
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:19,750
Or, or the fact that their passwords are terrible or to use a password manager or

571
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,869
it's awareness is

572
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:23,550
it, it is an

573
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:25,459
enormous part of this problem.

574
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,780
And, and there are so many people who just don't understand

575
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:32,099
the, the whole awareness aspect of these. And so

576
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:35,420
like this is where I give, give things like, have I been pulled a ton of credit?

577
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:35,959
Because

578
00:24:36,199 --> 00:24:38,540
essentially this is an awareness program.

579
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:41,469
Oh, Lord. Can you imagine if Google changed it?

580
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:45,079
So every time you type in a password field, it checked this database and warned you

581
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,300
that could be fun.

582
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,300
That could be really fun.

583
00:24:48,609 --> 00:24:49,000
Something.

584
00:24:49,209 --> 00:24:52,199
-- I bet you. Is there a plug in that? Does that yet?
-- I bet we could write one.

585
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:52,790
It would be,

586
00:24:53,089 --> 00:24:53,239
you could

587
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:55,420
write one. I mean, it's 15 lines of ash

588
00:24:55,979 --> 00:24:58,040
and there's already stuff while you just look at the password,

589
00:24:58,609 --> 00:25:01,439
probably two megabytes of plug in framework.

590
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:04,790
Two megs seems like it would be on the low end.

591
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,140
I, I do always love when you try to spin up like a simple web app these days or,

592
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:15,619
yeah, I've got two, like, hello World and then two megabytes of crap to make it run.

593
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,069
It's great.

594
00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:19,469
But, uh, yeah.

595
00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:23,130
No, I mean, something like that, you know, that's the thing that gets me right.

596
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:26,760
Is that what you put in front of people? Which is basically nowadays the web browser,

597
00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:29,439
right. That's it. That's what's in front of people's faces.

598
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,140
There is so much potential there for good.

599
00:25:32,479 --> 00:25:33,469
Yeah, seriously.

600
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:35,650
And I have a suspicion that's part of why Google

601
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,319
is doing this http S thing is because they,

602
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:39,250
they, they can't protect

603
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:41,540
well. Right.

604
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,300
I mean, there's,

605
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:47,599
there's other reasons behind it but the fact is like they have the faces of people

606
00:25:47,969 --> 00:25:50,400
and so they can do amazing things

607
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,660
-- with that and, and thank goodness they're, they're doing good things
-- well.

608
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,079
And part of it too is like the,

609
00:25:55,489 --> 00:25:55,699
the,

610
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:58,680
the power of a million people complaining.

611
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,989
That's something that companies will actually fix it just to

612
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,260
make the complaining stop because it's expensive to handle the.

613
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:04,560
Oh,

614
00:26:04,699 --> 00:26:04,719
yeah.

615
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:05,329
Right.

616
00:26:05,609 --> 00:26:08,310
Oh, man, there's, there's so many things I've done that with. Like,

617
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,670
I, I remember there, there have been security bugs

618
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:14,599
in various products and applications that, that, like, they,

619
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:17,099
they didn't really matter or you weren't vulnerable but

620
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:18,780
you just fix it to shut people up.

621
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:22,060
It's like I'm sick of people telling me my, my thing is vulnerable to this.

622
00:26:22,069 --> 00:26:25,119
It's not because I don't use that, but I'm gonna fix it just so you go away.

623
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:26,689
Yeah.

624
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:30,050
Well, it's, and often times it's less effort to just fix it than it is to

625
00:26:30,219 --> 00:26:33,410
keep explaining it for the next five years to customers and their auditors. Why?

626
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:36,449
-- It's not a problem.
-- Exactly. Exactly. And,

627
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,329
and I guess that's,

628
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:39,290
that's maybe the trick is we need people

629
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,459
complaining about wanting two factor off and,

630
00:26:42,469 --> 00:26:47,050
and single sign on authentication to various websites and, and nobody is right.

631
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,430
In fact, there's, there's a handful of websites

632
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,579
that I use that.

633
00:26:50,589 --> 00:26:51,030
I'll,

634
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,209
I'll shoot him an email every now and then and say something like

635
00:26:53,219 --> 00:26:55,589
you should let me log in with Google or you should use two factor

636
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:56,699
author or whatever.

637
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,959
-- And if they reply, I would
-- say that to my

638
00:26:59,140 --> 00:26:59,489
bank but they're

639
00:26:59,790 --> 00:26:59,880
not,

640
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:00,859
they don't care.

641
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:03,849
But, but right, in the rare instance they reply,

642
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:07,290
it's clear they think I'm a crazy person and now they're not wrong,

643
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,390
but not for this reason.

644
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:08,989
Right.

645
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,709
Exactly.

646
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,369
But again, if, if they're only hearing from one dude,

647
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:14,150
that's

648
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,910
probably a crazy person. Right.

649
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:20,140
If you hear from half your user base now it's something you need to take seriously

650
00:27:20,369 --> 00:27:21,260
and it's,

651
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:24,150
I don't envision this changing quickly.

652
00:27:24,479 --> 00:27:28,300
I have a feeling what would drive change is if we can get someone like,

653
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,500
like web browsers to,

654
00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:31,260
like you said,

655
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:35,780
maybe query this database and start telling people your password is on a list.

656
00:27:35,819 --> 00:27:37,270
Hopefully you're using two factor off.

657
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:39,709
Yeah, I think that's about it. That's all we can really say.

658
00:27:40,069 --> 00:27:40,729
Indeed.

659
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:41,959
II, I will say though,

660
00:27:41,969 --> 00:27:45,079
I'm excited to get this list all sorted out so I can

661
00:27:45,089 --> 00:27:47,300
see what kind of fun goodies are hidden away in it.

662
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,859
Yeah, I'm just, what also makes me wonder is this is the stuff that he found,

663
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:52,530
like, publicly as it were.

664
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,689
-- I mean, I'm just wondering how much stuff is out there actually
-- way more, way,

665
00:27:55,699 --> 00:27:56,290
way more

666
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:56,939
and,

667
00:27:56,949 --> 00:28:00,260
and not just that there's obviously illegal things

668
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:02,739
where people maybe hacked something or whatever.

669
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,459
Right. And, and it's there

670
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:08,050
and it's potentially very dangerous and, you know,

671
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:11,319
there's places that aren't hashing the passwords where, where,

672
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:11,969
you know,

673
00:28:11,979 --> 00:28:14,949
essentially criminals have plain text of your user name

674
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:17,089
and password and if you're reusing that password,

675
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:17,329
like,

676
00:28:17,569 --> 00:28:18,750
yeah, you lose, man.

677
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:21,670
Well, especially if it's the top million or whatever. Right. Right.

678
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,540
Well, man, I'll never forget, like some years ago it was, uh,

679
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:27,709
I think the full disclosure mailing list before it was the old

680
00:28:27,719 --> 00:28:30,510
full disclosure because it died at one point and then came back,

681
00:28:31,069 --> 00:28:33,510
uh, the guy who owned it, sent me an email one day and was like, hey,

682
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,770
someone's trying to log in as you with this password.

683
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,880
And I looked and like it was,

684
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:39,849
I used the same password for all my mailman subscriptions for the most part,

685
00:28:39,859 --> 00:28:41,609
except full disclosure for some reason.

686
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:45,689
And I was like, oh man, I better, I gotta change all my mailman passwords now.

687
00:28:45,979 --> 00:28:46,530
And, and

688
00:28:47,219 --> 00:28:47,589
that's,

689
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:50,239
that's also when I started using a password manager because I thought

690
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,819
the only reason I was doing this because I was too lazy

691
00:28:52,969 --> 00:28:55,060
to keep track of all my mailman accounts.

692
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,010
And

693
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:59,890
yeah, it's, it's crazy, man. I mean, that, that's the sort of thing, right? If,

694
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:04,599
if you never have an experience like that, it can be difficult to justify some of the,

695
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,040
the cost because let's face it.

696
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:10,410
Things like a password manager do come with a cost. It's pretty low these days.

697
00:29:10,489 --> 00:29:11,709
It's, it's your time.

698
00:29:11,949 --> 00:29:13,380
But, but it is there.

699
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,420
Well, more of the point you have to know they exist.

700
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,959
You have to know which one is good because there's a bunch of them out there.

701
00:29:17,969 --> 00:29:19,660
They're terrible. Like straight up

702
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,079
-- here
-- now, here's a question is a,

703
00:29:21,089 --> 00:29:24,339
is a bad password manager better than no password manager.

704
00:29:24,589 --> 00:29:25,770
I'm, I'm leaning towards,

705
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,869
I'm going to be a jerk and I'm going to say it depends.

706
00:29:28,979 --> 00:29:29,579
That's fair.

707
00:29:29,589 --> 00:29:32,219
-- I'll accept that answer
-- because some of them will be

708
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:35,319
bad in a way that's subtle and difficult to exploit.

709
00:29:35,329 --> 00:29:36,660
And some of them are just bad.

710
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,790
-- They're just,
-- that's true. That's true.

711
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:43,030
That's fair. That's fair. I guess. I guess it depends. This is where

712
00:29:43,209 --> 00:29:46,550
picking on some of the, the bigger ones might be better. Just because

713
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:50,569
when, when a problem is found they will take it more seriously as they have

714
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,189
one of my number,

715
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:55,099
that's one of my number one

716
00:29:55,609 --> 00:29:59,910
constraints for choosing software and services is not how secure are they,

717
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:03,670
but how do they respond to security incidents

718
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,489
and how quick that's fair

719
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:08,900
because the reality is no matter what I pick,

720
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:12,030
they will at some point have a problem, it might not be ever publicly known.

721
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,609
Like, like the fact that, you know, like Google,

722
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:17,319
they definitely get attacked and probably some of

723
00:30:17,329 --> 00:30:19,199
those attacks get halfway in or more.

724
00:30:19,209 --> 00:30:19,839
Oh, man,

725
00:30:20,219 --> 00:30:20,729
I mean,

726
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,479
Google can't be un hackable. That's just,

727
00:30:23,719 --> 00:30:25,170
that's not how reality works.

728
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:26,630
So,

729
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,310
you know, but from what I've seen of Google, they have like a massive,

730
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,229
uh,

731
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:36,229
internal security effort process people, everything,

732
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:38,750
you know, the, the fact that they pay for,

733
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,790
you know, project zero doing things like, like Tavis is, you know,

734
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,270
looking now at installer applications because let's face it.

735
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,030
Right. Like something like, what was it, Starcraft,

736
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,469
you know, they have an installer

737
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,319
that has like remote code execution, I think a flaw in it.

738
00:30:52,329 --> 00:30:54,109
And, you know, that's a, hundreds of millions of machines

739
00:30:54,739 --> 00:30:54,859
now.

740
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:55,260
Right.

741
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,729
And some of those, and those machines too are like gaming machines.

742
00:30:58,739 --> 00:30:59,660
Which have like some real

743
00:30:59,829 --> 00:30:59,859
do

744
00:31:00,699 --> 00:31:01,569
not like that

745
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,859
iot like where it's, you know,

746
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,729
a three watt chip we're talking about things that are consuming, like, you know,

747
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,109
that's a 200 watt CPU with like four GF

748
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:09,400
or

749
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,680
-- some serious Cryptocurrency mining with that.
-- Right.

750
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,739
Well, 100 million of those.

751
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,920
Indeed. Indeed. All right, man, I think we should probably call it.

752
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:22,430
This is, I guess for what it's worth folks. Uh, check out, have I been pwned.com?

753
00:31:22,439 --> 00:31:25,489
We'll put a link in the show notes and, and see if you've been ped and,

754
00:31:25,869 --> 00:31:29,189
and even if your password doesn't show up there, you should, uh, be afraid.

755
00:31:29,469 --> 00:31:33,150
Right. That's just living constant fear. That's, that's the easiest way.

756
00:31:33,739 --> 00:31:37,089
All right, cool. Thanks. Kurt. Thanks everybody. Yeah. Hit up open
