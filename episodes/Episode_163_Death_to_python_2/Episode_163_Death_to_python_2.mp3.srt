Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 163 with myself,

1
00:00:09,949 --> 00:00:10,600
Kurt Siefried

2
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,670
and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,459
So this is another one of those episodes where Kurt has a secret topic

4
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:19,579
and he won't tell me what it is and it's driving me insane.

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,340
So, all right, man, out with it,

6
00:00:21,799 --> 00:00:25,989
it's not a secret. It's something you have known or should have known about.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,870
Just stop it. What are we talking about?

8
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,110
The death of Python two in

9
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:35,310
three months? 21 days, 12 hours, nine minutes and 50 seconds. As of this recording,

10
00:00:35,639 --> 00:00:39,389
you have one of those, like retirement calendars up on the wall or something.

11
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,799
Python clock.org.

12
00:00:42,099 --> 00:00:43,599
I will not miss Python two.

13
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:49,360
I will admit, I, I moved all of my stuff over to Python three some time ago

14
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,880
and I have no regrets.

15
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,650
Was it only 10? I feel like it might have been more,

16
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:56,529
pretty much

17
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,189
well, and there's some arguments that,

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,200
like Python 3.1 wasn't really ready for prime time, which to some degree.

19
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:05,379
Yeah. I mean, there were, there were problems but, um,

20
00:01:05,559 --> 00:01:09,050
I mean, realistically since about five years ago,

21
00:01:09,309 --> 00:01:12,040
at least Python three has been pretty rock solid and

22
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,519
if your libraries that you depend on haven't been moved,

23
00:01:14,529 --> 00:01:15,199
well, then

24
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,489
you need to move them or find new libraries

25
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:19,230
that, yeah, you probably need new libraries.

26
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:22,500
That's almost certainly an unmaintained project at this point.

27
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,470
If they haven't updated it. Well, unmaintainable.

28
00:01:25,779 --> 00:01:27,660
Well, that, that could be too actually because,

29
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:31,209
but here's the thing, the differences aren't that great if you can't put your code,

30
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,120
like, what kind of horrible code do you have?

31
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:36,620
Yeah. Well, I mean, yeah. Yeah. Yes.

32
00:01:36,809 --> 00:01:42,349
Anyway, that's, that's all there is to say to that. Why is this our topic? I Python two

33
00:01:42,589 --> 00:01:43,580
is great.

34
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:47,919
Uh, hacker news, like, lost their collective mind.

35
00:01:48,059 --> 00:01:50,690
That's what hacker news does. That's their job.

36
00:01:50,699 --> 00:01:54,599
If they didn't lose their minds or whatever the topic was being discussed,

37
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,970
I would be very concerned.

38
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,129
Something is wrong with the fabric of the universe.

39
00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:02,330
Well, but it also feeds into that sort of whole, what is wrong with security.

40
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:08,309
And here's a great example of so Python two, they literally, if you go to the website,

41
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,320
it says

42
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,240
here, let me read a word forward to make sure I get it right.

43
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,649
Sunsetting Python two,

44
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,770
we are volunteers who may take care of the Python programming language.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,259
We have decided that January 1st 2020 will be the day that we sunset Python two.

46
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,490
That means that we will not improve it anymore after that day.

47
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,199
Even if someone finds a security problem in it,

48
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,410
you should upgrade to Python three as soon as you can.

49
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,660
And then they say why they're doing this and how long? And blah, blah, blah, blah.

50
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:31,479
And that's all fair.

51
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,889
And, I mean,

52
00:02:33,089 --> 00:02:34,970
man, how long was Python two? Around,

53
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,740
like, two decades?

54
00:02:36,899 --> 00:02:40,449
I don't even know if I remember Python one. I don't, I don't know.

55
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:43,199
Maybe I do and I just don't know. I know,

56
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,559
but I feel like it has been Python two as long as I can remember.

57
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:49,149
Yeah, it's been anyways.

58
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,289
Here we go.

59
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:51,529
But, um,

60
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:55,410
version 1 January 94.

61
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,889
Uh, that's one thing a lot of people forget is how old Python is. Right? Like

62
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,100
Python two,

63
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:02,250
I

64
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:02,649
bet Pearl

65
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:04,000
is older than Python. Oh,

66
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,179
yeah,

67
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,970
for sure. Python 2.0 was released in October of 2000?

68
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:14,759
Wow. Ok. And I started learning Python in probably, 01 or 02

69
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,039
somewhere in there.

70
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:16,410
Well,

71
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,800
the biggest thing I think, well,

72
00:03:18,809 --> 00:03:22,440
for what I'm used to is like when R PM depended on Python.

73
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,449
That's kind of what made it real,

74
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:28,490
you know, all the systems then needed Python.

75
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:30,000
Um,

76
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,600
I think it's safe to say they, they still do.

77
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,089
I mean, if you run a Linux system,

78
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,470
a nontrivial number of system utilities are Python underneath.

79
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,800
It's, it's what Pearl used to be.

80
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:43,320
Well, and this got me thinking about the whole security thing. Like,

81
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:46,059
it's good and healthy

82
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,259
to sunset old code.

83
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,429
Yes. Like 100

84
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:50,729
has been

85
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:50,919
on

86
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,619
like like Python three

87
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,889
unicode support man. Like you, you just can't do Unicode and Python two

88
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,600
like you technically can but you can't,

89
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:05,000
it's still not great but it's, it's better. I actually, so you'll love this.

90
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:07,039
I remember I wrote

91
00:04:07,339 --> 00:04:10,630
my own backup system back in the day. In fact, it's still in my github.

92
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,500
I named it S four YNC which stood for S3 sync.

93
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,309
And actually Amazon sent me a takedown notice which I ignored and

94
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,399
they never did anything about because I put S3 in the description,

95
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:21,420
but

96
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:24,769
I assumed that was good.

97
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:26,670
Anyway, anyway, so

98
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:30,369
I was backing up all of my stuff into S3.

99
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,619
It would encrypted and do a bunch of other things. And the challenge was I had

100
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:36,489
a blue Oyster cult

101
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:39,079
CD ripped to MP3

102
00:04:39,299 --> 00:04:41,200
and the O in oyster cult

103
00:04:41,429 --> 00:04:43,309
is like an o with the um

104
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,329
lot. Right. Right.

105
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,250
And

106
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:49,049
it took me longer than I want to admit to

107
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:52,769
make that work in Python two where you could actually

108
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,390
like, like read store, write and restore

109
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,369
the 01 stupid character.

110
00:04:59,619 --> 00:04:59,640
Yeah,

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,989
that sounds about right.

112
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,700
Yep. Yep. Oh, man, those

113
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:03,260
were.

114
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,040
And, and I, I,

115
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,440
I've not, I don't maintain this or use it.

116
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:10,440
So please, if, if you go digging, do not, do not use it. It is bad

117
00:05:10,609 --> 00:05:10,940
code.

118
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:11,750
If,

119
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,399
if somebody is having a problem getting rid of

120
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,220
their Python two to move to Python three.

121
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:19,790
There's no way that application is ever getting proper security updates.

122
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:22,769
Uh. Right. Definitely not by definition.

123
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:26,609
That, that is not a healthy, well, it's not a maintainable application.

124
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,380
Right. And this, I think lends itself to a topic

125
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,750
that we've discussed in the past. I know is the fact that

126
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,920
while you can look at something and say it does or doesn't have CV E I DS,

127
00:05:39,929 --> 00:05:42,369
let's say it does or doesn't have security advisories.

128
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,839
But then there's all this stuff you can look at around it,

129
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,829
all this metadata that tells us way more I think

130
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:50,350
than a project releasing security advisories.

131
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:52,109
When was the last release of this thing?

132
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:54,959
Has there been a release of this thing in six months or a year? Right?

133
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:59,320
When was the last commit? How many people are active in the issue? Tracker?

134
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,899
What are there stars? Are there forks in the case of github

135
00:06:03,049 --> 00:06:04,230
metadata we have there?

136
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:07,869
And the fact is if you have a project that only supports Python two,

137
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,190
that's like that is a huge red flag, right?

138
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,730
I mean that that's like saying we'll only run on some archaic version of so

139
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,869
os Well, no, just don't run that then. That's the answer.

140
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:20,529
Yeah, pretty much like I'm looking. Oh, wow. Oh,

141
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,859
because rail six came up. That's why.

142
00:06:22,869 --> 00:06:25,709
So here's what I love looking, a great example of this is looking at Docker hub,

143
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:28,329
the official Ruby image updated 17 minutes ago.

144
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:33,679
The official J Ruby image also 17 minutes ago. Red mind 16 minutes rails, 16 minutes.

145
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,140
Ruby gem slash act.

146
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,269
Three years.

147
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:39,820
Whoops.

148
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:40,359
You know.

149
00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:40,589
And,

150
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,209
and then there's a bunch more like four hours a

151
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,309
day but there's a bunch of these that haven't been updated

152
00:06:44,609 --> 00:06:45,630
in years

153
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,029
and they have

154
00:06:47,859 --> 00:06:48,709
100

155
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,549
100,000 plus downloads.

156
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:51,429
Yes.

157
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:54,510
And the sad reality is

158
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,309
there. They may never get updated. And

159
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,500
now some of the people just don't know better because

160
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,140
you always run into people who maybe have been using

161
00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:03,380
a

162
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,579
broker

163
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,200
plus

164
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,450
downloads updated three months ago.

165
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,630
This one, a wo service operator,

166
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,790
half a million downloads eight months ago

167
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,660
because I was looking for Aws Docker images to just

168
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,429
use the S3 uh command line sync and stuff,

169
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:19,160
right?

170
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,269
None of these things have been maintained in months and

171
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,750
the vast majority of these over a year ago,

172
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,299
does Amazon own those or is it just some random third

173
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,549
party random stuff?

174
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:34,200
I don't think Amazon makes Docker images available in Docker hub or at least

175
00:07:34,549 --> 00:07:37,230
I'm not seeing an official one. Like if you search for,

176
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:41,179
you know, a lot of apps, you'll find that official one from like

177
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,700
or or not from an official company,

178
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:47,649
but like there's an official image that's well maintained like like Ruby is a great

179
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:52,200
example that that official Ruby image is updated like at least once a day.

180
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:54,040
It seems like it's crazy up to date,

181
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:55,649
right? That's cool.

182
00:07:55,929 --> 00:07:59,700
I wonder if Amazon has their own registry. That seems like something they might do.

183
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:03,609
They have the, well, they have their own registry as a service that you can use.

184
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,619
The

185
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,140
Ecr

186
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,260
Elastic container registry. I want to say. Of course it is.

187
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:13,040
That seems exactly like how they would

188
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,630
because it's code pipeline plus CCR plus CCS

189
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,369
to get your full stack of container stuff and

190
00:08:18,859 --> 00:08:18,880
G

191
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:19,579
on.

192
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:20,799
Um,

193
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,290
so anyway, software maintainability.

194
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:23,720
Yes,

195
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,820
it is hard.

196
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,730
It is terrible

197
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,290
and it's not just hard, it's,

198
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,730
it's expensive.

199
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:30,839
You know,

200
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,308
somebody was talking to me and pointing out that in Japan, for example,

201
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,669
there's a huge problem in the Japan software industry and you know what it is

202
00:08:39,109 --> 00:08:41,340
gaming in Japan is awesome.

203
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:46,090
So all the cool programmers go to gaming companies. Why would they go work at a bank?

204
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:51,760
That seems fair. Actually, there's even more context I can add to. That is

205
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,840
the in, in Japan,

206
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:58,080
especially for the large multinationals and banks

207
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,049
which I've dealt with in

208
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:01,309
the past.

209
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:05,700
They have a very unique view on quality we'll say,

210
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,270
and they don't

211
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,390
like to use things that change ever.

212
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,969
And so this is one of the challenges actually when

213
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:15,909
they're dealing with software because software generally changes a lot.

214
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:16,440
And so

215
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,119
they like to find old versions that don't change

216
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,039
but you and I know what's wrong with that story.

217
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,799
And so it's a very unique way of looking at this, I think.

218
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,200
Yeah, well, you end up programming yourself into a corner and then when, you know,

219
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,710
the world changes and you need well, unicode support,

220
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:34,270
I would hope they have unicode support.

221
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:34,799
I mean, they're,

222
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,039
they're Japanese. I feel like they should have that

223
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:37,309
thing.

224
00:09:38,289 --> 00:09:39,010
One would hope

225
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,200
not. I don't know. But I mean, your problem about

226
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:45,690
having all of the, the good developers, the young people,

227
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,510
especially going towards writing video games.

228
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,630
I mean, I totally get that too just because

229
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:55,090
I know that the Japanese population is in decline essentially where

230
00:09:55,099 --> 00:09:57,679
obviously there's fewer people being born than there are dying,

231
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,969
which is just kind of the nature of advanced society, I think.

232
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,169
Well, but the main thing is they have like next to no immigration.

233
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:08,530
Uh that could be, I, I honestly don't know, I don't know how that all works, but

234
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:09,770
the point is

235
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:14,630
it's a small place you can easily get around the country is my understanding. And so

236
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:18,460
you get on a train and go work in the city for a game company, right?

237
00:10:18,469 --> 00:10:21,219
Whereas I know, for example, I'll pick on the United States here.

238
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:24,340
There's lots of people who live in a place and they may not have

239
00:10:24,349 --> 00:10:28,510
opportunities so that can sometimes I guess lend itself to this sort of industry.

240
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:31,969
But yeah, totally, man, I mean, if I had a choice between a game company and a bank,

241
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,580
I'm going to work with the game company, right?

242
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,260
Well, especially when you're younger.

243
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,260
You know, there's that perception that it's cool. It's fun. It's hip

244
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,039
and it probably is.

245
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:45,799
I mean, I'm old, I'd still go work at a game company. I'm not even going to pretend

246
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,109
I

247
00:10:46,219 --> 00:10:48,840
can't complain though. I'm pretty happy with where I landed.

248
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:53,059
But, yeah, I, I get that. And, and this is, this is one of the challenges. I know.

249
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,809
I know. I know we've talked about it. I talk about it all the time is

250
00:10:56,059 --> 00:10:59,359
you look at, I'll pick on a local government, for example,

251
00:10:59,479 --> 00:10:59,840
right?

252
00:10:59,849 --> 00:11:03,309
Where they've got some web resources, they're running a website,

253
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,549
they might have some servers

254
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,320
and they need to hire a developer to

255
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,130
work on their like internal pothole application,

256
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,590
for example, which I know you'll rant about momentarily

257
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,570
and

258
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,119
like, are you going to go work for the local municipality making well below

259
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,419
the average wage of someone in your field or are you going to go work for?

260
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:26,960
I don't know, like the bank or the video game company or something in town, right?

261
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:27,479
It's,

262
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,049
it's a no brainer.

263
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:30,890
And now I will say though, however,

264
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,169
uh any of you in public service and you're doing this for the good of humanity.

265
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:37,940
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Because I recognize

266
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:41,210
you work really hard and you're underpaid and underappreciated

267
00:11:41,219 --> 00:11:42,530
and I'm not trying to make fun of you.

268
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:45,840
I'm just trying to explain reality to those who don't know.

269
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,690
Well, it's just the economic reality isn't.

270
00:11:47,989 --> 00:11:48,530
And I think the

271
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,049
domain had a good solution to this,

272
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:53,880
which is you sort of need to centralize this and have,

273
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:55,090
for example,

274
00:11:55,099 --> 00:11:57,260
the provincial government provide a pothole

275
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,299
app that all the municipalities can use

276
00:11:59,859 --> 00:12:00,159
to me. Come

277
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:01,200
on tell your story.

278
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:01,700
Pothole.

279
00:12:02,729 --> 00:12:06,859
Well, so we have a 311 phone number where you can phone and talk to the city, you know,

280
00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:09,489
to find out like when is the pool open or report a pothole?

281
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:13,900
And so, I mean, part of my concern with this is

282
00:12:14,549 --> 00:12:16,849
the app is actually relatively decent.

283
00:12:16,859 --> 00:12:19,419
You know, it'll take a photograph, you can take an address, stuff like that.

284
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:23,630
But the problem is the process behind it is so hideously slow. Like,

285
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,469
uh, there's been two weeks now a big pile of rubble,

286
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,109
concrete on the road because somebody ripped out their driveway and

287
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:30,710
dumped it on the road and then cleaned that up.

288
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:31,080
And then

289
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,960
I dropped a big pile of rocks on the road, like right in front of where the driveway is.

290
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:39,140
So it's blocking a lane of traffic basically. And it's been two weeks now and

291
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,090
the city finally got back to me after a few days to ask for more information,

292
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:46,099
including they need all my personally identifiable information.

293
00:12:46,109 --> 00:12:48,659
And I'm like, well, how are you guys gonna protect this and use this? Because

294
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,190
for example, I reported a problem to Epcor

295
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:51,940
and

296
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:52,679
then

297
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:55,960
por anytime you report a problem to Epcor, they give a survey company,

298
00:12:55,969 --> 00:12:58,039
your phone number to phone you and see how your

299
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,780
experience was with them, which I don't want,

300
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:03,690
especially when they phoned me at Friday at 9 p.m.

301
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:05,400
Yeah,

302
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:08,580
that sounds like someone looking to break into houses,

303
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,200
column people and see who's not at home. Yeah. So you know,

304
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:14,280
so

305
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,960
yeah, I mean, I get it, it's complicated but this is,

306
00:13:16,969 --> 00:13:19,409
I think one of the advantages of cloud right is let's face it.

307
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:20,989
You give 100 admins,

308
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,349
a bare metal server and a copy of VMWARE and ask them to install it.

309
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:27,250
And what are you going to get? You're going to get 100 different installs of VM ware?

310
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,659
Absolutely.

311
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,460
And like 90% of them are probably going to be broken in some really bad way

312
00:13:32,869 --> 00:13:33,530
like they didn't

313
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,179
appropriately or they put the swap partition on the

314
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,039
whatever, right?

315
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:38,260
There's,

316
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,140
I'm sure there's a million things that can go wrong and degrade performance

317
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,650
versus, you know, Aws or Microsoft or Google.

318
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,979
They, they seem reasonably competent at this and,

319
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:49,599
but they can also do things.

320
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:51,979
We just can't like they can run statistical models and be like, oh,

321
00:13:51,989 --> 00:13:54,260
this CPU if we take the tweak at this tiny bit,

322
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,900
we get a half a percent more performance,

323
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,580
you know, you and I can't do that.

324
00:13:58,119 --> 00:13:59,260
Uh We cannot,

325
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:00,099
you know,

326
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:04,059
so I, as much as I hate this centralization and this sort of

327
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,479
mass gloaming of, you know, control and whatnot. Especially in the software world.

328
00:14:09,489 --> 00:14:13,650
Like, I would much rather have one or two good libraries than,

329
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:19,330
well, SSL is a great example. I mean, as much as we dig in on open SSL,

330
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,640
can you imagine a world with 100 poorly maintained versions of open SSL?

331
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:28,210
Uh, the, the world has that and it's terrible and that's why nobody uses most of them.

332
00:14:28,229 --> 00:14:33,059
And I would like to point out your old man inness of calling it SSL instead of TLS.

333
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:33,739
True.

334
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:34,890
Very true.

335
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,559
So SSL is dead.

336
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,840
Well, it should be dead by now.

337
00:14:41,419 --> 00:14:44,599
It's mostly dead now, I think, I think.

338
00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:47,809
But actually, actually,

339
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:52,239
so let's pick on TLS for a few minutes because you brought it up and the topic of

340
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:54,200
sunsetting software

341
00:14:54,609 --> 00:14:57,479
and this is a protocol, it's not software, right?

342
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,659
And so there was SSL was what we called

343
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:03,809
it secure socket layer like a million years ago.

344
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,739
And I think Netscape created it.

345
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,179
Maybe Netscape originally created it to ship uh

346
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,159
credit card numbers around the internet safely.

347
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,780
Sure.

348
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:12,940
And then that's why it got renamed to TL si

349
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,340
believe is because I think Netscape owned like the,

350
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:17,859
the trademark on SSL and they wouldn't share.

351
00:15:17,869 --> 00:15:20,919
So they're like, well, screw you guys. I'm going home and then

352
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:23,700
we just called it TLS. So who cares? And

353
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:28,119
TLS 1.0 I think is still supported by the major browsers

354
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:32,099
and they've basically slowly sunset these older versions and we've reached

355
00:15:32,109 --> 00:15:35,210
a point again where it's time to kill off an old

356
00:15:35,219 --> 00:15:37,719
version and it's insecure and you really shouldn't use it.

357
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,460
And the reality is

358
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,000
when this happened

359
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:42,859
for SSL two

360
00:15:43,469 --> 00:15:43,840
was

361
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,690
painful and took a long time and I feel like TLS,

362
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:51,099
1.0 is going to die very soon and no one's going to know or care.

363
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,340
Well, I mean, the Canadian government has guidance released last year that,

364
00:15:54,349 --> 00:15:57,059
you know, implements TL OS 1.2 or subsequent versions.

365
00:15:57,229 --> 00:15:58,059
Right. Right.

366
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,909
So even the Canadian government is saying, you know,

367
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:03,669
if you're running a Canadian government website, you should be TLS 1.2 or later.

368
00:16:03,979 --> 00:16:06,119
Yeah. Don't run 11. It's not much better.

369
00:16:06,369 --> 00:16:06,760
No,

370
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,080
I mean, in a perfect world we'd all be 13.

371
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,739
But in fairness there are still a bunch of

372
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,359
browsers and devices that don't quite do 13.

373
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,039
because again, it's like the whole Python two thing.

374
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:19,140
These people have stuff that's not maintained or supported in getting updates.

375
00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:22,760
And so they're, they're probably up the creek other ways and, and this,

376
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,789
this is just what gets me is there's, there's no,

377
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,250
it's not like there's a good technological solution to this because

378
00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:32,679
even a good technological solution that makes it like, almost infinitely cheap.

379
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,109
Even if it costs a penny,

380
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,409
people still aren't going to do it.

381
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:38,090
You know, it's like the, let's encrypt guy pointed out, you know, let's encrypt,

382
00:16:38,099 --> 00:16:41,169
couldn't even cost a penny a decade because bam,

383
00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:43,780
that's a huge roadblock for 90% of people right there.

384
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:47,650
You know, I got to get a po, I got to get a credit card number. It's free

385
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,130
and people still don't use it. Exactly.

386
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:52,859
Although it is apparently something like 30% of the, uh,

387
00:16:52,869 --> 00:16:54,239
TLS certificates in the world.

388
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:54,489
Now.

389
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:58,679
The public, it's quite a bit. II, I think it's substantial now. Yeah.

390
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,450
Well, it's just so much easier than,

391
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,849
I mean, every,

392
00:17:01,859 --> 00:17:06,550
I love how every other certificate sales place I've ever seen still has like

393
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,550
the command line examples of how to create this thing or a web widget,

394
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,598
which will create it for you.

395
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:14,339
Right. Let's encrypt has a script.

396
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,608
It's beautiful better than a script.

397
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:20,848
They have a thing that's included now in many links distributions.

398
00:17:20,989 --> 00:17:21,670
Is it I,

399
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,900
yeah, you have to get cert bought or whatever it's called.

400
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:29,369
Is it on there? I think you're right. I feel like I just got a certificate a little.

401
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,180
Oh, I did,

402
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,170
I did,

403
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,609
I did because of my.

404
00:17:34,739 --> 00:17:39,569
So, so I have a funny story. I'll tell. Actually when I did this, I bought a domain

405
00:17:39,949 --> 00:17:40,890
because

406
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:45,130
I brought a little Raspberry Pi with me to Las Vegas

407
00:17:45,739 --> 00:17:48,359
with I, I called it Hacker B BS.

408
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:53,119
And the idea was you connect to an open access point called hacker B BS and then you

409
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:57,479
can like tell net or SSH or even use a web browser into an old school B BS

410
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,609
and

411
00:17:58,709 --> 00:17:58,719
I,

412
00:17:58,729 --> 00:18:01,459
I got a real certificate that way because the web

413
00:18:01,469 --> 00:18:04,280
browsers were freaking out when it was trying to load a

414
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,250
self signed cert

415
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,050
if I just registered a domain,

416
00:18:07,189 --> 00:18:11,150
I got my certificate. In fact, I did, I just did an app, get install of Cert

417
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:11,310
bot

418
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,619
and then use that

419
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:18,619
to do it all. Now, the, the one sad thing in my story is the Raspberry Pi Zero. I used

420
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,180
only does a 2.4 gigahertz Wi Fi

421
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:24,300
and there is so much freaking wi fi in Vegas right now.

422
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:28,459
Like I couldn't even connect to it. 2.4 gigahertz doesn't work

423
00:18:28,739 --> 00:18:31,099
anywhere. That's not like rural.

424
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:35,569
Like I, I remember doing a war drive in Edmonton about 15 years ago.

425
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:38,609
So I had like a netbook with like four

426
00:18:38,739 --> 00:18:42,290
USB wi Fi things attached to it and I put one on each window and had them, you know,

427
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,250
hopping around and I drove downtown and like in front of one apartment building,

428
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,859
bam, like 300 S si DS

429
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:49,489
because like one per apartment,

430
00:18:49,969 --> 00:18:50,270
you know,

431
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:56,930
and so I, I can't even imagine, you know, prior to the five gigahertz stuff existing,

432
00:18:56,939 --> 00:18:58,939
how terrible these people's internet was.

433
00:18:59,229 --> 00:19:02,660
I remember having this problem. Actually, I was,

434
00:19:02,979 --> 00:19:03,939
was it here?

435
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:04,520
I don't

436
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:04,670
know.

437
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:05,770
And

438
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,660
it was basically, I mean,

439
00:19:08,949 --> 00:19:10,140
and I remember,

440
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:12,500
I purposely I moved,

441
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:16,619
I think it was a house I live in now because I have Lat and plaster walls and there was,

442
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,510
there's, there's

443
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,689
a couple of multifamily

444
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,410
housing units around me

445
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:28,150
and I could see like 20 plus access points on 2.4 gigahertz and it was like unusable.

446
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,380
I mean,

447
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:31,010
it was unusually bad and I remember I went and

448
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,760
bought a bunch of five gigahertz gear and it's like,

449
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,119
I couldn't believe the difference.

450
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,300
It was night and day.

451
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,319
Oh, yeah. Well, early on especially. But even now, like, it's still, uh

452
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,650
I can see and this is a machine that is

453
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:45,040
almost below grade,

454
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:47,839
but I can see three of my neighbors Wi Fi.

455
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:52,410
Right? Like, you know, and I live in a traditional kind of suburb style environment.

456
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,140
So, you know, even uh

457
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,420
that's, you know, I can basically see all the Wi Fi networks within 100.

458
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:00,160
Think about all the Wi Fi people have. Now you've got

459
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:04,010
an access point. Like, for example, I, I'll just, I'll talk about me.

460
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,130
Well, by default,

461
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,839
that's what the I SPS give you because they

462
00:20:06,849 --> 00:20:08,439
don't want to wire your house that costs money.

463
00:20:08,449 --> 00:20:10,040
Well, right. Well, not only that,

464
00:20:10,739 --> 00:20:13,589
I have a Google Wi Fi access point.

465
00:20:13,699 --> 00:20:18,160
My ISP insists on enabling their access point, which I cannot turn off,

466
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,619
but I can circumvent at least.

467
00:20:19,689 --> 00:20:21,959
Is that because you're part of their public Wi Fi thing.

468
00:20:22,209 --> 00:20:22,829
I don't know.

469
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:25,920
It's probably something stupid like that because remember that's, that's

470
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,770
because I know locally that's what I think Shaw was

471
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,760
doing to build out their wi fi support was,

472
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:35,119
you know, your, your shaw router had the Wi Fi for you and then the Shaw public Wi Fi

473
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:38,640
it, it wouldn't shock me if it does something like that. And,

474
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,420
but then I've got a printer

475
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,219
which

476
00:20:41,479 --> 00:20:46,449
right now I turned off the Wi Fi but when, like, if you just buy a printer and turn it on,

477
00:20:46,459 --> 00:20:49,530
it's screaming, hey, look at me, I'm an open access point, right?

478
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,910
You have people with phones that will have their access points turned on,

479
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,660
which I think like, what kind of monster does that?

480
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,459
Your battery life has to be 25 minutes.

481
00:20:56,469 --> 00:21:00,969
But whenever I see it all the time, I love that when I'm on a plane and I like, you know,

482
00:21:00,979 --> 00:21:03,099
I'm trying to connect to the plane Wi Fi and there's

483
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,660
other Wi Fi available. I'm like, what?

484
00:21:06,239 --> 00:21:09,640
So actually I am one of those people, I have a,

485
00:21:09,979 --> 00:21:14,589
a travel access point like a travel router. I carry with me at all times.

486
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,670
And what I do then is I turn it on.

487
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,900
I connect it to the plane Wi Fi and then I can connect like 30 devices through it

488
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:23,719
because it's a pain in the butt to log everything in.

489
00:21:23,729 --> 00:21:26,729
Because I got my phone, I've got a tablet, I've got like my Nintendo switch,

490
00:21:26,739 --> 00:21:27,930
I've got my computer, whatever.

491
00:21:27,939 --> 00:21:29,089
I've got a ton of garbage

492
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:29,780
and

493
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:34,020
I've, I've given up and that's my solution now. I, I bring it everywhere with me.

494
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,810
Anywhere I go, I connect it to the Wi Fi where I'm at and then all of my devices are like,

495
00:21:37,819 --> 00:21:39,540
yay internet and I'm done.

496
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,420
So it's beautiful.

497
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:41,859
Yeah, that's fair.

498
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:45,890
But coming back to this, I mean, you know, at least with 2.4 to 5 gig Hertz,

499
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,979
there's like, well,

500
00:21:47,109 --> 00:21:49,800
it boils down to 2.4 gigahertz stopped working.

501
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,619
Uh, yeah, I think, yeah, like it, it wasn't that you wanted to upgrade it,

502
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,449
but it just stopped working.

503
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:58,979
So you had to upgrade and you know, the same thing. Um Well, not so much.

504
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,719
Same thing with what is it like Wi Fi six

505
00:22:00,729 --> 00:22:02,849
or whatever the new standard thing is being called uh

506
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:03,040
Wi

507
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,099
Fi six? Yes, they're finally giving it a name. People can understand

508
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:09,229
why are we now in like 802 11 AC

509
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,979
W or something? I don't forget.

510
00:22:11,729 --> 00:22:17,209
I have no idea. That's the thing. I have no idea what it's called. I remember B and G

511
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,589
uh it

512
00:22:20,689 --> 00:22:21,199
is A

513
00:22:21,329 --> 00:22:21,709
X.

514
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,199
It is A 02 11 A

515
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,130
X.

516
00:22:24,329 --> 00:22:25,359
What does that mean?

517
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:26,239
Like?

518
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:32,920
Well, that's kind of weird because not from A to Z. I don't know who cares. Uh

519
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,000
Oh, wow. Their website auto plays music and a video.

520
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:37,180
That's beautiful.

521
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:39,800
Well done. Slow clap for you.

522
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,640
Oh, wow. They claim up to 9.6 gigabits per second

523
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,729
and four times more capacity for devices.

524
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:46,359
So this is definitely going to happen in, like,

525
00:22:46,369 --> 00:22:49,530
commercial spaces where you have to deploy that because

526
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:51,930
I would buy it today if I could.

527
00:22:51,939 --> 00:22:55,849
I don't think they have any, like, non ridiculously priced gear yet though. Not yet.

528
00:22:55,939 --> 00:22:59,420
But I mean, the, the looking at it, it's definitely better than five gigahertz,

529
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:02,209
but it's not so much better that I'm going to have to upgrade.

530
00:23:02,219 --> 00:23:03,729
Like I did from 2.4 to 5.

531
00:23:03,979 --> 00:23:05,670
I would be happy to upgrade.

532
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:06,229
Yeah.

533
00:23:06,239 --> 00:23:06,510
Well,

534
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,500
and I think this is the problem with software is by definition

535
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:14,260
software works until somebody either attacks it and makes it stop working or

536
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:17,160
it gets sort of so out of date that, you know, for example,

537
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:20,319
it only talks SSL and everybody else stops talking SSL.

538
00:23:20,329 --> 00:23:21,359
Uh So let me,

539
00:23:21,369 --> 00:23:27,869
let me ask you a sideways question related to that is if you look on showdown,

540
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:32,489
you will find people running stuff that is comically out of date.

541
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,329
And in fact, a lot of it has been hacked three ways from Sunday

542
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:39,540
and it's an instance where people will break in

543
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,609
and kick out the last person who broke in

544
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,329
and you know what I mean?

545
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:44,479
So

546
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:48,900
there is an aspect of that, but I think there's still many,

547
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,599
many people who either don't know and they don't

548
00:23:51,609 --> 00:23:54,640
understand what's happening or they just legitimately don't care.

549
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:58,329
And is there anything that can be done about that problem?

550
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:01,560
No, because for example, I have a bunch of iot at home. Some of it's,

551
00:24:01,829 --> 00:24:01,920
I

552
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:05,050
think, higher quality, like my smoke alarms.

553
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,699
I've had them actually replaced twice by Google because

554
00:24:07,709 --> 00:24:09,790
they were false alarming and having other problems.

555
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,849
And so they seem to get forced over the air updates. But I have no idea.

556
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:15,650
Like my Google wi Fi seems to

557
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:19,680
it, auto updates itself and it seems to be getting updates and it seems to work well.

558
00:24:19,689 --> 00:24:19,939
But,

559
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:24,319
you know, I have like a Skylink Net system that definitely doesn't auto update.

560
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:24,780
And I'm,

561
00:24:24,949 --> 00:24:26,479
you know, I port scanned the thing and it

562
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:30,650
stopped. So I had to like hardware, you know, recycle it to get it back up and running.

563
00:24:30,979 --> 00:24:31,800
So don't do that.

564
00:24:32,369 --> 00:24:34,560
So clearly it's not high quality software.

565
00:24:34,569 --> 00:24:37,300
And I mean, it, you know, this little puck that

566
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,300
talks, what is it?

567
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,520
700 megahertz, all the devices, you know, cost like 40 bucks or whatever.

568
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,339
So I, I'm not expecting high quality software.

569
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:45,020
So I'm going into this, you know, with my eyes open,

570
00:24:45,479 --> 00:24:46,000
but

571
00:24:46,449 --> 00:24:50,160
all of this stuff is, you know, I've made sure it's not on the internet,

572
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,300
right, because it would get hacked in a minute on the internet.

573
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,310
Right. Because

574
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:57,739
the Skylink Net stuff is running software that when I bought it,

575
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,250
I'm assuming the software was one or two years out of date already,

576
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,500
almost certainly.

577
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,180
And

578
00:25:02,439 --> 00:25:06,180
that is, this is one of the problems that I don't know

579
00:25:06,569 --> 00:25:09,689
if we're ever going to see a solution to because I think

580
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:10,900
it is,

581
00:25:11,099 --> 00:25:14,819
it is really easy. The economics. Yeah. Right. Exactly.

582
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,219
You can't support a $5 device.

583
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:18,329
Yes,

584
00:25:18,479 --> 00:25:20,189
I agree with that 100%.

585
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:22,359
Unless there's like some really bizarre

586
00:25:22,369 --> 00:25:24,750
economic marketing branding thing behind it

587
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,750
to make them want to support it. Like IKEA is a good example.

588
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,630
IKEA does a lot of recalls, like all those dresses that tip over.

589
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,290
If you don't attach them to the wall,

590
00:25:32,569 --> 00:25:35,030
you can, like, still walk in with them and they'll give you, what is it,

591
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,729
store credit or a refund or whatever?

592
00:25:36,939 --> 00:25:39,750
Uh, yeah, but that's because they can get sued if people get hurt.

593
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:44,170
No one gets hurt with your crap iot device.

594
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:47,560
Well, but there are brands that want to protect their brand and will, you know,

595
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:53,089
kind of keep supporting stuff. But there doesn't seem to be any strong economic

596
00:25:53,199 --> 00:25:58,959
reason for 99.9% of the stuff to get updates for more than some

597
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:02,420
minimum amount of time months or maybe a year.

598
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:03,030
I

599
00:26:03,459 --> 00:26:04,650
have smart light bulbs.

600
00:26:04,989 --> 00:26:08,099
They're led light bulbs. So they should last a good long while.

601
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:09,209
Probably 10 or 20 years.

602
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:13,300
Are they ever going to see a software update? Probably not,

603
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:14,439
probably not.

604
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:17,770
The good thing is they're not IP, they're, they're on that 700 megahertz.

605
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:22,119
What is it Zigbee or something? Or XZ is one of them there, there's like three or four.

606
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:22,729
I think the Z

607
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:24,300
is one Zigbee is one

608
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,479
Z wave. I think that's the one, I don't know if X 10 counts anymore.

609
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:28,910
I think

610
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:29,130
X,

611
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:33,930
I think actually you can buy, I guess X 10 gear, like, by the pound off Ebay.

612
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:35,410
Yeah.

613
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:39,630
The stuff is, like, basically free because there was so much of it there for a while.

614
00:26:40,739 --> 00:26:41,369
But, um,

615
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,069
you know, I expect an led light bulb to last at least 10 or 20 years.

616
00:26:45,449 --> 00:26:48,869
So let me, let's reframe this. We're, we're nearly out of time.

617
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,449
So let's bring it all back around.

618
00:26:50,489 --> 00:26:53,790
So we're saying there's no economic model to support

619
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,310
IOT gear

620
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:58,189
from a security or just any update perspective.

621
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,410
What about, what about Python? Why are people supporting Python? Right.

622
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:06,010
That it basically has a, a as close to zero,

623
00:27:06,199 --> 00:27:08,430
you know, sales model as you can get

624
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,219
yet. We're upgrading it and we're s sending the old one.

625
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:14,569
I mean, Python is one of those things where here's the thing. If I

626
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:15,640
have,

627
00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:17,260
if I find a bug in Python,

628
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:18,670
I can report it

629
00:27:18,869 --> 00:27:21,380
and I can potentially fix it or find somebody else to fix it.

630
00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:25,739
If I find a bug in my IOT gear, please explain to me what I do with that bug.

631
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:29,800
Assuming it's not like IKEA or Google or some big company.

632
00:27:30,719 --> 00:27:31,400
Yeah. Nothing.

633
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:33,750
So you hit on an important point and I was kind of,

634
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,060
I'm kind of glad you made it here because it was what I was thinking of as well is

635
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:41,359
you look at something like Python and Python has a vibrant community around it.

636
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:43,439
It has people who are actively maintaining it.

637
00:27:43,719 --> 00:27:45,939
Many of them do this as their jobs because there's

638
00:27:45,949 --> 00:27:49,650
a financial incentive for an organization to hire an employee,

639
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,219
a Python core developer.

640
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:55,079
And so it, it's, it's open source at its finest now.

641
00:27:55,089 --> 00:27:58,060
There are all open source libraries, like for example, look at my

642
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:58,520
github.

643
00:27:58,530 --> 00:27:59,040
It is,

644
00:27:59,069 --> 00:28:02,829
it is basically a cesspool of half finished garbage project

645
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:05,119
that haven't been updated in years in many cases.

646
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:09,910
And is that open source? Yes. But it's basically your IOT light bulb situation.

647
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:14,060
Now, on the plus side, I hope nobody's using my stuff because why would they?

648
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,180
And

649
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:19,489
it is never going to be updated because I don't care and I'm lazy and whatever.

650
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,459
Although someone, I guess if someone sent me a pull request, I might think about it.

651
00:28:22,469 --> 00:28:22,739
But

652
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,060
the point is,

653
00:28:24,449 --> 00:28:25,209
well, that's, ah,

654
00:28:25,219 --> 00:28:27,650
but you just hit on something if somebody wanted to hijack it

655
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,569
and keep it up to date and fix it and improve it,

656
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:32,250
they, they could, they wouldn't even have to ask you for permission.

657
00:28:32,489 --> 00:28:35,020
Exactly. Exactly. And this is

658
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:37,119
one of the interesting things I think we're,

659
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,359
we're seeing with all this technology and the way it works,

660
00:28:39,369 --> 00:28:40,890
it's full of open source is

661
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:46,520
there are large companies that don't need vibrant communities because they've

662
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:50,500
hired vibrant communities and they have developers working on this stuff

663
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,760
and you look at something like an IOT vendor that is small and doesn't care and isn't

664
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,729
taking care of their stuff that is like

665
00:28:56,739 --> 00:28:59,099
the cesspool of open source where there's kind of

666
00:28:59,859 --> 00:29:00,199
there,

667
00:29:00,209 --> 00:29:02,319
there's nothing anyone can do about this

668
00:29:02,329 --> 00:29:04,719
because you probably can't touch this stuff.

669
00:29:04,729 --> 00:29:06,770
Half of these things as I understand it now are running

670
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,160
like a really stripped down Linux with PHP on top.

671
00:29:09,339 --> 00:29:12,099
It, it would not shock me, it would not shock me at all.

672
00:29:12,109 --> 00:29:18,109
I mean, if, if you had to build software for an IO light bulb or something for like,

673
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,150
say

674
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,619
$1000 in total.

675
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:22,660
Right. What, what tool train are you gonna pick?

676
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,180
Oh, all open source stuff. Right.

677
00:29:25,689 --> 00:29:26,030
But I mean,

678
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,979
something you're gonna pick something ridiculously simple and probably older and

679
00:29:29,989 --> 00:29:33,130
stable and easy to make work like PHP or something.

680
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,040
Not, you know,

681
00:29:34,349 --> 00:29:36,060
no Js or Rails or

682
00:29:36,589 --> 00:29:37,810
whatever. Uh I

683
00:29:37,979 --> 00:29:41,650
would trust no Js more than PHP at this point, I think. But

684
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:42,030
it's not,

685
00:29:42,619 --> 00:29:45,199
it's about doing it cheaply and quickly. Right.

686
00:29:45,349 --> 00:29:48,410
Maybe, maybe, maybe, I don't know. I got to think about this one.

687
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:49,369
I mean, think about it.

688
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:53,520
The software budget for probably some of these IOT makers is clearly sub

689
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:57,130
00.

690
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,750
And I mean, but on the flip side, you know what?

691
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,589
My light bulbs all work except for that one time

692
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,010
they stopped working and I had to reset them all,

693
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,750
which is I love the reset process.

694
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,660
You turn them on and off quickly 10 times.

695
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,869
And I mean, it has to be like click, click, click, click, click, click,

696
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,349
like really fast 10 times.

697
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,829
And then that basically does like a hardware reset of it

698
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:15,469
and it loses its settings and then you get to read

699
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:15,890
it.

700
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,180
But of the

701
00:30:17,459 --> 00:30:20,189
eight or 10 light bulbs, I have one of them, for example,

702
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:24,520
didn't want to get, didn't want to update its firmware. And luckily it, it just

703
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:27,599
the failure mode was, it didn't update its firmware. It didn't break itself.

704
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:27,910
So that was

705
00:30:28,109 --> 00:30:28,140
nice.

706
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:29,430
And then I finally,

707
00:30:29,439 --> 00:30:31,050
after some hardware recess and some other stuff

708
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,630
got the firmware on that thing updated.

709
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,540
And then I had one light bulb that just wouldn't let me add it to the cluster

710
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,920
until again, I did a bunch of hardware resets on it.

711
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:41,920
And apparently after three or four hardware resets that just

712
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:45,750
unstuck whatever was stuck. So you turned it off and on again.

713
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,449
And it started like I'm standing there,

714
00:30:47,459 --> 00:30:50,500
I plugged it in to a light switch control thing.

715
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,780
So I can like tap, tap, tap, tap, tap

716
00:30:51,989 --> 00:30:53,770
because I found you can screw and unscrew them.

717
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,540
And if you do it like really quickly, you can do it.

718
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:59,849
But you really need like to sit at a, at a light switch and go click, click, click,

719
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:01,660
click, click, click really fast.

720
00:31:02,479 --> 00:31:03,050
It's,

721
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,150
yeah.

722
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,020
Anyway,

723
00:31:06,579 --> 00:31:10,869
this is my life now. Right. Like, I got a hardware reset all my light bulbs because,

724
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:11,800
you know,

725
00:31:11,979 --> 00:31:13,010
they stopped working.

726
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,040
It. It's true.

727
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:14,560
So,

728
00:31:14,569 --> 00:31:16,680
I guess I will close with one other thing is

729
00:31:16,689 --> 00:31:20,199
it's easy to talk about open source communities and software.

730
00:31:20,449 --> 00:31:24,109
But I think when we start talking about hardware, it is a very different problem.

731
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:27,959
And I don't think we have a solution today. We may never have a solution. I don't know.

732
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,979
I think it's starting to have like thing,

733
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:32,270
things like that. It's

734
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,270
starting.

735
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:34,150
I do love thing.

736
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:36,760
I think the biggest problem is

737
00:31:37,109 --> 00:31:42,390
the level of skill needed to get into the software world is very low and the level

738
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,900
of skill to get into the hardware world and

739
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,910
make something sort of work is much higher.

740
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,189
It is true. You are not wrong

741
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:50,069
and you need a

742
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:55,510
much larger investment because the gear to make hardware work is expensive.

743
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:58,219
Well, and the iterative nature of software you build, you,

744
00:31:58,229 --> 00:32:00,020
you write a piece of software, it doesn't work.

745
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,219
You, you change a character,

746
00:32:01,339 --> 00:32:01,939
right?

747
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:04,579
And it generally doesn't light on fire

748
00:32:04,699 --> 00:32:06,540
and burn down your house and things like that.

749
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:09,300
So, or sooner than half or, you know,

750
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:14,780
the magic blue smoke because like even soldering a few joints takes forever.

751
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:18,540
And if you do it wrong, but if you do it wrong, you're, you're, you know,

752
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,800
good luck troubleshooting that

753
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:20,790
uh

754
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:23,589
you know, unless you know what you're doing with a multi meter also.

755
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:25,069
Well, No, you don't use a multi meter man.

756
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:27,199
You need that telescope if you're doing anything exciting.

757
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:27,890
But

758
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:29,780
I like doing those little kits. Right.

759
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,599
And I, I, one of them,

760
00:32:30,609 --> 00:32:33,550
I actually sort of partially cooked the motor while I was soldering it on,

761
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,390
like it got too hot and it's, you know, the one motor is kind of grumpy.

762
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:36,709
Now,

763
00:32:37,109 --> 00:32:39,790
uh that, that does happen. You got to be careful with those motors, man.

764
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,930
Well, you got to be careful with everything.

765
00:32:40,939 --> 00:32:44,349
If you, if you overheat almost any component, you can create problems.

766
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:49,810
But I think we need to call this one. So I guess in summary, we don't know.

767
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:53,670
But at the same time if you're running Python two, get rid of that.

768
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,949
Yeah, you supported software if you can.

769
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,469
Uh Yeah. Right. Get rid of Python two.

770
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:01,430
I'm calling it. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.
