Hello and welcome to episode 110 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,899 --> 00:00:12,420
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:17,049
-- I
-- mean, it feels like I haven't talked to you in, in years

3
00:00:17,389 --> 00:00:19,729
and it's been what, like two weeks,

4
00:00:20,069 --> 00:00:20,530
it's

5
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:21,879
2.5, 3 weeks.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,159
Yeah,

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,360
I guess this is one of the funny things about doing a podcast is we

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,010
can just Precor some episodes and then still publish them in a regular cadence.

9
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:29,639
So

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:34,770
to the Real World, we're still talking to each other, but in real life we're not.

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,840
Yeah. Yeah. No, it's been a good summer.

12
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:41,900
It, it has, it's been, it's been busy, uh, was at Black Hat last week.

13
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:42,900
That was,

14
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,729
I don't know, man, I, you know what I feel like when,

15
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,830
when I go to the show now and I look around and this

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,619
is kind of true of Rs A this year as well is,

17
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:51,450
it's

18
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:54,849
II, I feel like it's getting boring

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,930
and, and I think that's a good thing, right?

20
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:00,689
Because there's not like crazy new products and crazy new research and,

21
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,490
and I feel like,

22
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,949
well, well, things are on fire for a variety of reasons.

23
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,589
-- It's not like the giant tire fire. I think it was a couple of years ago.
-- I,

24
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:13,589
I would disagree. I think it is still a giant tire fire. We've just become used to it.

25
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,870
It's literally that comic everybody uses with, you know, it's,

26
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,120
everything's on fire.

27
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:18,669
It's ok.

28
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:19,779
It's fine.

29
00:01:19,889 --> 00:01:20,910
You know, it's,

30
00:01:21,199 --> 00:01:25,910
people are finding new classes of attacks, people are finding, you know,

31
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,040
um, just giant.

32
00:01:28,199 --> 00:01:30,419
Well, that, that thing they did, it was,

33
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,870
I think it was at defcon where they had a bunch of kids hacking election systems.

34
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:36,669
You know, they recreated a bunch of election website systems and,

35
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,319
you know, they had, I think it was,

36
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,910
they were posting the numbers and it was like, they had like,

37
00:01:40,919 --> 00:01:43,949
36 kids hacking into these and like, only three of them failed.

38
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:45,260
I

39
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:46,779
doesn't surprise

40
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:47,379
me.

41
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:48,889
Well, I mean,

42
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:53,760
-- I mean, we're talking like eight year olds, you know,
-- I think they were 11 and 12

43
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:54,349
but

44
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:55,260
it seems

45
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:55,500
to

46
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:57,489
indicate there was a pretty good range of ages but

47
00:01:58,139 --> 00:01:58,819
really young kids

48
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,010
and they're all terrible and we know they're terrible

49
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,660
and

50
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:06,510
I don't know, but

51
00:02:07,389 --> 00:02:10,350
I think a couple of years ago I would have been like, oh, my goodness,

52
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,279
look at how bad this is and now I, I feel more like.

53
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:13,949
Yep.

54
00:02:14,339 --> 00:02:14,850
Ok.

55
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,589
-- Well, I think
-- it's

56
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,149
bad.

57
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:20,800
I think it's bad but we've also learned that it's generally not the end of the world,

58
00:02:20,809 --> 00:02:21,539
like, no offense.

59
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,690
Even the elect, like,

60
00:02:23,389 --> 00:02:23,949
uh,

61
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:25,979
reminds

62
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,779
me that a hacked election doesn't end the world, like,

63
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:33,929
-- a year or so. Yeah,
-- exactly. But I was gonna say more like, so locally, you know, like,

64
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,440
there's, there's the crimes that make the paper basically. Right.

65
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:39,720
And some of them are, like, really kind of sad and dumb, you know,

66
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:42,720
where somebody dies because basically can't drive so good.

67
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:44,100
And, uh, oh,

68
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,520
even better example, people keep burning down their condos

69
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:50,460
because they smoke outside on the balcony

70
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,929
and then they stub out their, uh,

71
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,330
their, um,

72
00:02:54,529 --> 00:02:56,059
cigarette butt in a

73
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,470
potted plant.

74
00:02:57,869 --> 00:03:00,169
Now, here's the thing. Potted plants

75
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:01,850
used to live in dirt,

76
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,309
right? You'd go get some dirt, like, like black dirt,

77
00:03:05,429 --> 00:03:09,089
you know, or maybe some slightly fancier black dirt potting soil.

78
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,190
Yeah, it's fine. You can, you can,

79
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:12,399
it doesn't burn,

80
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,389
right? So you can stub out a cigarette in.

81
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:18,350
It turns out, turns out nowadays, potting soil, uh,

82
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,470
especially as used

83
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,970
in the plants that you buy, like in the store that are already in the dirt,

84
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:27,449
like in the pot, you know, that you hang up on your balcony or whatever,

85
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,130
that looks pretty.

86
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:29,919
Uh, it's not dirt.

87
00:03:29,929 --> 00:03:34,570
It's, it's essentially a like spongelike medium designed to hold water.

88
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,360
It's, I think mostly old sawdust

89
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:38,990
pretty much is what it's made of.

90
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:39,169
In

91
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:41,399
fact, the only reason I know that is

92
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,979
I, I met a guy once who is in charge of dealing with like the, the basically,

93
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,020
I guess old sawmills used to just pile up sawdust

94
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,660
and apparently that's an environmental hazard now for a variety of reasons

95
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,679
and they're selling it basically the companies that make potting soil.

96
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,179
Now it's what they're doing with it. And I'm thinking that's

97
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:02,839
crazy.

98
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:06,330
-- But
-- ok, if, if you don't know much about wood,

99
00:04:06,339 --> 00:04:09,539
uh wood burns better when it's dry and it has a lot of surface area.

100
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,649
So,

101
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:13,630
sawdust is essentially the

102
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,220
literal definition of what can I make that will burn the best out of wood.

103
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:23,279
Although, although a pile of sawdust doesn't burn terribly well.

104
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:23,829
No,

105
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:24,589
but when you

106
00:04:24,809 --> 00:04:24,940
burn.

107
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,519
Exactly. So,

108
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,559
but this is kind of like a sponge like material.

109
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:31,459
So, what will happen is it smolders, which means it's not

110
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:32,790
technically burning burn,

111
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,359
but it will smolder and then it'll catch light and then it'll burn down.

112
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,170
Uh, the building basically. Right. And, and we've had several major fires.

113
00:04:41,179 --> 00:04:44,799
The, the most recent one was, I think it was 84 people are now homeless because of it.

114
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,179
-- Wow, that's crazy, man.
-- Yeah, that's,

115
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:47,859
that's kind of,

116
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:50,179
but the point is as terrible as that is.

117
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:51,619
Ok.

118
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,489
Thought experiment,

119
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,019
we can spend 1% more money on all these

120
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:58,540
condos and make them not burning down from cigarettes

121
00:04:58,859 --> 00:05:01,899
being put out on the balcony proof. Is it worth it?

122
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:04,929
Does it cost more or less to just burn down a few

123
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,260
buildings or to spend 1% more on all the condos being constructed.

124
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:09,880
That's a tough question.

125
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,779
And I know you're going to frame this in the context of security.

126
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,239
And you could say if we increased all of our security budgets by 1%

127
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:17,480
what would happen?

128
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,339
And the answer is probably nothing.

129
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:20,750
-- No,
-- not a whole lot.

130
00:05:21,049 --> 00:05:24,190
-- I mean, that's the sad reality
-- of it. Well, and here's the sad reality.

131
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,679
What if we increased our security budgets by 500%?

132
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:27,250
Uh,

133
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,799
-- probably we get five times better security.
-- No,

134
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,970
I would be shocked if we got 5% better.

135
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,799
I mean, I feel like there's like this,

136
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,100
it's funny because like, you know, everybody talks about the Mythical Man Month.

137
00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:43,299
But I think there's, that's also true of budgets to some degree.

138
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,700
But yeah, it is.

139
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:50,859
And, and however, however my quality of life would probably go up substantially.

140
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:52,459
So there's that

141
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,410
it is

142
00:05:55,809 --> 00:05:58,390
anyway. Anyway. I, ok. So,

143
00:05:58,549 --> 00:06:01,540
-- so you think everything's still a giant tire fire? And, and maybe you're
-- right.

144
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:05,290
And we've also developed coping mechanisms, like, for example,

145
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:05,899
um

146
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,140
No, no, no, no, no, no.

147
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,179
What happens if your, if your cell phone gets screwed up, you just factory reset it,

148
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:13,540
log back in and boom, all your data is back.

149
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,190
Yeah, that's true. If my cell phone got hacked, I would just, probably

150
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:19,730
if somebody ransomed

151
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,799
my cell phone,

152
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:21,850
ok.

153
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:24,420
I would just factory reset it

154
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,200
and go into time machine and get the unencrypted get, go get an older,

155
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:29,859
an encrypted copy of the backups.

156
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,779
Same thing.

157
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,429
Like, if my Mac somehow got ransomware, I'd be like, oh, that really sucks.

158
00:06:34,489 --> 00:06:35,880
Thank God for Time Machine.

159
00:06:36,549 --> 00:06:38,970
Uh, yes, I would also do that.

160
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:40,130
I, I

161
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,040
do have some level of backups for almost everything.

162
00:06:43,049 --> 00:06:46,450
It, I mean, I'll admit some things are better than others, but generally speaking,

163
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:50,160
the really important stuff these days I mostly keep in, like Google docs.

164
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:50,820
Yeah.

165
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,459
You know, and part of it is uh ok. Email.

166
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:53,720
Well,

167
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,010
email is a whole lot more secure now because most

168
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:59,059
of us are using large providers with really good antivirus scanning

169
00:06:59,290 --> 00:06:59,920
and more.

170
00:06:59,929 --> 00:07:00,850
So I know for myself,

171
00:07:00,859 --> 00:07:05,329
I haven't actually used a male client really in over half a decade.

172
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:08,850
I used the web based emails which means if you're going to attack me by email,

173
00:07:08,859 --> 00:07:10,769
you first of all have to get it past Google

174
00:07:11,609 --> 00:07:15,440
and then you have to get some malicious content into a web browser.

175
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:19,299
So essentially your best bet is like fishing or social engineering,

176
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:22,040
not like a technical attack because

177
00:07:22,489 --> 00:07:24,079
chrome is pretty secure. At this point.

178
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:27,190
There was an article I read that said

179
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:33,350
something like 34,000 plain text emails got sent over the Black Hat network.

180
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,380
It was like some enormous number

181
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:42,059
and I'm just thinking, who's freaking sending mail from their MT A

182
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:47,260
Google? I don't think even supports non SSL TLS anymore,

183
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,019
do they?

184
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:49,320
No, that's true.

185
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:53,109
At the, at the carrier level, they will take non TLS SSL connections.

186
00:07:53,429 --> 00:07:57,500
But if you're a client, but if you're a client of, like, if you're Gmail client,

187
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,940
I don't think Gmail will let you talk unencrypted anymore.

188
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:03,420
Right. And most of these providers like outlook just

189
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,890
you, you have to TLS or no hablo email.

190
00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:08,260
My,

191
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:12,350
my assumption for this is people are literally connecting to port 25 somewhere

192
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:15,950
from their mail client and it's not using any sort of encryption,

193
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,519
I guess. I mean,

194
00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:20,170
not even starting T OS

195
00:08:20,929 --> 00:08:23,160
because the only thing because basically what I'm saying, what,

196
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,799
what I'm kind of wondering is, you know,

197
00:08:24,809 --> 00:08:27,720
how do the only way to set that up is to

198
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:30,920
basically set up your own email server now really badly?

199
00:08:30,929 --> 00:08:33,119
Like you kind of have to go out of your way to do this,

200
00:08:33,489 --> 00:08:34,919
you know, is what I'm saying, right? Like

201
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:36,760
it's like, it's like,

202
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:39,510
it's like putting TLS around your website now

203
00:08:40,739 --> 00:08:44,828
you with, with things like cloud flare and lets encrypt and, you know,

204
00:08:44,838 --> 00:08:47,148
I remember paying 500 bucks for an SSL

205
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:48,638
capable web server

206
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:51,388
and now every single device I have has,

207
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:52,590
you know,

208
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,320
-- some TLS capable web server in it
-- because of open

209
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:56,940
source.

210
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:57,489
Yo

211
00:08:57,739 --> 00:08:58,450
Exactly.

212
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,630
Exactly.

213
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:04,260
So at this point, if, I mean, if that's a problem for you, then you're basically,

214
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,630
you have so many problems,

215
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,849
-- but
-- here's the other part of it is you would expect most of the people at Black an

216
00:09:14,049 --> 00:09:14,770
to be

217
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:15,530
more

218
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,729
than most.

219
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,409
Right

220
00:09:18,609 --> 00:09:18,710
there.

221
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:18,849
A

222
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,179
lot of,

223
00:09:21,219 --> 00:09:24,969
well, first of all, there's a lot of less, I'm not gonna say non technical, I,

224
00:09:24,979 --> 00:09:28,099
I should have gone with less technical people there, like managers and whatnot.

225
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:29,570
And

226
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,090
there's also a lot of people who quite frankly don't care.

227
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:34,690
Maybe you

228
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:34,919
don't.

229
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:35,510
But

230
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:40,039
I would assume if you're a manager you're probably using something like gmail.

231
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:40,450
Right.

232
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,000
Well, how many people, for example, don't understand.

233
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:49,099
Well, here's a tangent, why are reproducible bills important?

234
00:09:49,109 --> 00:09:51,090
And the answer is not really because of security,

235
00:09:51,609 --> 00:09:56,109
but it is security in the sense of reproducible builds are extremely critical for

236
00:09:56,119 --> 00:09:59,700
security in the sense of you can actually push an update out quickly,

237
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:00,419
right?

238
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:01,270
That's it.

239
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:06,369
Right. Not this bit for bit thing. Who cares? But the fact like if my, you know,

240
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:10,619
who cares? Like how many vendors are there that literally

241
00:10:10,989 --> 00:10:11,979
will tell you,

242
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:12,820
you know, we,

243
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:16,219
we can't push this security update out because it takes a month or two or three.

244
00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:17,739
Right?

245
00:10:17,789 --> 00:10:19,190
I had that Twitter conversation with

246
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,969
those people talking about hardware security modules

247
00:10:20,979 --> 00:10:23,409
where they only get updates from the vendor like once a year.

248
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:24,309
And I'm like,

249
00:10:24,859 --> 00:10:25,349
oh,

250
00:10:26,609 --> 00:10:30,340
ok, then I, I don't really know what to say to that other than really that.

251
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:31,539
Well,

252
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,380
man,

253
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,640
wow. You know,

254
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,780
you have problems if your software only gets updates,

255
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:42,030
I don't care if it's security or nonsecurity update, but just updates once a year,

256
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:42,309
like,

257
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,299
yeah. Wow.

258
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,580
Anyway,

259
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:49,210
and how many people don't understand the importance of that, of being able to push a,

260
00:10:49,219 --> 00:10:51,140
a software update quickly.

261
00:10:52,309 --> 00:10:54,140
Right. A lot of people would be like, oh, what's the big deal?

262
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,419
There's, there's enough.

263
00:10:56,349 --> 00:10:56,969
It's

264
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:58,880
right. Anyway,

265
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:04,400
so anyhow, black hat was, I guess, uneventful, which is good.

266
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,039
There was, there was nothing crazy.

267
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:08,969
I did not stay for defcon and thank goodness I didn't.

268
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:09,780
Hm.

269
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:13,539
Because all the hotel shenanigans I read about were, were crazy.

270
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,080
Well, it makes sense from their perspective. Right. They had this

271
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,479
horrible incident where, what was it?

272
00:11:18,489 --> 00:11:22,489
48 people got killed and almost 500 wounded and

273
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:24,320
so. Ok. Well,

274
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,200
yeah, how do you deal with that?

275
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:26,409
Well,

276
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:31,070
I guess surprise spot checks of people's rooms to make sure they're not bringing in,

277
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,669
you know, multiple suitcases full of guns or something.

278
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:34,179
I guess

279
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:37,919
I'm not gonna get into this one because I

280
00:11:37,929 --> 00:11:40,780
think you can argue it in many different directions.

281
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,099
I think the problem is not so much what they're doing

282
00:11:43,109 --> 00:11:44,780
but how they're going about doing it and that there's no

283
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,700
consistency

284
00:11:46,349 --> 00:11:48,159
and it sounds like too, like,

285
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,859
like I know when I'm staying in hotels depending on the quality of the hotel,

286
00:11:50,869 --> 00:11:52,900
like somebody knocks on my door and I'm like, go away

287
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,780
and if you knock again I'm calling security

288
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:57,739
except it was hotel security.

289
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:58,700
-- Yeah,
-- exactly.

290
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:02,260
It's like, it's like whenever, um, well, not so much now because all the,

291
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,320
all the meters are wireless.

292
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,900
But remember back in the day when like,

293
00:12:04,909 --> 00:12:08,099
your local gas company guy would show up at your door in summer, you know, in,

294
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,890
in like, in like um

295
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:13,260
shorts and like with that big handheld monstrosity of

296
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:13,909
a

297
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:14,400
portable.

298
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,280
And they literally, yeah, they literally had to like,

299
00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:20,460
it's like I need to read your meter and it's like, ok, well, you know,

300
00:12:20,469 --> 00:12:24,219
I'll walk you down to the meter in the basement and he'd like literally glance at it,

301
00:12:24,229 --> 00:12:25,799
tap, tap, tap and then like run out

302
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,760
and I kind of always let them in because realistically like,

303
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:34,200
uh looks somewhat legit, but fundamentally, I mean,

304
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,359
I don't know what a gas meter reader guy ID looks like,

305
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,820
-- you know,
-- and

306
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:43,179
this is so right.

307
00:12:43,469 --> 00:12:45,190
Iii I don't know the answer.

308
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,460
-- I mean, there's
-- two guys in suits, you know, looking grumpy.

309
00:12:48,489 --> 00:12:49,710
Yeah, that's probably security

310
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:50,789
maybe

311
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:51,719
like,

312
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,280
I don't know,

313
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:53,780
here's the point

314
00:12:53,929 --> 00:12:54,669
is

315
00:12:54,969 --> 00:12:57,719
when you stay at a hotel,

316
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,710
you're going to have to listen to them.

317
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:01,789
And I know there have been court cases revolving

318
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:03,580
around privacy and a whole bunch of other things.

319
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,390
But I mean, fundamentally at the end of the day,

320
00:13:05,739 --> 00:13:07,000
that's what's gonna happen.

321
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:07,799
Well, you,

322
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:09,919
you can push so far and if you push too

323
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:12,250
far then you're annoying to them and they'll boot you,

324
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:12,719
you know,

325
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:16,080
and that's, I mean, that's kind of the problem with a lot of the,

326
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,190
the new online sharing economy.

327
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,159
Right. Like that guy that got booted from Airbnb and he can't find out why

328
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:22,270
is

329
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,239
something happens.

330
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,710
You annoy the company enough and the company fires you as a customer, you know?

331
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,739
And yeah, when you're at a hotel staying for a week, that kind of gets inconvenient.

332
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,210
Right.

333
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:35,849
I, yeah, II, I don't know

334
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,650
what, what to even say necessarily, but it's,

335
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:41,200
I, I'm glad I wasn't there,

336
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,559
I would say at

337
00:13:42,729 --> 00:13:42,750
a

338
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,280
minimum,

339
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:45,320
like,

340
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,030
I love this because my bank will call me.

341
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:49,359
And I'm like, how do I verify you're from my bank? And they're like, what

342
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm like, how do I verify you from my bank?

343
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,549
And they're like, uh the phone number and I'm like, no,

344
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,840
like, seriously,

345
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,599
it's like I keep getting these phone calls from stats Canada

346
00:13:58,479 --> 00:14:01,460
to the best of my knowledge, stats Canada doesn't randomly phone people,

347
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,309
-- especially from no caller
-- ID.

348
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,630
Are they looking for itunes gift cards by chance

349
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,719
or personal information? I don't know. I just hang up on them

350
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,280
because realistically, here's the thing,

351
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:16,260
realistically if the government wants to get a hold of me, they, they know where,

352
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:19,010
well, clearly they know where I live because they have my phone number too

353
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,669
and they'll send me registered email with, you know, grumpy

354
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,679
letters in it.

355
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,520
Right? Like that's, that's how revenue Canada does it? Revenue?

356
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:31,729
Canada flat out says we will not phone you, we will not email you, we will send you mail

357
00:14:32,109 --> 00:14:35,729
and if you don't reply to it, eventually we'll start garnishing your wages

358
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:37,219
and,

359
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,239
and, and I guess that's,

360
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,890
that's always the difference. Right. Is historically, I think

361
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:48,080
most of the law enforcement activities and responsibility has

362
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,229
been the job of the government and they,

363
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:52,549
I feel like now

364
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,640
we're seeing

365
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:56,229
it's right in your

366
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,049
place, like hotels starting to kind of do some of this and

367
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,270
it's,

368
00:15:01,429 --> 00:15:01,440
I,

369
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:03,390
I don't know what I think of that.

370
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,109
It's inevitable. That's the, that's the reality

371
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,429
-- is it?
-- I don't know

372
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:09,099
because the hotels don't,

373
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:12,799
the hotels I think partly have to be seen to be doing something.

374
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,270
So there, it's kind of like the TS A and airport security, right? They fail.

375
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,309
-- What is it? 90 plus percent of the security tests where people
-- trying

376
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:19,409
to

377
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,359
look in my room just have a scary looking guy by the elevator. Right?

378
00:15:24,369 --> 00:15:26,049
And that'll make most people feel better,

379
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,580
but part of it is also the liability. Right?

380
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,880
And, and here's the reality, like a room check like that.

381
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:34,799
It's probably more about your body language and kind of how you're behaving and,

382
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,320
you know, are you getting real squarely

383
00:15:37,109 --> 00:15:38,599
or are you, like, pissed off?

384
00:15:38,609 --> 00:15:42,059
But like, whatever just can we get this over with like,

385
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:45,179
like most of us with the Ts A when they want to do the pat down

386
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:47,219
those guys, you know what I mean?

387
00:15:47,229 --> 00:15:50,030
Because it's kind of like, yes, I've been through the pat down can we just, like,

388
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:51,460
I would like to go get my,

389
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:51,989
you know,

390
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,520
I'd like to go plug my laptop in and get a beer and just relax before my flight, please.

391
00:15:55,809 --> 00:15:57,169
-- Right.
-- And think about my poor

392
00:15:57,299 --> 00:15:58,169
life choices

393
00:15:58,469 --> 00:15:59,760
and got me here.

394
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,190
Yeah.

395
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:04,969
Right. I, I don't know. I don't know. And, and I guess this is

396
00:16:05,419 --> 00:16:06,809
the other thing to remember too is these are

397
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,510
security measures probably being thought out by people who

398
00:16:10,479 --> 00:16:11,409
aren't.

399
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:13,570
I don't want to say they're not very good at security,

400
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,010
but they're probably not putting a ton of thought into it.

401
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,460
It's just like we have to do something, let's do something quickly. What can we do?

402
00:16:18,469 --> 00:16:21,710
-- Room checks? Boom.
-- You know, that's actually a really good point.

403
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:25,770
Then you just hit on something and you made me think of something else is, is

404
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,299
people love doing security things that they think will make a difference.

405
00:16:30,309 --> 00:16:30,969
But don't,

406
00:16:30,979 --> 00:16:35,099
and the easiest example I'll use is going to something like Blackhead or defcon.

407
00:16:35,109 --> 00:16:37,760
People are always saying, oh, I'll just get a burner phone.

408
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:40,900
Right. And it's like what that doesn't

409
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:44,580
help you, but they think they're doing something important.

410
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:45,340
Right.

411
00:16:45,849 --> 00:16:47,250
And, and I think this is one of the

412
00:16:47,659 --> 00:16:47,859
burner

413
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,049
phone for that place

414
00:16:49,169 --> 00:16:52,750
because people think they're going to get hacked and, and lots of people,

415
00:16:52,989 --> 00:16:53,070
somebody's

416
00:16:53,369 --> 00:16:53,530
gonna

417
00:16:53,789 --> 00:16:54,590
hack you. They'll just

418
00:16:55,859 --> 00:16:56,039
yours.

419
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:59,380
-- Well, exactly. That's right. A
-- burner phone doesn't work. And in fairness. Ok.

420
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:02,479
So in fairness. If, if you have like, especially an android phone,

421
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,170
uh what was it here? Uh Do, do, do,

422
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,380
-- do all
-- of them except the pixel.

423
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:08,058
Yeah,

424
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,828
pretty much all the android phones are like out of the box full

425
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:13,499
of flaws and whether or not your carrier will let you do updates.

426
00:17:13,608 --> 00:17:16,298
Yeah, millions of android devices are vulnerable right out of the box. Yeah.

427
00:17:16,529 --> 00:17:21,409
And sadly, so this is one of the reasons II I choose Apple is because Apple

428
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,180
actually provides security updates for at least three years for their devices.

429
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:27,800
Typically usually about four or five,

430
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,219
right? Like my kids ipods that I bought them.

431
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:33,310
Wow, five years ago now, no, four years ago

432
00:17:33,489 --> 00:17:37,180
are old enough that, you know, they're on I OS 10 and they'll never get updates.

433
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:40,900
But you know, the kids use them to watch uh kids youtube and like play um,

434
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,020
a couple of games.

435
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,020
Ok. Who cares?

436
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:46,630
Their, their ipads, I did, you know, bought them new ones that are up to date. But

437
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,619
yeah, fundamentally, um

438
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:54,189
part of my strategy is I use devices and services where basically if you can hack me,

439
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:54,560
then

440
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,140
you can also hack major banks.

441
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:00,079
So the provider kind of cares like Google or Amazon or Apple.

442
00:18:00,089 --> 00:18:02,319
And by and large, these large guys

443
00:18:02,699 --> 00:18:04,939
are showing that they care now, like they're,

444
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:05,719
you know,

445
00:18:05,729 --> 00:18:10,280
uh Google just announced they're now expanding their bug bounty program to cover

446
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,540
uh service abuse.

447
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,310
Sure. Right. Right. But

448
00:18:13,829 --> 00:18:14,319
I mean,

449
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:18,709
we're still talking about the fundamental point of

450
00:18:18,979 --> 00:18:22,219
normal people want to feel like they're doing something

451
00:18:22,229 --> 00:18:23,869
and they maybe don't know what to do.

452
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,199
And so they're going to do the thing that they think makes sense. And

453
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:31,040
this is one of the tricks I think, especially with a complicated topic.

454
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:35,040
Like security is the things we think make sense don't always make sense.

455
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:36,540
And, and there's,

456
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,310
it's one of those examples where I feel like

457
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,020
whatever I think the answer is it usually isn't.

458
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:46,750
-- And I'm comfortable accepting that. What I think something should be isn't
-- the

459
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:46,989
way

460
00:18:47,469 --> 00:18:50,459
people suggest solutions for traffic problems on Reddit.

461
00:18:50,469 --> 00:18:53,329
And then a traffic engineer will actually step in and drop some truth

462
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:54,310
and,

463
00:18:54,949 --> 00:18:57,060
-- oh,
-- ok.

464
00:18:57,689 --> 00:18:58,739
And I find myself thinking,

465
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,810
legalizing drugs

466
00:19:00,989 --> 00:19:03,670
decreases drug use. Right. And it's like what

467
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:04,910
that doesn't make any for.

468
00:19:06,449 --> 00:19:07,260
Exactly.

469
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:11,550
Yeah. We've got what? Uh, yeah, October 17th here in Canada. Uh, federally it, yeah,

470
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,869
pot will be a thing.

471
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,140
Uh, most of the provinces seem to be on the ball except for Ontario as usual.

472
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,900
-- And,
-- um, and I guess this is, this is the thing, right? With,

473
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,020
with human beings is

474
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:25,689
we,

475
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:29,670
we want to do something but we don't know what something always is.

476
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,880
And, and this is, this is true security, right?

477
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:35,339
It's, it's especially true of security.

478
00:19:35,719 --> 00:19:35,900
Yeah.

479
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,140
Well, the other problem is how many people think of the 2nd and 3rd order effects.

480
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,839
Like my favorite example for this around security is

481
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,300
crime reporting

482
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:46,689
being put in public websites. Right.

483
00:19:46,699 --> 00:19:50,020
So, uh, the Edmonton police has a really good website for this where, you know,

484
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:54,430
they'll show you the crime stats, you know, last 30 days, 60 days, 90 days locations,

485
00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:55,189
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

486
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,390
Uh, what happened in London

487
00:19:58,209 --> 00:20:01,550
is they actually found that this crime reporting stuff online,

488
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,619
like making it all public

489
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:06,939
has actually led to a decrease in some areas of people reporting property crimes.

490
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,229
-- Sure. Right. Nobody wants,
-- they

491
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:09,520
didn't,

492
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,660
-- exactly,
-- they didn't want to bring down their property values.

493
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,489
Yeah. And, and you hear about this as well.

494
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,520
I know with the,

495
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:20,099
the whole immigration issue in the United States is

496
00:20:20,109 --> 00:20:23,260
now that they're cracking down on illegal immigrants.

497
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,739
People who, who live in immigrant,

498
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,819
heavy populated areas aren't reporting crimes because

499
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:30,819
they're worried even if they are legal,

500
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,699
-- they're going to get hassled. So they just don't
-- report crimes.

501
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,000
You mean the people who the immigrant?

502
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:36,349
Oh, yeah,

503
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:38,939
because an immigrant can't report a crime now because they'll get deported.

504
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,189
Well, there's the illegal immigrants, right. Obviously, if they

505
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:44,699
get deported,

506
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:47,400
but there's people who are here legally that are concerned,

507
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,750
-- they're just going to get
-- harassed

508
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,819
legally. Legal immigrants were getting refused entry into the United States.

509
00:20:53,989 --> 00:20:56,510
So the legal immigrants would also be worried.

510
00:20:56,849 --> 00:20:59,500
-- So,
-- so you get the point though, there's all these second

511
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:01,660
level and third level issues and,

512
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,479
and obviously my guess is what, what these hotels were doing is going to have

513
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:09,099
ramifications. They can't imagine

514
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:10,640
at some point

515
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:15,969
-- where II, I don't know
-- because the thing is, especially in Vegas, it's not like you,

516
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,520
you can't not go to these hotels.

517
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,520
And the thing is so the Defcon guy,

518
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:24,609
remember there was a posting a few days ago about how he's like, oh, this sucks.

519
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:26,400
It's terrible. We're going to maybe move the venue

520
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,770
and they're talking about moving it to a different venue except that different

521
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,640
venues owned by the same group that owns little like little Caesars.

522
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,959
Did you just call it Little Caesars?

523
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,130
Is it? Sorry? What

524
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:35,619
Caesars?

525
00:21:35,939 --> 00:21:38,130
Little Caesars is a pizza company.

526
00:21:39,189 --> 00:21:39,339
Sorry,

527
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,250
-- I'm actually really hungry right now.
-- That's fair.

528
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,709
I would, I would rather go to a pizza conference, I think, than a security

529
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:46,140
conference.

530
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:46,699
The

531
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:47,390
pizza conference.

532
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:48,390
I

533
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:48,760
wonder if

534
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,109
-- the vendor
-- hall

535
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,410
it would be,

536
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:55,060
I would be so sick by the end of it. I want to go somewhere.

537
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,989
I'm gonna, I'm gonna look this up and see if there's like a national pizza company.

538
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:00,750
There must be, man, there's like, I would

539
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:01,839
think some companies,

540
00:22:02,209 --> 00:22:04,630
pizza ovens, pizza paddles, whatever. Anyway. Um,

541
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:07,540
but back to this. So, so it's kind of like the online thing.

542
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:11,020
It's like, oh, I'm not going to use Gmail or because Google spies on your email.

543
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,599
Great. Well, because like Microsoft sure as heck doesn't do that.

544
00:22:13,609 --> 00:22:17,239
Oh, wait, everybody does that now. Like that's just how the industry is,

545
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:17,979
you know,

546
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:22,140
um, or it turns out they're all, you know, when people were saying, like, oh,

547
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:22,760
what was it?

548
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:26,329
Git Lab, like, oh, they're using, I forget who was evil that week.

549
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:28,160
And they flipped to somebody else and it's like,

550
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,020
you know, they're on Microsoft and then they went to, I think, Google. Yeah.

551
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:32,880
I think that's what it was.

552
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:35,810
Git lab went from Microsoft to Google or something And everybody was like, well, no,

553
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:36,560
it's less evil.

554
00:22:36,569 --> 00:22:37,359
It's all good. But

555
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,540
I mean,

556
00:22:39,189 --> 00:22:42,229
you know, it's like with hotels you can't just sort of, especially in Vegas,

557
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:44,089
there's the hotels on the strip where

558
00:22:44,339 --> 00:22:45,369
like, no offense. But

559
00:22:45,619 --> 00:22:47,489
if I have to go to Black Hat or defcon,

560
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:51,239
I am absolutely staying in the hotel where it's happening because

561
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,390
walking outside in Vegas or taking an Uber is such

562
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,550
a chore and hassle and it's so disgustingly hot.

563
00:22:56,729 --> 00:22:59,750
-- Uh
-- It is, I was, I was there, it was 100 and 10

564
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:01,030
°F and

565
00:23:01,219 --> 00:23:01,290
Celsius.

566
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:03,670
I don't know. It's a big number, probably like 40

567
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:06,599
and it was, it was crazy.

568
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,979
And I did go outside a couple of times

569
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:13,290
-- and it was, it was, oh
-- jeez, man, that's 43 and a third degrees Celsius. That's,

570
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,260
yeah, it's pretty hot.

571
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,770
It was hot, dude.

572
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:17,780
-- I'm not gonna lie.
-- I,

573
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,790
I've been to Vegas and, and the thing I remember was like, oh,

574
00:23:21,979 --> 00:23:23,939
this is what it's like to live in a hair dryer,

575
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,219
like the inside of a hair dryer. It

576
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:29,579
was, that's what it felt like when you went outside,

577
00:23:29,589 --> 00:23:31,699
it felt like someone was blowing me with a hair dryer.

578
00:23:31,709 --> 00:23:32,099
The whole,

579
00:23:32,209 --> 00:23:36,660
it was, it was crazy. Anyway, anyway, anyway, we are discussing

580
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,500
bizarre security, I guess 2nd and 3rd level effects.

581
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,390
Well, and, and the fact that people

582
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:45,540
try to find a solution or they, it's, I'm trying to help.

583
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,699
Great, but sometimes, you know,

584
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,339
not doing anything is also acceptable. Like,

585
00:23:50,609 --> 00:23:50,900
uh,

586
00:23:51,609 --> 00:23:53,910
well, look at car crashes, right. We're

587
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:57,109
to put it bluntly, we're not doing anything to actually fix car crashes.

588
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:59,660
Like, have we improved driver training? Uh, no,

589
00:23:59,869 --> 00:24:02,369
we've definitely improved cars and there's car

590
00:24:02,489 --> 00:24:02,750
safety

591
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,819
has gone up a ton,

592
00:24:05,329 --> 00:24:07,420
but we're not actually doing anything to

593
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,750
really stop people from driving

594
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:13,459
like idiots apart from removing them from the equation as much as possible.

595
00:24:13,469 --> 00:24:18,000
And, and I, I think that's where security fails a lot is.

596
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:20,880
We are obsessed with training people

597
00:24:21,449 --> 00:24:22,449
every time somebody's like,

598
00:24:22,459 --> 00:24:25,459
we'll just train all the developers to write secure code and I'm like, we can't

599
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,400
train them to write even.

600
00:24:27,609 --> 00:24:28,030
Ok,

601
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:31,250
we, we, first of all, you need working code

602
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:32,089
and that in,

603
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,099
in and of itself is a huge problem. Right?

604
00:24:34,109 --> 00:24:36,430
How many people can't even get their project to work,

605
00:24:36,569 --> 00:24:40,130
let alone get their project to work without really horrible bugs,

606
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,040
let alone to get their project to work without

607
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:45,260
really horrible bugs without really subtle security flaws,

608
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:46,540
right?

609
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,540
So training developers not to write

610
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,369
security flaws is like

611
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:55,689
-- so far down the chain of competency,
-- it's not something you can do. It's impossible.

612
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:59,530
Right. We might as well train developers to look for Yetis.

613
00:24:59,949 --> 00:25:01,819
I mean, that is the same thing.

614
00:25:02,069 --> 00:25:04,199
Open BS D and Open SSH can't even do it.

615
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,520
And all they basically care about is security.

616
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,420
They're literally the smartest people on the planet and they

617
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,400
screw it up if they can't get it right.

618
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,449
There's literally no hope.

619
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:16,780
They're one of the few groups willing to sacrifice features for security.

620
00:25:16,869 --> 00:25:18,569
That's true. They are and they still speak

621
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:18,930
up.

622
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,119
Yep. You know,

623
00:25:22,569 --> 00:25:27,089
and I mean, can you imagine trying to convince Google or, well, not even Google,

624
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:29,569
imagine convincing anybody with a software product

625
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,469
to cut features because it'll make the product more secure.

626
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:32,859
Uh

627
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,500
You're gonna get fired.

628
00:25:34,959 --> 00:25:35,790
Yes,

629
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,469
I don't, I don't imagine anybody doing that. And

630
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,500
more importantly,

631
00:25:41,869 --> 00:25:43,349
is it going to matter?

632
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:45,750
I mean, the answer is probably not,

633
00:25:46,099 --> 00:25:47,040
not really, no.

634
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:51,660
And that's not to say we shouldn't maybe drop some legacy stuff and features like,

635
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:54,839
you know, dropping ts 1.0 or dropping ts 1.1 or,

636
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,349
you know, dropping

637
00:25:57,069 --> 00:25:58,339
support for, you know,

638
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:02,170
things that are now understood to be really dangerous and actually not that useful.

639
00:26:03,109 --> 00:26:04,719
And so there is some of that, which is good.

640
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:10,300
Um But by and large, yeah, it's, those are corner cases, not the standard

641
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,760
Right. And, and definitely not training.

642
00:26:13,449 --> 00:26:13,989
No.

643
00:26:14,719 --> 00:26:15,670
Yeah, it's

644
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:19,719
actually, you've got me thinking now because you're right. When, when there are,

645
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:22,739
when there are car accidents or there's something happens.

646
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:26,339
Nobody ever says we need to train the drivers better.

647
00:26:26,349 --> 00:26:28,550
It's always, we need to make the cars safer.

648
00:26:28,819 --> 00:26:31,280
-- Well, yeah, we, we gave up on that a long time ago.
-- Like,

649
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,839
right. And, and I,

650
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:35,150
we suck at that in computer security.

651
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:37,170
We, we suck at it so bad.

652
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,359
I mean, look at the number of places that do, like root cause incident analysis and,

653
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:45,099
you know, some of them there's a few that do, uh, cloud floor and Google come to mind.

654
00:26:45,109 --> 00:26:48,310
Right. They, they post those really big long, good write ups and they really,

655
00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:49,849
and you'll notice that

656
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:54,130
they talk about doing a whole bunch of, not just to solve this specific problem,

657
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,109
but in general like, oh,

658
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:57,319
we're going to be more careful about how we pushed production.

659
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:59,880
We're going to have more checks and balances, you know, we're going to have more,

660
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:00,479
you know what I mean?

661
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,189
It's like the whole air incident,

662
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,040
you know, crash investigation thing where it's like, ok,

663
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,439
why did this mechanic screw up?

664
00:27:06,449 --> 00:27:08,650
Well, you know, he screwed up because, oh,

665
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:12,260
it turns out like the flight crews and mechanics getting enough sleep is important.

666
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:13,079
Right.

667
00:27:13,229 --> 00:27:14,800
Unfortunately, it's hard to regulate.

668
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:16,839
But, you know, we're at least aware of it and we try,

669
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:17,959
you know, I mean,

670
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:22,599
how many computer software places actually have a policy of like,

671
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,560
maybe we shouldn't put all these random software developers

672
00:27:25,569 --> 00:27:27,829
on call 24 hours a day to fix stuff

673
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,319
to make sure that they get enough sleep so that they don't like,

674
00:27:30,439 --> 00:27:31,469
write bad code.

675
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,680
I'd be shocked if anybody had that policy

676
00:27:34,849 --> 00:27:38,349
and it would, that'd be really interesting actually to, to map like,

677
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:39,760
code quality and,

678
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,719
and volume versus

679
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,439
like what,

680
00:27:42,449 --> 00:27:44,260
what someone's schedule looked like where they were

681
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,400
maybe working really late one night or,

682
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,520
or something like that.

683
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:49,339
The

684
00:27:49,569 --> 00:27:49,890
reality is we

685
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,959
know that people,

686
00:27:51,089 --> 00:27:52,369
when people don't get enough sleep,

687
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:57,359
they're cognitively impaired to wrap very rapidly to a high degree.

688
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:57,959
Like it,

689
00:27:58,199 --> 00:28:00,910
it doesn't take a lot of lacking sleep to,

690
00:28:01,459 --> 00:28:03,400
for people to be pretty useless.

691
00:28:05,589 --> 00:28:07,369
Uh, especially it's something as, you know,

692
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,119
creative and as sophisticated as writing code.

693
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:13,369
Right? Like people who are tired can keep a car on the highway

694
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:13,750
most

695
00:28:14,329 --> 00:28:16,280
of the time. No, most of the time,

696
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,290
you know,

697
00:28:17,459 --> 00:28:20,280
and that's a relatively simple task compared

698
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:22,520
to like writing some code implementing,

699
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,689
you know, a complicated business concept.

700
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:31,069
-- Right? That, that's a pretty high cognitive task.
-- It is. I, I agree. I agree.

701
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:32,099
I, I feel like

702
00:28:33,189 --> 00:28:34,199
this is

703
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:39,449
we just keep talking about this. Like people are the problem, right?

704
00:28:39,459 --> 00:28:40,849
And the solution is always

705
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,449
the problem, less people doing stuff

706
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:43,989
and

707
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,660
technology that helps the people and make

708
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:49,339
sure like things like lane departure if every

709
00:28:49,349 --> 00:28:51,469
single car on the highway had lane departure

710
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:53,729
and the you're about to rear end somebody

711
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:57,839
-- that would definitely cut down a big pile of accident.
-- It certainly would.

712
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:02,910
And, and when it comes to security, we have remarkably few guardrails.

713
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,189
Here's a great hypothetical.

714
00:29:04,199 --> 00:29:07,310
Imagine if everybody had a continuous integration system

715
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,319
and actual

716
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:15,150
code tests and function tests and unit tests and actual smoke tests and actual,

717
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,050
like we build the product and have a thing.

718
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,699
Click through the web U I test.

719
00:29:18,979 --> 00:29:21,410
That would be fantastic. That would be amazing.

720
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,089
And we will never get there.

721
00:29:24,859 --> 00:29:27,930
I'd be shocked if even 1% of software has that

722
00:29:28,689 --> 00:29:31,550
and, and does it matter? Right.

723
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:34,910
I don't know. I don't, I, apparently not because the world keeps spinning

724
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,239
and, and that's the thing.

725
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:40,849
I mean, I, I have a feeling it will matter in something like automotive or meds

726
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:45,219
because some group is going to make it matter. But, but for like,

727
00:29:45,469 --> 00:29:48,939
you know, I'll pick on Slack for a service like Slack

728
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:49,920
is, is

729
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:51,849
right? Granted, they do a good

730
00:29:51,969 --> 00:29:52,000
job.

731
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,689
They actually do a really good job.

732
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,500
But, you know what I mean? Like,

733
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:55,729
I,

734
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:58,579
I, there's so many little startupy type

735
00:29:58,709 --> 00:30:01,619
services that have terrible security and it's

736
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,979
probably never going to make a difference,

737
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:06,719
-- you know? Well,
-- they have so many real existential threats trying to kill them.

738
00:30:06,729 --> 00:30:07,310
But like,

739
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,979
basically if, if security becomes your problem, you've, you've won,

740
00:30:11,449 --> 00:30:14,119
you've survived long enough for it to be a problem. Right.

741
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,619
That's a really good point.

742
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:17,420
And, you know, really interesting.

743
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,750
I mean, for security to matter,

744
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,319
you actually have to have users and value in your system

745
00:30:23,729 --> 00:30:24,630
-- and,
-- and like money. Right.

746
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,660
And how many start up never get there.

747
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:29,020
Most of them,

748
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,800
like 98%.

749
00:30:32,449 --> 00:30:36,290
Right. Right. That's interesting. You know, that's, that's a really good point.

750
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:36,319
Uh,

751
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,020
I, I think we should, we should call it there as our, our episode,

752
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,979
which show notes were filled with,

753
00:30:43,189 --> 00:30:44,280
with ideas

754
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,359
and we got to do, who

755
00:30:47,209 --> 00:30:51,300
-- cares?
-- I mean, oh, guys, guess what another speculative execution

756
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:52,650
because,

757
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:53,699
well,

758
00:30:53,709 --> 00:30:56,949
because we did all this black magic to make computers faster and as it

759
00:30:56,959 --> 00:31:00,060
turns out some of it was kind of running around with scissors dangerous.

760
00:31:01,469 --> 00:31:01,500
Uh,

761
00:31:01,829 --> 00:31:03,260
-- you
-- know, that happened.

762
00:31:03,819 --> 00:31:04,060
Yeah,

763
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:05,609
it's anyway,

764
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:07,030
and it's gonna keep happening.

765
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,410
It's like,

766
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,900
it's like people who write web products and they're

767
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,000
shocked when there's cross site security flaws in them.

768
00:31:12,229 --> 00:31:13,550
That's just the nature of it.

769
00:31:13,949 --> 00:31:15,880
Yep. Yep. That's exactly right.

770
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,650
It's,

771
00:31:17,099 --> 00:31:17,609
oh, well,

772
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,930
-- I
-- buy canned beans.

773
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:22,170
That's right.

774
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:27,680
Stack up until the canned beans get too old and kill your botulism or something. So

775
00:31:27,939 --> 00:31:31,199
you can't win. Like, there's, there's no, there's no way out.

776
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:32,459
-- Oh,
-- funny story.

777
00:31:32,469 --> 00:31:32,660
I, uh,

778
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,229
I watched a youtube video the other day and I

779
00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:35,969
actually learned how to use a can opener correctly.

780
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:37,170
I've been using it wrong.

781
00:31:37,349 --> 00:31:38,930
What kind of can opener?

782
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,089
Uh, like the rolling one, I've been putting it.

783
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:44,630
So I've been cutting through the top of the lid, not the side of the lid.

784
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,930
And they suggest you cut through the side.

785
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,760
Yeah. And it rolls it.

786
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:50,839
That's actually how you're supposed to use a can opener as it turns

787
00:31:50,849 --> 00:31:52,780
out because it rolls the edge and you don't get a sharp edge

788
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,180
and it also takes the entire thing off.

789
00:31:55,439 --> 00:31:56,900
And so there's no lip

790
00:31:57,239 --> 00:31:57,500
for,

791
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:58,449
to get

792
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,219
-- caught
-- on my, uh, I bought one of those can openers that like cuts.

793
00:32:02,229 --> 00:32:06,560
It's purposely meant to do that where it like cuts around the edge of the cans

794
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,060
because I got sick of cutting myself.

795
00:32:09,199 --> 00:32:11,069
Well, but that's what normal ones do as well.

796
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,930
Normal ones can do this too.

797
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,150
I haven't either. I mean,

798
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:14,900
I

799
00:32:15,089 --> 00:32:15,250
think,

800
00:32:15,489 --> 00:32:15,550
I

801
00:32:15,709 --> 00:32:15,989
think that,

802
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,189
you know what, I think the trauma,

803
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,369
well, here's the thing, I think the reason is

804
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,750
because when we invented canned food,

805
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,270
we didn't invent can openers for about another 50 years.

806
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:28,579
And so the way you open a can with like a, a tool is you, you know,

807
00:32:28,589 --> 00:32:31,400
you punch in through the top and you, you knife it open basically, right?

808
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:31,660
Like ridiculous

809
00:32:31,939 --> 00:32:33,089
army knife. I can actually do this.

810
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:33,640
It's,

811
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:37,719
it results in basically the most dangerous thing you can possibly hold in your hand

812
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:38,599
is,

813
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,290
yeah.

814
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,199
But anyway, so, and I think that's why I,

815
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:44,800
I always used a can opener that way was punching through the top because that's how

816
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:46,760
you do it with like a mechanical tool.

817
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:50,609
And it just never occurred to me to put it on 90 degrees sideways.

818
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,000
And it turns out it works much better.

819
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:55,619
-- It's easier and it works much.
-- II

820
00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:00,420
I want to go try this. Now, after we stop talking, I've never done that before.

821
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,979
We'll have to post a video to it.

822
00:33:03,449 --> 00:33:06,270
It's a video of Kurt slicing his hand open.

823
00:33:07,459 --> 00:33:08,689
Well, it's like when I learned I was,

824
00:33:08,859 --> 00:33:11,239
I was opening bananas from the wrong end because again,

825
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:13,949
I saw monkeys at the zoo doing it on a youtube video and I was like,

826
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:17,459
-- you're supposed
-- to open bananas from the end without the little knob.

827
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:18,420
Yeah,

828
00:33:18,959 --> 00:33:21,989
you hold the knob and then you just pinch the top and peel it.

829
00:33:22,989 --> 00:33:25,260
It's much easier. You don't have to saw it open with a key around it.

830
00:33:27,189 --> 00:33:29,849
I, but you saw your bananas over with a knife. What are you eating?

831
00:33:29,859 --> 00:33:31,050
Like green bananas?

832
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:34,689
Well, no, no, no, because I used to like, try and crack the top and if it didn't crack,

833
00:33:34,699 --> 00:33:36,199
you know, you get kind of mushy at the top.

834
00:33:36,209 --> 00:33:39,839
So I cut it with a knife or saw it with my key. If I didn't have a knife handy

835
00:33:40,939 --> 00:33:43,130
and crack it open and hold it from the bottom,

836
00:33:43,459 --> 00:33:46,170
hold it from the stem and pinch and peel,

837
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:47,030
I'm

838
00:33:47,229 --> 00:33:47,589
gonna,

839
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:51,369
you might not be wrong. But I don't, I'm never gonna do that.

840
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,719
In fact, I don't even like bananas very much, but

841
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,449
I, I feel like you're,

842
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:56,839
no, no, you know, you are,

843
00:33:56,849 --> 00:33:59,510
you're like the weirdo who does everything wrong and people are just, like,

844
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,599
look at that weird guy

845
00:34:00,959 --> 00:34:03,359
and then they don't listen to you because they assume you're a lunatic.

846
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:07,680
And so I'm not going to do that because I have enough trouble relating to people.

847
00:34:07,689 --> 00:34:08,850
Like, I don't need

848
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:11,040
to be eating my bananas upside down, right?

849
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:14,899
Like here everyone come eat bananas and open cans with me. You know,

850
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:17,120
I don't need that. I have enough problems

851
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:20,958
anyway. All right, sweet. I'm calling it, man. Thank you. Thank you, Kurt.

852
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:22,478
