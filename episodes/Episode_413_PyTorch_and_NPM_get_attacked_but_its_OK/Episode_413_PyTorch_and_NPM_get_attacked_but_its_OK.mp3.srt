Hello and welcome to a special late night edition

1
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,079
of the Open source Security podcast with myself,

2
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,399
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

3
00:00:12,409 --> 00:00:13,430
Josh Pressers.

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,460
Oh, we're back to Thought Crime. That's exciting.

5
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:15,500
I,

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,950
I have the coolest thing in that I've ever shared with

7
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:20,510
you that I'm going to tell you about right now.

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,870
So we're recording on, it is a late

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,309
for us in the evening. It's just when I would have normally been getting started.

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,430
-- My younger days,
-- my bedtime is coming up in a few hours.

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,299
But anyway,

12
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,389
so games done quick is coming to an end.

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,930
This is literally the last day of it that I'm talking to you.

14
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:41,240
I'm, I'm putting aside my games done quick time to talk to you this evening.

15
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:42,389
Just so, you know that

16
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,880
it's, they're all on youtube anyway.

17
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:45,520
And it's nice.

18
00:00:45,529 --> 00:00:47,979
They're, they're showing up on youtube like two hours after the run,

19
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,349
which is very abnormal.

20
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,069
-- Usually it took like weeks.
-- Are they edited or just raw?

21
00:00:52,599 --> 00:00:57,049
Uh, I mean, they're cut to the correct length. There's no editing to be done.

22
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,729
It's just the live stream. But anyway,

23
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,250
there was a run

24
00:01:00,419 --> 00:01:03,529
done. Maybe Monday or Tuesday. I forget what day

25
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:08,129
a guy trained his dog to play video games.

26
00:01:08,419 --> 00:01:09,150
It was,

27
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:12,330
it was so good. And which game?

28
00:01:12,919 --> 00:01:13,080
Uh Gyre?

29
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:14,400
So Gyra

30
00:01:14,589 --> 00:01:15,489
has the

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,779
Kurt's looking it up right now.

32
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:18,889
No one knows what

33
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,330
Gyre is. Don't feel bad.

34
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:23,639
It's the one, remember the, the weird robot from Nintendo,

35
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:24,160
Rob?

36
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,980
-- I wanted that so much.
-- Right. Gyre

37
00:01:27,309 --> 00:01:28,980
was the game the robot played.

38
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:30,900
Anyway, this guy taught his dog,

39
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,199
he would point at a button on the special controller

40
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:35,099
and the dog would basically hold down the button.

41
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:39,510
It was absolutely fantastic. And it's so good. I'll put a link in the show notes.

42
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:43,459
But it, like, it is the best speed run I have ever seen in my life.

43
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:47,889
-- Anyway. Anyway,
-- I just, what was that movie where the, uh, with the

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,889
-- Nez glove and uh
-- the Wizard?

45
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,500
Yes. Thank you. The Wizard.

46
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,529
-- Uh uh
-- Fred Savage.

47
00:01:55,419 --> 00:01:58,389
It was a commercial for Super Mario Brothers three. That's what the whole

48
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:58,629
movie

49
00:01:59,089 --> 00:01:59,410
with that.

50
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,669
Yeah, it was, it was good. It was,

51
00:02:00,949 --> 00:02:03,319
well, it's not a good movie at, at all, but when I was a kid,

52
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,610
like I wanted to see it so bad.

53
00:02:04,809 --> 00:02:07,089
I wanted the glove. I wanted the robot.

54
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:07,290
Oh,

55
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:09,050
so I, I used to own a power glove.

56
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:11,910
I don't know if you knew that this is apparently a video game episode now.

57
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,820
But yeah, it's funny because like, and then as an adult,

58
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,679
I also wanted a power glove because then you can, like,

59
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,289
hack them to talk to your computer.

60
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,559
And that's what I did. I, I had one in college and I

61
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,880
made my power glove control a robotic arm.

62
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:27,520
And apparently I know I've been out of college,

63
00:02:27,529 --> 00:02:31,389
like 20 years at this point and apparently the glove is still in a case

64
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,000
in the

65
00:02:32,649 --> 00:02:33,600
environment,

66
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:38,820
-- but they're really expensive now. I mean, I literally gave it to the school.
-- Do it.

67
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,639
It's like it's like a Microsoft connect, right?

68
00:02:40,649 --> 00:02:42,509
Those things are impossible to get hold of. Now.

69
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,589
I have one in my basement, I think. Anyway.

70
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,059
-- Ok, we have a real topic, video games, unfortunately
-- today. Yeah.

71
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:51,429
-- So Pie Torch got hacked. Well, kind of sort
-- of did they?

72
00:02:52,149 --> 00:02:54,979
Yeah, I mean, I would say from an intent point of view they got hacked.

73
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,550
Now, luckily it wasn't like a malicious hacker. It was a classical

74
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,779
I could hack you but I'm not going to hack you kind of thing.

75
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:05,919
Well, there, there's kind of, I think two stories that,

76
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:07,509
that I are tied together that,

77
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,850
that you and I have passed around for the last like week or so p torches one.

78
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,490
But then also

79
00:03:13,649 --> 00:03:18,539
there's a story about an N PM rat, a remote access Trojan that was found

80
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,250
and that also ties into some research aqua

81
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:24,289
security did around deprecated N PM packages.

82
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,559
And I feel like this is just,

83
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,940
I'm gonna say it's a supply chain grab bag of fun.

84
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:29,979
You know,

85
00:03:30,619 --> 00:03:31,850
the cause of all this is

86
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:34,630
uh can we, who should we blame?

87
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:35,990
No, no, no. There's a very

88
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,630
-- simple
-- blame dice that

89
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,229
there's a very simple root

90
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,270
cause for all this failure and it is efficiency.

91
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,830
I know why you said that and you're not wrong but it definitely needs an explanation.

92
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:51,089
Oh yeah. No, this is like the, the the six levels down of like why did this plane crash?

93
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,300
Because the guy sneezed because he didn't blow his nose.

94
00:03:53,309 --> 00:03:56,139
It's no, a better example would be the Malcolm in the middle.

95
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:59,669
Change the light bulb to the garage where the guys

96
00:04:00,649 --> 00:04:01,259
he goes,

97
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,309
-- we have to get a light bulb or the door,
-- the sticky drawer,

98
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:05,589
right.

99
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,009
The door doesn't open. Right. We got to get a screwdriver.

100
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,110
Oh, the screwdriver drawer doesn't work. Right.

101
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:14,210
And he is changing his oil and his wife's like, can you change this light bulb?

102
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,910
He's like, what do you think I'm doing

103
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,630
anyway? But yes, that is exactly right.

104
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,730
So Pytorch is,

105
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,048
uh,

106
00:04:21,748 --> 00:04:26,009
kind of an important Python library for A I stuff.

107
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,848
It's like the library that runs probably 90% of the A I on the planet.

108
00:04:30,989 --> 00:04:33,688
-- Probably more like 99.
-- Ok.

109
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,779
The bigger stuff.

110
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:37,649
-- That's fair.
-- Yeah.

111
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,959
So it's just a little important because the thing, this is what I love.

112
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,980
I was like, I'm, I'm a Python used to have been forever and Python comes from big data.

113
00:04:44,989 --> 00:04:47,500
Right. Guido Van Rossen worked at the Italian supercomputer center.

114
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,630
So Python has always been

115
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:50,510
big data

116
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,470
and

117
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,010
a natural extension of big data obviously is A I, right, those two camps

118
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,769
kind of live next to each other.

119
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,339
And so Python is,

120
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,890
I'm going to say a resurgence, but it really never went away.

121
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:08,000
It's been, yeah, it's been like top 10 language for probably 20 years or so now,

122
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,929
-- at least
-- like it is dominating

123
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:13,890
-- A
-- I it's, it's dominated a lot of data.

124
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:18,393
You got stuff like panda and numpy and fuzzy wuzzy. Like just things.

125
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:22,893
Yeah, Python does a ton of cool stuff and it's so easy, it's so easy to use.

126
00:05:22,903 --> 00:05:27,032
And what I love is like stuff like fuzzy wuzzy and, and numpty and panda are, you know,

127
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:30,562
written in sea or whatever and are just super optimized out the wazoo

128
00:05:30,572 --> 00:05:33,523
and super capable libraries that do insanely

129
00:05:33,532 --> 00:05:36,643
complicated stuff with data and language.

130
00:05:36,653 --> 00:05:39,295
-- And so
-- I have, I have a funny story about that actually.

131
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:42,175
So I remember when I was doing a bunch of work,

132
00:05:42,186 --> 00:05:44,536
when I was doing like some Bitcoin analysis stuff.

133
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:47,835
I didn't talk about it long ago. I'll see if I can dig it up at some point. But anyway,

134
00:05:48,105 --> 00:05:53,216
there was one point where I had like, I think it was 60 million basically bits of data

135
00:05:53,466 --> 00:05:54,955
that I needed to do something with.

136
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:58,615
And I was like, I wonder if I can just put these in a Python dictionary.

137
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:01,760
And, yeah, and it worked perfectly and I, I told a data nerd.

138
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:04,380
I know that he's like, oh, yeah, you can go way higher than 60 million.

139
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:07,239
I was like, what? That, that seems like ridiculous to me.

140
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,380
And when you look at Hitler stuff like how panda loads data, it's like,

141
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,260
it's engineered to load a lot of data.

142
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,959
Yeah. I wasn't doing anything.

143
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,820
I was using a literal Python dictionary

144
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,170
and it loaded up 60 million records and

145
00:06:23,179 --> 00:06:25,119
then I was like sorting them and searching them

146
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,450
at ridiculous speeds.

147
00:06:26,489 --> 00:06:29,630
I've done this forever where I use like I just use keyed

148
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,420
dictionaries to like basically sort in unique stuff based on the keys

149
00:06:33,549 --> 00:06:34,140
and just,

150
00:06:34,619 --> 00:06:37,290
I've literally never thought about how big is it

151
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,200
anyway. OK. OK. Python is a great language. Sure. We all know that

152
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,320
-- what happened to Pytorch.
-- So Pytorch lives in github

153
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,070
-- shocker,
-- like everything else does

154
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,119
pretty much all of the open source,

155
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:49,809
pretty

156
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:50,160
much.

157
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:53,040
There's still a little bit of it somehow left in

158
00:06:53,049 --> 00:06:55,040
source horch which I find so bizarre every time I

159
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:56,890
end up there and I have to download something from

160
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:58,880
there because it's kind of still very dodgy feeling.

161
00:06:58,890 --> 00:06:59,579
But anyways

162
00:06:59,739 --> 00:07:01,820
and there is some in git lab, but by and large github

163
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:02,619
is the winner

164
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,130
of this.

165
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:04,859
Github

166
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:07,619
wants to make life easier for developers, right?

167
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,809
And so they've done some like some conceptually

168
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,019
simple stuff like we basically will host your

169
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,109
GIT, we will Oh, we have an issues tracker, we have a project thing with Kan

170
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:17,679
boards

171
00:07:17,829 --> 00:07:20,279
and they've also done some stuff that is

172
00:07:20,869 --> 00:07:22,179
quite complicated,

173
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,059
but

174
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:25,359
I guess it's intended to probably

175
00:07:25,369 --> 00:07:28,410
reduce developer friction and community friction.

176
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:30,049
And so things like

177
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,549
there's settings where, you know, oh, if you contribute,

178
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:35,359
uh if you commit to this project is accepted,

179
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,989
you can be a contributor except it's kind of an automatic

180
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,299
plague setting. Apparently

181
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,149
-- not necessarily. So, this one, what happened?
-- Is it a default or not?

182
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,100
-- See, I wasn't clear on that.
-- It's not a default. No, it's not default.

183
00:07:49,109 --> 00:07:53,059
So what, but what? So what happened here with Pytorch was these researchers?

184
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:53,950
Basically,

185
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,019
they realized that the

186
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,899
way Pytorch would run C I jobs in non github

187
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,459
hosted environments because there's like different ways to run C I and the github

188
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:09,200
hosted C I is shockingly secure. Apparently I shouldn't say shockingly

189
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,290
it's better.

190
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:14,440
Well, it's just, it's, but it's piggybacking on Azure. So it's containers and V MS.

191
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:18,329
Well, sure. And it's, it's, they, they,

192
00:08:18,619 --> 00:08:20,690
they don't recycle anything like they throw it

193
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,609
all away and start again fresh every time,

194
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,779
-- which is how you should do it.
-- Right. Yes, exactly. Everyone throw everything

195
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,170
away.

196
00:08:26,299 --> 00:08:29,390
Well, not even for security, but just so that your build is clean and not

197
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,400
-- depending on magic from another build.
-- That's complicated.

198
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:35,280
It's a long story because there anyway, I'm not getting into it today.

199
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,000
So,

200
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,400
what happened with Pytorch was these researchers found

201
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:41,190
that Pytorch was running what they call it,

202
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,440
like they called, like self hosted.

203
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:42,719
C I,

204
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,669
I forget the exact terminology they use

205
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,309
but

206
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:48,979
so they're running like the self hosted C I, and it reused

207
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:50,179
environments

208
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,000
between certain runs and I don't know exactly if it,

209
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,820
I'm sure it threw things away occasionally.

210
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,940
I don't, I don't know all the details here. But anyway,

211
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,059
that part of it is like environmental variables,

212
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,859
recycling them between runs could be useful.

213
00:09:00,869 --> 00:09:02,809
But again, I would say in anyways. Well,

214
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,130
yeah, anyway,

215
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:09,679
so what ends up happening is they realize that Pytorch has a configuration setting.

216
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,700
So I I should say, OK,

217
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,570
so the the way this often works is like if I

218
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,630
submit APR a pull request and get hub to a project,

219
00:09:16,969 --> 00:09:19,989
it doesn't just like run the tests, right? The

220
00:09:20,219 --> 00:09:22,039
pull request is, is sent

221
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,530
and then a developer has to look at it.

222
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:28,080
And the developer from the project would be like, OK, this looks like a good commit.

223
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:31,080
Let's run the test, click this button, run the test now.

224
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:34,039
But if you're a member of the project quite often,

225
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:36,650
the test will just run because the assumption

226
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,359
is that members of projects are trusted.

227
00:09:39,849 --> 00:09:40,789
And so

228
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:43,919
like the test should run because you want the test

229
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:45,710
to run and you get your feedback real fast.

230
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,229
All that jazz, right? Like very dev

231
00:09:47,469 --> 00:09:47,539
ops,

232
00:09:47,669 --> 00:09:48,369
all that stuff

233
00:09:48,869 --> 00:09:49,280
now.

234
00:09:49,469 --> 00:09:52,039
So what happened was these folks figured out that

235
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:57,119
Pytorch had a setting, not just for members of project but

236
00:09:57,223 --> 00:10:00,603
for anyone who had a poll request accepted in

237
00:10:00,612 --> 00:10:04,362
the past being maybe this person is trustworthy.

238
00:10:04,372 --> 00:10:07,843
Right. Maybe, maybe not. I don't know. Now, so what happened was

239
00:10:07,973 --> 00:10:08,643
they,

240
00:10:09,043 --> 00:10:12,322
they submitted a Typo Fix

241
00:10:12,562 --> 00:10:14,833
to Pie Torch because obviously, like

242
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:19,682
any reasonably sized project has typo somewhere and you can totally fix them

243
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,046
and they're usually pretty quick about accepting these things.

244
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:25,325
So like, oh, they, they fix like four words, whatever, good enough except, you know,

245
00:10:25,335 --> 00:10:26,125
no big deal.

246
00:10:26,135 --> 00:10:26,986
It's a read me.

247
00:10:26,995 --> 00:10:31,245
Now, once these researchers got that commit accepted,

248
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:34,005
which they literally did this with this intent, right?

249
00:10:34,015 --> 00:10:36,515
It wasn't like they accidentally did this along the way.

250
00:10:36,526 --> 00:10:38,286
They knew once they got that accepted,

251
00:10:38,445 --> 00:10:42,205
now, they could create a poor request that had malicious content,

252
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,190
right?

253
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:48,270
And that malicious content was designed to attack the self hosted runners.

254
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,260
I don't recall exactly why you can't attack github

255
00:10:51,369 --> 00:10:51,739
runners.

256
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,549
I think it's because they're thrown away each time, but don't quote me on that.

257
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,090
But anyway, so

258
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,049
they create a poll request.

259
00:10:58,059 --> 00:11:02,260
The thing that makes it brilliant is they made the poll request a draft poll request.

260
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:02,460
Now, I

261
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,299
know there's a concept called the draft pull request where I could,

262
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:10,570
let's say I have a poll request I'm working on and I want to be like, hey, developer,

263
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,809
I would like an opinion on like this particular thing I'm doing.

264
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,450
But the purpose of a draft is you

265
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,789
can't like accidentally accept it because goodness knows,

266
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:22,549
more than once I went to review something for someone and I hit, you know,

267
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:26,770
merge instead of like something else I meant to click.

268
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,190
So anyway,

269
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,109
that's kind of the purpose of draft this pull request

270
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:33,429
as drafts also doesn't show up in anyone's like radar.

271
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,909
So no one even knows this thing is running crap on their runners.

272
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:39,950
And then like the article goes into all the shenanigans they could

273
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,919
do and they basically could have taken over the Pytorch project.

274
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:45,880
That's the thing with any complex system, there's gonna be

275
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:47,039
clause

276
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:47,849
for sure.

277
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:48,950
That's just how it is.

278
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,039
And so it's like, you know, I keep coming back to the whole thing if,

279
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:52,500
if you gave me a billion dollars taught at

280
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,840
the Linux kernel and say it's security bug free.

281
00:11:54,849 --> 00:11:59,229
Would you bet your life on it? Of course not. Would you even a $10,000 to review?

282
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:01,390
I throw a heck of a party,

283
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,239
you know, like given

284
00:12:03,609 --> 00:12:06,000
$10,000 and a lot of effort to review

285
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:07,213
organizations, github

286
00:12:07,382 --> 00:12:09,593
settings and repo settings and configurations.

287
00:12:09,742 --> 00:12:13,112
Would you bet that there's no way to hack into them with something clever like this?

288
00:12:13,122 --> 00:12:14,492
No, of course not. Like there's,

289
00:12:14,982 --> 00:12:15,413
well github,

290
00:12:15,572 --> 00:12:16,692
I bet, I bet a github

291
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:20,663
organization has hundreds to thousands of settings

292
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:23,973
that can be twiddled. Like it's an amazing project.

293
00:12:23,982 --> 00:12:26,353
I used to look through the settings once in a while just

294
00:12:26,362 --> 00:12:28,622
to see what was new stuff there because this is a,

295
00:12:28,632 --> 00:12:30,872
this is a challenge I have with being a cloud.

296
00:12:30,963 --> 00:12:33,033
Ain I literally have had like where somebody's like, Kirk,

297
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,232
can you change this permission setting in Google Drive?

298
00:12:35,606 --> 00:12:36,015
No,

299
00:12:36,176 --> 00:12:38,736
no, I can't. They're like, yes you can. And I'm like, what? And he's like,

300
00:12:38,856 --> 00:12:41,375
I'm like, no, you have to add a, you have to do and he's like, yeah, you can do that now.

301
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,645
And I'm like, what? Right click and like,

302
00:12:43,026 --> 00:12:48,145
oh yeah, you can a perfect example. Somebody at the CS A wanted Zapp year for teams.

303
00:12:48,245 --> 00:12:50,745
And I'm like, oh jeez, I don't know. The last time I looked, it was pretty expensive.

304
00:12:50,755 --> 00:12:51,786
So I looked at it again.

305
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:52,226
Yeah,

306
00:12:52,236 --> 00:12:55,575
we had to pay an extra $22 for the year prepaid to go upgrade to

307
00:12:55,585 --> 00:12:58,375
teams because it's the same price effectively as

308
00:12:58,385 --> 00:13:01,056
our existing grandfather doesn't exist anymore plans.

309
00:13:01,556 --> 00:13:01,726
And that

310
00:13:01,926 --> 00:13:04,695
-- like, I can't keep up with all this. But
-- anyway, anyway,

311
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,869
now here is the one thing I will say, no,

312
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,140
-- I think
-- that's actually an important thing because these blank is of service

313
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:15,239
providers are constantly adding new features and they have to pick a default

314
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:18,960
and quite often they pick a default where they want it to work for people.

315
00:13:18,969 --> 00:13:21,799
-- I
-- mean, for sure, for sure, but that's not the case here.

316
00:13:21,849 --> 00:13:24,359
-- Well,
-- no, no, but I'm just saying in general, but like

317
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,219
-- to for security people to stay on top of this. I don't know how we can, we
-- can't.

318
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,679
That's the reality, I think.

319
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,020
-- And I'm paid to do this. Like the pytorch people are not. Oh, for
-- sure.

320
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,219
Well, some of them might be.

321
00:13:34,229 --> 00:13:36,700
I don't, I don't know exactly what the structure of py torch is.

322
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,140
-- They're
-- probably not paid to go through github

323
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,010
-- repo settings.
-- Uh, probably not.

324
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:43,489
And look, you, you raise a good point though, of the fact is

325
00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:46,390
there is so much complexity in a lot of

326
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,309
this stuff that securing it is virtually impossible.

327
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,349
Now, here's the one thing I would say though, in most instances,

328
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:58,210
if there is an attack like this against Pytorch,

329
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,830
like let's say the developers like went

330
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,830
the extra mile and they started actually attacking it.

331
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,070
I think there's a high probability it would have been detected

332
00:14:07,349 --> 00:14:10,530
because Pytorch is widely used by a lot of people.

333
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:13,890
We're back to the open source thing of it only takes one person to say, hey,

334
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,010
I saw this weird thing and for it to be in github

335
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:19,070
issue or on hacker news and it goes kaboom real fast.

336
00:14:19,349 --> 00:14:21,669
Yeah, the th this is why I went into open source,

337
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:25,030
I got into security and I was running both Windows and

338
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,070
Os two and Linux.

339
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,409
And I very quickly realized with Linux, I had documentation,

340
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:31,849
source code manual pages, all that good stuff.

341
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,409
It was awesome.

342
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:37,299
And I realized from a security perspective I can take some courses on windows,

343
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:37,890
which I did,

344
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,289
but I can never really know what's going on and I looked at what

345
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:43,539
these windows security people were doing and this is back in the late nineties.

346
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:43,729
Right.

347
00:14:43,739 --> 00:14:47,419
And so, like, the people that could work G DB and actually debug a windows thing and,

348
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:47,530
like,

349
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,455
you know, understand what's going on.

350
00:14:49,594 --> 00:14:52,344
It was magic versus with Linux,

351
00:14:53,195 --> 00:14:55,984
I just open up a text file in an editor and read

352
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:56,434
their

353
00:14:56,594 --> 00:14:56,724
source

354
00:14:56,825 --> 00:14:57,825
code. It's much easier

355
00:14:58,434 --> 00:15:02,505
-- and there's mailing lists where they, you
-- don't have to reverse engineer anything

356
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:06,450
and there's mailing lists where they explain why they did it that way and there's

357
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:08,849
IRC channels where you can actually poke them.

358
00:15:08,979 --> 00:15:12,599
And so this comes back to this in the open source world, right?

359
00:15:12,609 --> 00:15:16,760
You can file an issue in github if you found this in a commercial product that, well,

360
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,710
how would you notify them or other people?

361
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:20,309
You can maybe notify the company,

362
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:22,229
-- maybe
-- solar winds. Yo.

363
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,780
Exactly. Right.

364
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:28,229
How do you like if, if I find some random problem in like a Chinese device driver?

365
00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:30,229
Like good luck. No, like, right.

366
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,770
And I think that's one of the secrets to open source and why

367
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:36,330
it has won so heavily is that we don't hide our problems.

368
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,270
And it's not, I'm not saying like, companies intentionally hide their problems,

369
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:41,179
but they do make it very hard.

370
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,909
Like even just to figure out who to talk to to report it to them.

371
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,280
Like uh the CS A, we're looking at a new vendor for something. I

372
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,280
as far as I can tell,

373
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:50,960
they do not have a privacy officer or ad po

374
00:15:50,969 --> 00:15:53,919
or a secured team or anything like everything they say,

375
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:55,750
talks, says talk to customer support.

376
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,570
And I'm like, I hopefully they have a path test like this maybe.

377
00:15:58,599 --> 00:15:59,989
Yeah, I know how that look.

378
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,020
II I want to tie this into the N PM story now about the rat, right?

379
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,309
The remote access Trojan.

380
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:05,909
So this,

381
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:09,159
I think lends some credibility and I know what

382
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:12,140
we're talking about could be misconstrued as Linus's law,

383
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,320
which is with enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.

384
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:18,090
I think that is nonsense. So anyway, this this rat story

385
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,719
from N PM, right? I

386
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:21,909
think this is a good example of what you're talking

387
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:24,890
about in the context of open source because this is where

388
00:16:25,229 --> 00:16:25,969
someone

389
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:28,890
added a backdoor package to N PM

390
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,929
and it looks like it got picked up in about a day,

391
00:16:32,219 --> 00:16:32,609
right?

392
00:16:32,619 --> 00:16:37,919
Like this is where you had security researchers doing this work looking for things

393
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:42,450
and they found it because they were looking for it. And this is a very unique

394
00:16:42,739 --> 00:16:45,219
angle. Open source brings is

395
00:16:45,489 --> 00:16:50,650
there are security people like they are actively hunting for this kind of stuff.

396
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:52,520
Well, it's no, no, it's not security people.

397
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:55,859
It's security companies which is even better because this is, that's

398
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:58,289
bread and butter is saying like this N PM package.

399
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,940
Good, bad, risky, not risky.

400
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,839
And so, like, yeah, they found a package with one index dot Js file a DLL,

401
00:17:05,848 --> 00:17:08,390
an exe and another binary file.

402
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,910
-- It's,
-- it's a clever attack. Like, if you read the story, I'll put it in the show notes.

403
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,130
-- Like it's cool.
-- But also if you look at that,

404
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,390
like, library

405
00:17:18,118 --> 00:17:19,750
it, like, if a sec,

406
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,089
let me rephrase if a security person looks at that

407
00:17:22,098 --> 00:17:25,239
library at all for more than 10 seconds immediately,

408
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,689
they're going to get the heebie Jeebies.

409
00:17:27,118 --> 00:17:27,949
Oh, yeah. Yeah,

410
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:28,420
for sure.

411
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,709
And that's the other thing with this stuff is like, it's so

412
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:34,489
it's easy for somebody to make a claim and publish the claim.

413
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,489
But it's also easy for me to validate

414
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:37,369
it.

415
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,099
And that I think is one of the strengths of open sources,

416
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,390
not that there's a lot of eyeballs looking at the bugs.

417
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,530
It's, but that when somebody sees the bug,

418
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,040
they can actually get it bubbled up real

419
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,239
quick and dealt with real quick because like,

420
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,930
I love it when people make claims about open source.

421
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,010
And I'm like, cool, like, what line of code is it?

422
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:53,380
That's

423
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,329
right. That's right.

424
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:58,410
-- Show
-- me
-- the code and, and the, the other thing that I think is magic here

425
00:17:59,250 --> 00:17:59,910
is like

426
00:18:00,729 --> 00:18:04,250
open source is unique in the context of select this company phylum.

427
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:08,290
-- I've heard of them before, but I couldn't tell you why
-- they're a security firm. Flam

428
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,260
did this work and everyone benefits from the work of this one company.

429
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:17,119
Like that's a, that is a big freaking deal. Yeah. Right.

430
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,719
Like when you're a, a closed source company working on your own products and like,

431
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:21,260
sure Flum

432
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,859
has closed source products. Goodness. So like we do at Anor

433
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:24,819
as well,

434
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:29,000
we can make a change to our product and that will benefit our customers.

435
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,630
But now if we make a change to an open source library, now we benefit

436
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,099
everyone using that stuff in open source.

437
00:18:36,109 --> 00:18:40,359
-- Like it is a hugely powerful, powerful concept, you know,
-- OK,

438
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,599
here's a really interesting thing on their website.

439
00:18:42,609 --> 00:18:44,959
They actually list attacks blocked in the last 24 hours,

440
00:18:44,969 --> 00:18:50,349
33,968 new packages analyzed 1.6 million number of file,

441
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:53,109
scanned 120 malware packages identified

442
00:18:53,462 --> 00:18:53,761
that's

443
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:57,761
like identified. What just it just says malware packages identified.

444
00:18:57,932 --> 00:19:02,712
So well, the thing is right is, I mean, what gets me is stuff like N PM and Piye there,

445
00:19:02,722 --> 00:19:06,631
there is literally no barrier to becoming a contributor and uploading something.

446
00:19:06,962 --> 00:19:08,182
And so

447
00:19:08,452 --> 00:19:11,582
I also wonder how much of this is like people doing their first like, oh,

448
00:19:11,592 --> 00:19:15,011
I meant taking a virus course and I just want to upload and see what happens, right?

449
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:17,621
-- Like that's the thing that always blows my mind when I don't, I
-- don't,

450
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:18,494
I think it's real.

451
00:19:18,504 --> 00:19:20,673
I I suspect this is marketing speak because I

452
00:19:20,683 --> 00:19:23,843
think if they were real honest malware packages,

453
00:19:23,973 --> 00:19:25,754
they make a lot more noise about it. Right.

454
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:29,913
They, they, for example, like this, this blog post they wrote about a rat.

455
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:33,343
But that's kind of what's amazing to me is so, like,

456
00:19:33,354 --> 00:19:35,183
it's like every time where some company is like, oh,

457
00:19:35,193 --> 00:19:38,063
we get 6 million cyber attacks an hour and it's like, yeah, somebody ran in map.

458
00:19:38,073 --> 00:19:41,764
That's, let's see, 1000 ports times 100 posts is like 100,000

459
00:19:41,885 --> 00:19:42,345
scan,

460
00:19:42,786 --> 00:19:43,255
you know.

461
00:19:44,365 --> 00:19:48,446
Exactly. But the, the point I was getting at is there is no barrier to entry.

462
00:19:48,456 --> 00:19:50,286
And yet the problem is this

463
00:19:50,436 --> 00:19:51,975
minimally not terrible.

464
00:19:51,985 --> 00:19:53,505
Like, realistically,

465
00:19:53,515 --> 00:19:58,395
if Attackers really want to upload a malware package to a repo, like to not a repo,

466
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,406
sorry, an ecosystem they absolutely can.

467
00:20:00,446 --> 00:20:04,286
And yet we have a shockingly low rate of this happening.

468
00:20:04,296 --> 00:20:05,985
It's, it's rare enough that it makes the news.

469
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:06,680
I know.

470
00:20:06,689 --> 00:20:09,400
And that's, that's one of the things I think about a lot in,

471
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:12,709
in this context is when you listen to a lot of security people,

472
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,319
it's like the constant, the world is ending.

473
00:20:15,329 --> 00:20:18,290
Cyber Pearl Harbor. Yeah, everything is terrible.

474
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,400
Like, it's a miracle that we're not all dead.

475
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,010
And at the same time it's like

476
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:26,089
I pay my bills online and I just ordered

477
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,770
some stuff from Amazon that's getting delivered later today.

478
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,170
Like,

479
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,109
-- I
-- mean, I do

480
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,170
like, I remember when my credit card got hacked and,

481
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,050
or used to buy some food in Singapore.

482
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,930
And I was, like, trying to figure out where,

483
00:20:36,939 --> 00:20:40,875
and I narrowed it down to one of two places this car wash I use, which if they did,

484
00:20:40,885 --> 00:20:42,474
you think they would have done it years ago?

485
00:20:42,724 --> 00:20:46,135
And I did use a specific online retailer to buy a

486
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:48,395
niche thing that only could be bought at this one,

487
00:20:48,744 --> 00:20:48,885
you know,

488
00:20:49,025 --> 00:20:49,234
probably

489
00:20:49,594 --> 00:20:49,905
store

490
00:20:50,045 --> 00:20:54,994
and they had a really dodgy, like home brew ish looking Ecommerce site. Like it was,

491
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:58,150
it's, you know, and I was just like, oh, whatever, you know,

492
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,829
I want this thing anyways and

493
00:21:00,199 --> 00:21:02,949
because, you know, if you go through like, shop fire Etsy or ebay or something,

494
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:03,880
you know, it's gonna be fine.

495
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:06,920
But it's, you know, when you get to somebody who built this site,

496
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,680
like 20 years ago and it's still running,

497
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:12,969
-- you know? So, I'm pretty sure that's how I got.
-- Definitely PC I compliant.

498
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:13,479
Yeah.

499
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:19,609
No, it's looking at stuff like pytorch and well, on this, this malware rat, like,

500
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:23,689
every time there's a malware rat, like it tends to get in the news

501
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,489
and

502
00:21:24,699 --> 00:21:25,459
let's be real.

503
00:21:25,469 --> 00:21:29,109
If these security companies were finding a lot more of these, they'd be saying. So,

504
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:29,910
like, they

505
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,829
trying to press office and that's,

506
00:21:31,989 --> 00:21:35,954
-- and that's how we, no, it's actually not that bad of a problem.
-- It's, there are,

507
00:21:36,084 --> 00:21:40,714
I think there are instances where it is. I'm sure there are organizations that have

508
00:21:40,935 --> 00:21:42,944
solar winds and stuff. There's Absolutely.

509
00:21:43,055 --> 00:21:44,574
Well, not even just solar winds.

510
00:21:44,584 --> 00:21:45,114
I think the,

511
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,824
the Kaspersky thing we were talking about

512
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:49,224
before we hit record where basically some,

513
00:21:49,234 --> 00:21:50,895
basically, probably a government,

514
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:51,670
like,

515
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,020
attacked Kaspersky in the most ridiculous way possible with

516
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:59,030
like undocumented CPU functionality and iphones and it's,

517
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:03,020
I'll, I'll find the link to the talk and, and it was at CCC.

518
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:04,189
It's nuts.

519
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:06,670
It could be a state level actor or it could

520
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,780
-- be a university group with a bunch of
-- spare time.

521
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:11,819
It's not, it's not at all. It's definitely, anyway, it doesn't matter.

522
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:14,790
I'm not, I'm not going to dwell on this right now. The point is

523
00:22:15,439 --> 00:22:15,939
that

524
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:19,630
we can sit here and say if someone attacks open source,

525
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,959
it's gonna get found right away and some of them will.

526
00:22:21,969 --> 00:22:22,329
But

527
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:22,880
the,

528
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:26,930
you also cannot deny the point that there are almost certainly

529
00:22:26,939 --> 00:22:32,189
like nation state level Attackers that have infiltrated open source projects

530
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:36,989
and have inserted malicious code that none of us will ever detect

531
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,550
because it has been done.

532
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:42,969
So in a manner that is functionally undetectable by a normal person.

533
00:22:43,334 --> 00:22:45,285
Ok. Every off by one bug.

534
00:22:45,515 --> 00:22:48,444
Is it a typo or is it a nation State inserting a back door

535
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:50,964
-- and,
-- and you, you can't, you will never know.

536
00:22:50,974 --> 00:22:52,964
But there, I guarantee that has happened.

537
00:22:52,974 --> 00:22:53,645
However,

538
00:22:53,655 --> 00:22:55,875
here's my point in that and this comes to

539
00:22:55,885 --> 00:22:59,364
the Mossad versus not Mossad argument where there's this,

540
00:22:59,415 --> 00:23:00,864
this paper that was written,

541
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:03,364
it's probably been a decade or more now and I will link to it.

542
00:23:03,574 --> 00:23:06,614
But the author basically talks about dealing with threats

543
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:09,324
as a mossad or not Mossad angle where like

544
00:23:09,619 --> 00:23:11,780
if Massad wants your files,

545
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,430
they will give you like he, what is his comment?

546
00:23:14,439 --> 00:23:17,160
I think he says they will replace your cell phone with a brick of uranium.

547
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,839
Wait for you to die of brain cancer and buy your estate.

548
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:22,949
That is the type of attack you cannot stop.

549
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,500
And that is the kind of attack that

550
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,000
is I guarantee has infiltrated open source projects.

551
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,109
We will never know

552
00:23:28,459 --> 00:23:31,079
they might get caught someday, but they probably won't.

553
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:33,969
Well, but no, no, but here's the thing, even if they did get caught, they'd be like,

554
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:36,280
-- oh, we found an off by one bug in the
-- software, right?

555
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:37,319
But here's the thing,

556
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:40,880
we can't defend against those attacks either, right?

557
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:44,310
This is an attacker with infinite resources and infinite time.

558
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,760
We don't have infinite resources or time on our side.

559
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:51,359
Now we however can defend against,

560
00:23:51,609 --> 00:23:56,989
we'll say the the low sophistication Attackers and the like spray and pre attacks.

561
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,939
And this is like that rat for example, might be one of those.

562
00:23:59,949 --> 00:24:03,439
See, that's, well, I don't know that we can because for example,

563
00:24:03,449 --> 00:24:04,550
if you look at ransomware,

564
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,349
like my understanding is the vast majority of

565
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:08,880
ransomware is using stuff that's months old.

566
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:09,680
No, no, no. In the open

567
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:11,189
-- source world, Kirk.
-- Oh, in the open

568
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:11,910
source world, sorry,

569
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:16,619
-- like
-- attacks against open source. Yes, I agree. Ransomware will never go away.

570
00:24:16,709 --> 00:24:17,819
Like log for Jay.

571
00:24:17,829 --> 00:24:21,439
It's even in the open source world, like it's, it's still floating around.

572
00:24:21,449 --> 00:24:23,020
There's like, what are the stats?

573
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:23,500
Like,

574
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:26,640
I think you said some number of 60% of downloads of log

575
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:30,030
-- for Jay instances are still out of date or whatever it
-- was.

576
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,180
Uh, sonatype had a report a while back.

577
00:24:32,189 --> 00:24:35,459
I don't, I'll see if I can find another copy of it. But anyway,

578
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,310
it's a lot. But here's the thing too with log for

579
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:37,810
shell

580
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,369
long for shell, I don't think is as bad as we thought it was.

581
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:45,489
And I think if it was a lot more of these organizations would have been popped

582
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,119
or you'd see more widespread attacks.

583
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,859
I mean, I think that's the reality of it.

584
00:24:52,209 --> 00:24:55,119
-- I
-- mean, it definitely, if it is exploitable they would have exploited it.

585
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,260
It's kind of a pathology. But it's true. Ee,

586
00:24:57,589 --> 00:24:59,270
exactly. I think,

587
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:03,420
I think anyone running it in a way that could have been exploited probably was.

588
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:03,839
And like, yeah,

589
00:25:03,849 --> 00:25:07,609
a lot of people are downloading vulnerable versions but I think at the same time the,

590
00:25:07,969 --> 00:25:11,430
the reality we see doesn't match the reality of the data.

591
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:14,390
And the reality we see is probably the correct one.

592
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:16,750
Yeah. Well, I mean, I'm still seeing scans for Front Page

593
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:20,630
that hasn't really existed in 1520 years and yet,

594
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,140
you know, so, like, if you're running a vulnerable front page server.

595
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,489
You are for sure. Paul, it's like,

596
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,560
it's like every time like those

597
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,569
that this week's uh what was it? Some flavor of VPN

598
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,500
server has a flaw that you need to patch

599
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:35,390
because it's being like widely exploited Juniper stuff.

600
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,489
It's some brand I've never heard of

601
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:38,469
anyway.

602
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:43,000
More than what it's literally the flavor of the week, you know,

603
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:44,469
and, and here's the thing,

604
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:48,459
like my other example is I remember when I ran an elastic search honey pot for a while,

605
00:25:48,569 --> 00:25:53,020
the ransomware people were like ransoming each other because they just,

606
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:56,599
it was hilarious. But anyway, the point is now all that said,

607
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,800
I don't want us to end on some like, oh, it's really not that bad.

608
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:03,349
Everyone like there are systemic problems in this space.

609
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:07,319
There is a lot of work to do and none of us have a free pass to be like,

610
00:26:07,339 --> 00:26:11,160
-- uh it'll probably be ok
-- and going back to my efficiency thing.

611
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:14,270
This is one of the worst problems I think in open source is that

612
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:18,140
open source is so efficient to use that you can generally

613
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,560
get away with as a company grabbing a bunch of it,

614
00:26:20,569 --> 00:26:22,869
shoving it in your light bulb to make the light bulb work

615
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,619
-- and then walking away from it and never supporting
-- it and never touching it again

616
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:27,729
-- for sure
-- because I'm

617
00:26:27,989 --> 00:26:32,020
sure my Hugh light bulbs have like really not had an OS update in since I bought them.

618
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:33,380
-- Uh No,
-- they probably do.

619
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:33,709
Like,

620
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:37,420
I actually keep an eye on this from time to time because I check my bulbs and they,

621
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,180
every couple of months

622
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:42,189
there's an update to my Hugh light bulbs.

623
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,270
I think the app will tell you for

624
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:45,339
updated.

625
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,050
-- It's
-- on automatic updates. Everything is

626
00:26:47,349 --> 00:26:47,750
in the

627
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:48,800
middle of the night.

628
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:52,650
Uh, I have no idea what these version numbers mean.

629
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:57,670
Oh, wow. The version numbers across my light bulbs are all over the place.

630
00:26:57,729 --> 00:27:00,920
So the challenge is people turn their lights off. Sometimes

631
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:04,060
I know I'm literally seeing that like the whole like

632
00:27:05,109 --> 00:27:05,939
this is why

633
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,800
this is why like a bunch of my basically,

634
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:13,359
once a year I turn on all of my hue light bulbs and then I manually

635
00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:17,619
update all the firmware for the things that are off like when they normally update.

636
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,089
-- But anyway, it doesn't matter. It's
-- actually not too bad. A couple of them.

637
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,609
Uh There's a couple of lights in here that probably no,

638
00:27:23,619 --> 00:27:25,439
the kitchen light's been turned on or is that?

639
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,920
Oh, is that the anyway, is it?

640
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:27,290
We

641
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:27,650
don't need

642
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,339
to do this,

643
00:27:28,709 --> 00:27:28,729
we

644
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,239
need to do.

645
00:27:29,489 --> 00:27:29,530
It's

646
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,699
not as bad as I thought.

647
00:27:30,819 --> 00:27:34,709
Well, but he was a premium brand and like I'm sure those cheaper brands are not so

648
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:35,319
premium,

649
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:37,800
I think. Anyway.

650
00:27:37,969 --> 00:27:41,260
Well, and this goes to some of the things we've been looking at is like

651
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,780
part of the challenge is

652
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,449
ok, perfect.

653
00:27:43,459 --> 00:27:45,979
It's like having emergency generator capacity why

654
00:27:45,989 --> 00:27:48,150
would I have emergency generator capacity as

655
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,199
a power provider when I could like have generator capacity that I can sell?

656
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:55,750
Like, why would I have a capacity that I'm not selling?

657
00:27:55,989 --> 00:27:56,569
And so,

658
00:27:56,579 --> 00:27:59,449
but it goes to this like these efficiency arguments of open source

659
00:27:59,459 --> 00:28:02,170
works so well and it's so good and it's so easy.

660
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:05,640
Why would I not use it? Especially when I don't have to give back or contribute.

661
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:09,689
And I, I don't know if there's a solution to these, that these challenges,

662
00:28:10,609 --> 00:28:10,880
you know,

663
00:28:11,109 --> 00:28:14,319
-- some of
-- them, a lot of them don't have, a lot of them don't have solutions.

664
00:28:14,329 --> 00:28:14,770
And look,

665
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,420
here's what it comes down to and this is

666
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:19,459
exactly where the pie torch stuff lands and I'll,

667
00:28:19,469 --> 00:28:20,979
I'll, I'll just end it on this note.

668
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,180
All of this,

669
00:28:22,189 --> 00:28:25,540
everything we've talked about fundamentally boils down to a risk decision.

670
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,790
Your comment about

671
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:28,609
I own a generator.

672
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,819
Shouldn't I be running it and selling the excess capacity? For example?

673
00:28:33,089 --> 00:28:35,689
Well, that's a risk decision. Right? If I

674
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,339
think I'm going to need power,

675
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:42,979
then I have to decide like is the cost of not running for

676
00:28:42,989 --> 00:28:47,829
a period of time versus the cost of buying and maintaining a generator?

677
00:28:48,239 --> 00:28:48,550
Like,

678
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:53,540
let's do the math and figure out like is my downtime worth more than the generator.

679
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,819
Maybe it is. Maybe it is. It depends

680
00:28:55,949 --> 00:28:58,239
on a more personal level. I live here in Alberta. Right?

681
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:01,819
And we had last week that emergency alert to,

682
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,890
like, turn off your stove and stuff because, right,

683
00:29:04,989 --> 00:29:07,449
because it was minus a billion degrees.

684
00:29:07,459 --> 00:29:10,859
-- Yeah.
-- Actually the one place hit minus 50.3 or something,

685
00:29:11,369 --> 00:29:14,089
it was only like, minus 40 here plus windshield. But anyway,

686
00:29:14,829 --> 00:29:17,040
but the point that's kind of normal for this area.

687
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:21,050
In fact, everyone minus 40 is where Celsius and Fahrenheit cross.

688
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,800
So you can just say minus 40

689
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,839
it doesn't matter which scale you use.

690
00:29:24,849 --> 00:29:28,560
-- Alberta
-- was using just over 12 gigawatts of power

691
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,000
and you know what the buffer was?

692
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:33,800
10 megawatts, that's the only excess capacity they have.

693
00:29:34,979 --> 00:29:38,939
Like, that's not a lot. That's 10, 1 megawatt generators.

694
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:39,750
Hey, they

695
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:41,311
above the line. All right

696
00:29:42,161 --> 00:29:43,041
-- above the line.
-- It's

697
00:29:43,701 --> 00:29:44,220
the alert

698
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,401
and power usage dropped 100 and 50 megawatts in five minutes.

699
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:51,850
I'm impressed. I think in America it would have gone up after such an alert.

700
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,711
I was part of the problem.

701
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,470
I had my car plugged in with the block heater that consumes about a kilowatt.

702
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:56,470
Wow, that's a lot.

703
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,750
And now I was like, you know,

704
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,890
that is stupid because I only need to heat it for an hour or two before I use the car.

705
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,240
So I have one of those little, you know,

706
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:06,110
like timer plug things with a 15 minute increment thing, ma jiggers.

707
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:08,191
And so, yeah, I just have it, it's set. Now,

708
00:30:08,442 --> 00:30:10,982
I do plug it in to run between six and eight in the morning,

709
00:30:11,192 --> 00:30:13,411
which is not, I mean, the power usage time

710
00:30:13,732 --> 00:30:15,241
and you'll save a ton of money too. So,

711
00:30:16,702 --> 00:30:16,991
anyway,

712
00:30:17,302 --> 00:30:17,982
anyway,

713
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:22,921
risk, it's all about risk. And this is the Pie Torch project

714
00:30:23,141 --> 00:30:27,202
has to make a risk decision about how much effort are we going to put into?

715
00:30:27,212 --> 00:30:31,942
I'll put security and air quotes versus just like running a project.

716
00:30:31,952 --> 00:30:33,761
And the other problem with this risk thing though is

717
00:30:33,771 --> 00:30:36,241
it assumes that people know that they even have risk,

718
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:36,842
let alone

719
00:30:37,032 --> 00:30:38,973
even remotely, have quantified it.

720
00:30:39,363 --> 00:30:43,213
Uh, everyone knows they have risk. Most people don't know what to do with it.

721
00:30:43,223 --> 00:30:45,883
And this is true of security people, security people,

722
00:30:46,072 --> 00:30:49,932
I think are some of the worst of all of making up crap.

723
00:30:50,302 --> 00:30:51,833
-- That isn't real
-- true.

724
00:30:51,843 --> 00:30:55,062
And there's also a lot of like, real risks that they ignore and,

725
00:30:55,072 --> 00:30:56,172
or don't even think about,

726
00:30:56,322 --> 00:30:58,912
like, when I talk to people about off fender backups and I'm like,

727
00:30:58,922 --> 00:30:59,993
what if your account gets deleted?

728
00:31:00,003 --> 00:31:00,812
They're like, oh,

729
00:31:01,162 --> 00:31:03,532
-- yeah, it
-- an unknown risk.

730
00:31:03,542 --> 00:31:06,524
I mean, I need to think about that one because it might not matter.

731
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,394
No, I don't mean unknown, unknown, but I mean,

732
00:31:08,404 --> 00:31:12,323
I'm talking about common risk that that person specifically is ignoring.

733
00:31:12,494 --> 00:31:13,514
Oh, yeah. No, that's fine.

734
00:31:13,524 --> 00:31:16,963
-- That's called accepting the risk and if you accept the risk,
-- great.

735
00:31:17,154 --> 00:31:21,494
-- Well, no, but do they even know about it? Uh,
-- do they know they're accepting the risk?

736
00:31:21,543 --> 00:31:24,923
-- Some people might, some people might not.
-- I was going through a backup system.

737
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:27,524
Then I remembered, oh, we have this other org that I set up.

738
00:31:27,534 --> 00:31:30,203
I don't have backups enabled for it. Oops. And I went in and did that

739
00:31:30,543 --> 00:31:33,244
well, but here's the other part of that, let's say you don't have backups,

740
00:31:33,254 --> 00:31:34,104
let's say you're the, it,

741
00:31:34,324 --> 00:31:37,915
for a company, everything crashes, company goes out of business.

742
00:31:37,925 --> 00:31:40,944
Whose problem is that really, you're just going to go get a new job.

743
00:31:40,954 --> 00:31:45,334
Like the owner of the company is the one who actually

744
00:31:45,645 --> 00:31:49,755
outsourced the risk to an employee who didn't do their job.

745
00:31:49,765 --> 00:31:52,755
And so that's the funny thing is like, when you talk about risk in that context,

746
00:31:52,765 --> 00:31:54,505
you think, oh, it's the, it person's risk.

747
00:31:54,515 --> 00:31:56,155
No, it's the owner's risk.

748
00:31:56,344 --> 00:31:59,755
They outsourced it to the, it person who then dropped it on the floor.

749
00:31:59,765 --> 00:32:02,675
And that's what makes these discussions so difficult and weird.

750
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:06,449
And this is where something like Pie Torch is in a

751
00:32:06,459 --> 00:32:09,319
situation just like that where the vast majority of these people,

752
00:32:09,329 --> 00:32:10,239
it's not their problem.

753
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:13,640
-- Pytorch is the Kubernetes of a
-- I, uh, that, that's fair.

754
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,760
Like, it's just a foundational building block now.

755
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,000
No, I know,

756
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,430
-- I know that's irrelevant to my point.
-- But

757
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:23,810
what gets me is nobody's gonna even remotely help them out or, you know,

758
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:24,880
give them more than a dollar.

759
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:27,000
Well, we're gonna find out, aren't we? So,

760
00:32:27,449 --> 00:32:31,469
and, and here's the thing, even if no one helps him out, will it matter? It'll be fine.

761
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:33,560
Maybe it won't. I think my guess is it'll be fine.

762
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,750
They'll have some incidents, they'll deal with the incidents and then

763
00:32:36,949 --> 00:32:40,349
that's just the way it is. It's like, it's like an episode of Star Trek. Right.

764
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:44,229
Everything gets crazy for a little while and then it just goes back to normal,

765
00:32:44,239 --> 00:32:45,630
-- then
-- they reverse the polarity.

766
00:32:45,939 --> 00:32:46,189
Yeah.

767
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:49,550
And then, like, uh, we don't have to change anything, anybody,

768
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,930
no need to do any sort of post mortem on what just happened.

769
00:32:53,316 --> 00:32:56,776
Just go back to doing everything the way we were doing it before.

770
00:32:56,806 --> 00:32:58,566
You know what my favorite thing is, is how they like,

771
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:00,965
took away Jordy's visor and like they made commander

772
00:33:00,975 --> 00:33:03,296
data more human to explain the actor's aging.

773
00:33:03,326 --> 00:33:09,656
No data. No, no, they can explain that data was programmed by doctor soon to age

774
00:33:09,826 --> 00:33:16,416
-- naturally as part of his like, just experience.
-- Yes, that's Wink Wink.

775
00:33:16,426 --> 00:33:19,056
Even though he would live for hundreds and hundreds of years

776
00:33:19,182 --> 00:33:23,682
and Jordy lost the visor because Levar Burton wasn't going to come back

777
00:33:23,692 --> 00:33:26,641
if they made him wear it again because he hated that thing.

778
00:33:27,052 --> 00:33:29,761
That's why Jordy didn't need a visor anymore.

779
00:33:29,972 --> 00:33:31,251
But anyway, anyway,

780
00:33:31,421 --> 00:33:33,692
-- but they made him wear those wonky contacts.
-- It's,

781
00:33:33,852 --> 00:33:36,962
it must have been better than the visor because he came back.

782
00:33:37,491 --> 00:33:42,082
Well, it's funny to me because one of the original, hang on a sec.

783
00:33:42,092 --> 00:33:45,978
Um because one of the original core like rules from Gene

784
00:33:45,988 --> 00:33:48,667
Roddenberry was you have to be able to see aliens eyes.

785
00:33:48,677 --> 00:33:50,848
You can put as much junk on them as you want,

786
00:33:51,137 --> 00:33:54,718
but actors emote through their eyes a lot. And so you have to be able to see their eyes.

787
00:33:54,728 --> 00:33:57,128
So in the original Star Trek, no matter what,

788
00:33:57,208 --> 00:33:59,108
you could always see the alien's eyes and

789
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:03,297
mostly true in the later, Star Treks and Jordi was like the one exception to the rule.

790
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,697
But also the uh, I want to say the brain, you know,

791
00:34:05,708 --> 00:34:09,068
-- the way they wear those goofy helmets,
-- like the, the brain wear helmets.

792
00:34:09,498 --> 00:34:13,714
-- I mean, there were a handful of characters with helmets during the show,
-- right.

793
00:34:13,724 --> 00:34:16,072
But, I mean, even the brain took their helmets off once in a while.

794
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:19,813
-- Poor Jordie was
-- like, I don't think the Breen ever took their helmets off.

795
00:34:19,822 --> 00:34:21,694
Uh, they knocked one out, remember?

796
00:34:22,033 --> 00:34:24,493
And they, like, hid in its uniform.

797
00:34:24,503 --> 00:34:28,454
-- But
-- I don't think we know what a Breen looks like under its uniform.

798
00:34:28,464 --> 00:34:29,023
Well, I mean,

799
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:31,893
they've probably must because they've killed them and knocked them out and stuff.

800
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:35,322
I don't think we've ever seen under a Brien's helmet that I know of anyway.

801
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:36,918
All right, here's, here is a,

802
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:39,639
to do for the audience because we need to end this episode.

803
00:34:39,649 --> 00:34:41,050
Send us a picture of a Breen.

804
00:34:41,208 --> 00:34:45,040
If, if there is information about what a Breen looks like under their helmet,

805
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:48,800
let us know because, and, and if you don't know what we're talking about like,

806
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:50,260
go watch more Star Trek.

807
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:52,478
All right. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you all for listening.
