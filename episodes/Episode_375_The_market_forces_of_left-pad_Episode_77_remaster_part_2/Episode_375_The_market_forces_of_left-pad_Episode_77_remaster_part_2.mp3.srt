Hi, Josh, again,

1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:07,630
this is part two of the left pad discussion that obviously go back to last week and,

2
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:09,550
and start there if you land here.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,899
But we kind of spend a lot of this second

4
00:00:12,909 --> 00:00:15,909
half of the discussion talking about the market forces around

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,409
the supply chain and left pad and, and it's,

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,090
it's shocking how much still still matters today.

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,110
So thanks for listening.

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:30,920
Every single person writing a Ruby gem app that uses like these common things.

9
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:34,029
They're gonna spend tens or hundreds of hours of engineering

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,009
and ongoing maintenance and backing it up and blah,

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:36,580
blah, blah, blah, blah.

12
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,810
And the answer is no, clearly we're not right.

13
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:41,220
You know, because that's what's happened. The market has spoken.

14
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,830
-- Uh
-- and, and maybe it has, I, I feel like I wish we could fix this but you might be right.

15
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:47,650
Maybe,

16
00:00:47,849 --> 00:00:51,389
-- maybe it just never will get bad enough.
-- I don't know that we need to fix this.

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,849
It's like houses, burning down,

18
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:57,049
houses, burn down and apparently over Christmas that it's about twice as likely

19
00:00:57,409 --> 00:00:59,430
for houses in North America to burn down, I guess.

20
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:03,029
-- Is that like Christmas lights, I assume? Or I I
-- don't know.

21
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:03,569
Well,

22
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,080
you would think now with led lights it would

23
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:06,800
be very unlikely because they're so low voltage.

24
00:01:06,809 --> 00:01:07,870
But I'm guessing it's more like

25
00:01:08,029 --> 00:01:11,000
people having fires and they haven't cleaned their chimneys in forever.

26
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,849
Or people having candles.

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,190
Right. Like those big red,

28
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,010
you know, Christmas candles that people seem to like whatever. It's true.

29
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:21,050
The point is houses burn down and it really sucks when a house burns down,

30
00:01:21,419 --> 00:01:23,269
especially when it's minus 40 outside.

31
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,290
But the reality is houses burn down so rarely now that it's kind of like, well,

32
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:28,940
you know what?

33
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:29,870
Ok,

34
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,470
like we, we, we're not going to build like in North America,

35
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,989
we build the majority of our, you know, houses out of wood, right?

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,510
Two by four plywood construction

37
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,910
and, you know, once they get going, they burn

38
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,660
right. There's condos locally, four story condos, several 100 units

39
00:01:46,809 --> 00:01:48,709
and they're just all plywood and two by four

40
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,430
with like, you know, cinder block, uh, cinderblock staircases for the fire escape.

41
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,949
Ok. So you are right.

42
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:56,660
But

43
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:01,349
we didn't get to the point where Fear House is burned down by luck. Right.

44
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,389
Oh, true. No building codes and you know,

45
00:02:04,606 --> 00:02:06,475
lots of operational changes. Like

46
00:02:06,655 --> 00:02:09,526
people don't heat their houses by, uh, well,

47
00:02:09,535 --> 00:02:12,205
I was going to say people don't heat their houses with, you know, wood fires,

48
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:12,626
for example.

49
00:02:12,636 --> 00:02:14,865
Although my neighbor right next to me does, you know,

50
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:17,735
the majority of us have like natural gas furnaces now, which again,

51
00:02:17,746 --> 00:02:21,205
generally are quite safe and tend not to catch fire or burn the house down.

52
00:02:21,406 --> 00:02:24,705
So, yeah. No, we definitely didn't get here by just magic.

53
00:02:24,716 --> 00:02:26,746
You know, we got here through a lot. Well, it's like the whole area

54
00:02:27,292 --> 00:02:31,412
disaster thing last year, there weren't any and we got there through like,

55
00:02:31,421 --> 00:02:33,582
decades of continuous improvement,

56
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:39,111
like decades of, of technology, of operational changes, you know, things like, oh,

57
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:43,261
maybe we should not make pilots fly for 18 hours straight because when they do,

58
00:02:43,272 --> 00:02:44,712
they tend to get sleepy and you know,

59
00:02:45,022 --> 00:02:49,162
what is it controlled? Descent into terrain, right? They, they fly into things is

60
00:02:49,361 --> 00:02:52,582
if you look at like the N PM and Rube Jams and all these things,

61
00:02:53,179 --> 00:02:55,800
the number of times we have really bad massive

62
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:58,520
problems that result in massive pain for people.

63
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,000
It's really rare,

64
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,589
like it's so rare that when we look at the N PM thing,

65
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,130
there's essentially that one instant.

66
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:07,160
Well, there's two instances. The, the second instance being is that

67
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:10,110
N PM had some sort of weird technical glitch

68
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:12,139
and a bunch of packages weren't available for a while

69
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,910
and something went wrong. Some people tried to re register the packages.

70
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,949
And so basically there's two examples for N PM in a span of like two or three years.

71
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,520
-- But
-- there's an example every week we have a

72
00:03:22,529 --> 00:03:25,270
podcast that we never run out of content for,

73
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:28,270
I mean, Equifax, the Intel bug N PM.

74
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:29,710
There's a million things going

75
00:03:29,945 --> 00:03:31,975
on. They're just unrelated enough.

76
00:03:32,235 --> 00:03:32,475
Well,

77
00:03:32,485 --> 00:03:35,565
but when you consider how many different technologies

78
00:03:35,574 --> 00:03:37,634
and hardware solutions and things we're talking about,

79
00:03:37,645 --> 00:03:40,925
you know, it's just like the real world, look at how many microwaves fail.

80
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:42,975
Right. And, and let's think about airplanes.

81
00:03:42,985 --> 00:03:45,994
There are thousands of ways an airplane can fail, right?

82
00:03:46,065 --> 00:03:50,955
But the problem is the end result of an airplane crash is a catastrophic event.

83
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,074
People can relate to

84
00:03:52,235 --> 00:03:56,494
the end result of a house burning down is a catastrophic event. People can relate to.

85
00:03:56,729 --> 00:04:00,149
The problem with software is the intel bug

86
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:03,970
is maybe catastrophic, maybe not. It depends how you want to talk about it.

87
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:04,830
But fundamentally,

88
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,350
the result of that problem is different than the result

89
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,570
of Equifax is different than the result of the node.

90
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,570
And I think the fact that we have this lack of consistency as

91
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,690
kind of our outcomes is what makes it difficult for people to understand

92
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,859
that these are related problems, but they are not the same problem.

93
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,130
Part of it is, it reminds me of heartbleed.

94
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,049
So when the openness cell, heartbleed bug came out,

95
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,049
normally these things don't make the national news, however,

96
00:04:31,059 --> 00:04:34,109
it did in Canada because revenue Canada had to shut down

97
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:38,209
their website for taking tax returns, which

98
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,059
it was a week before the deadline for taxes.

99
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,079
And so the final week of tax filing

100
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,339
electronically

101
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:48,119
didn't work like they turned it off.

102
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,880
And so obviously that made the national news and they

103
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,700
had to extend the filing deadline and it was a,

104
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:52,459
you know, like

105
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:56,559
I remember my mom asking me about this because she heard about it on the news, right.

106
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,920
Like the intel meltdown thing as far as I know, never made the news,

107
00:04:59,929 --> 00:05:02,630
like the mainstream media, you know, like cnn.com.

108
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:07,709
It, it made the online news for sure. But like, was it on TV? I don't really think so.

109
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,559
I don't watch TV, but it was in the local newspaper for what it's worth

110
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:16,239
and it did get a little blurb in, in, I think the business section for me.

111
00:05:16,429 --> 00:05:17,100
Ok.

112
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,359
-- Yeah, normal people don't read that. Probably
-- not.

113
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,579
I, I did have one normal person. I know

114
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:25,739
when they, they, I, I talked to them and they're like, so how's it going?

115
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,279
I'm like, I've had better weeks. They said, oh, this is a chip thing, right?

116
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,980
I said, wow. You know what that is? I'm impressed.

117
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,799
Well, no, they don't know what it is, they've heard about

118
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:35,190
it.

119
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,859
And that's what I was gonna say is the

120
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:40,299
next problem is for most of these technical failures.

121
00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:42,339
Ok. Plane crashing and burning. Yeah, that's easy

122
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,790
to understand. House burning down.

123
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:46,730
Easy to understand the specter and meltdown bug.

124
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:49,309
Not so easy to understand, like, true or false.

125
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,500
Do you have to patch the underlying hardware host?

126
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:54,459
-- True?
-- You like, always have to patch the underlying host.

127
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,890
-- It doesn't matter what CPU you're running, you
-- just cert says I need a new processor.

128
00:05:58,910 --> 00:05:59,100
Yeah.

129
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:03,779
If it's, if it's like an X 86 processor, you, you almost guaranteed have to patch.

130
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,239
Now,

131
00:06:04,429 --> 00:06:05,140
here's a question,

132
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,019
virtual machines

133
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:11,380
running on top of a patch. Toast. Do you need to patch the virtual machines?

134
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:15,799
But I know the answer to that because it's yes, but um many people probably don't.

135
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:18,220
Well, the answer is a little more subtle than that. It's

136
00:06:18,489 --> 00:06:21,670
yes for virtual machine to other virtual machine attacks, but no,

137
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:23,440
for virtual machine to host attacks

138
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,579
if the host is patched.

139
00:06:25,739 --> 00:06:27,339
Right. And so all of a sudden, like

140
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:32,609
we've gone from simple to, oh, this is actually getting really messy really fast.

141
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,500
And then what's the outcome of this bug? Well, you can steal some data

142
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,079
in theory, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Right. It's not like

143
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:43,470
-- it catches fire or it just fails. It's like no,
-- it's nothing explodes.

144
00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:45,429
Exactly. Not like the movies.

145
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,089
And, you know, that's the thing, like

146
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:52,059
most of these security flaws even trying to explain it,

147
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,470
you know, it becomes

148
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,260
very complex very rapidly. And that was one thing I noticed about the meltdown.

149
00:06:57,269 --> 00:07:00,309
Inspector coverage is everybody on Twitter complaining incessantly about

150
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,630
how the journalists were getting technical deet tells wrong.

151
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,019
It's like, of course, they are like,

152
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:07,609
ask somebody to explain how to change a wheel on a car and

153
00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:09,679
nine times out of 10 myself included,

154
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,399
I get it wrong because I always forget that you crack the nuts first

155
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,869
and then put the thing on the jack and then loosen the nuts.

156
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,250
Right.

157
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:19,390
My thinking is always jack the car up, take the, take the nuts off, take the wheel off,

158
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,149
swap it right.

159
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,559
Spin that wheel. Right.

160
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,700
I have done that so many times where I jack the car up and

161
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:27,790
then I go to take the wheel off and the wheel just spins and,

162
00:07:27,799 --> 00:07:29,750
like, put the car back down.

163
00:07:29,809 --> 00:07:32,350
Then I listen nuts. Then I put the car back up.

164
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:33,859
I, I done it.

165
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:34,529
Exactly.

166
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:38,230
And that's a relatively simple thing that you can explain to a four year old.

167
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,230
-- You
-- think so,

168
00:07:39,429 --> 00:07:41,429
you know, but like specter and meltdown

169
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:41,869
or,

170
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:45,339
or heart bleed or poodle like a downgrade attack,

171
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,350
that's not really a downgrade problem.

172
00:07:47,359 --> 00:07:47,570
If

173
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,630
you know, the server has like certificate ordering enabled, blah, blah.

174
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,529
You know what I mean? Like it just all of a sudden, like people start

175
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,500
and I'm talking about like technical people that their

176
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,309
eyes just glaze over and they give up.

177
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,799
Right. My, my take on the specter and meltdown is really easy

178
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:03,989
if your vendor has provided patches,

179
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,440
you install them.

180
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:08,019
And as far as microcode goes, you,

181
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,690
we're gonna have to wait for proper good microcode updates.

182
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,880
And as soon as they come out,

183
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:16,220
you install them and it literally boils down to like my phone strategy,

184
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,739
which is about once or twice a week.

185
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,929
I just run the updater

186
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,359
and update everything

187
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,040
because what else am I gonna do?

188
00:08:22,049 --> 00:08:26,850
You know what else this reminds me of is I remember when stack clash came out,

189
00:08:26,859 --> 00:08:29,010
that one was, it's been, it's been a while.

190
00:08:29,019 --> 00:08:30,600
That was the one where the stack and the heap

191
00:08:30,609 --> 00:08:33,719
you could get them to overlap and then you could essentially

192
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,119
overwrite data.

193
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,690
Oh, yeah, that was sorry.

194
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,520
I spent like three months working on that one and I've already spaced.

195
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,479
I know it's been, it's been a while. I, I remember that one

196
00:08:43,619 --> 00:08:44,200
and

197
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:48,219
there were a lot of really smart people, I was talking to that, that they, they were,

198
00:08:48,229 --> 00:08:49,030
they were confused.

199
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:51,820
And I remember one person was talking about how you can become

200
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,260
rute with this and you could because of an attack against,

201
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,419
what was it pseudo I think.

202
00:08:56,599 --> 00:09:00,619
But I said, explain to me how you can become route if we, if we,

203
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,820
if you don't have pseudo on the machine because the

204
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,799
one of the machines in question didn't have pseudo.

205
00:09:05,099 --> 00:09:07,940
And he's telling me about how you can use this to override kernel memory.

206
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,419
And I'm like,

207
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:09,840
right,

208
00:09:09,979 --> 00:09:11,320
that's not how this works.

209
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:14,950
And then I spent like an hour explaining the problem, but like that's the thing,

210
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,119
right?

211
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,609
-- This stuff is so hard.
-- Well, that's the thing.

212
00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:21,700
Like, I mean, the stack clash stuff was at least it wasn't hardware. Thank goodness.

213
00:09:21,809 --> 00:09:25,400
And I remember, you know, Wallace found it did a ton of good research they were like,

214
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:26,750
oh, we think we found a good solution.

215
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,359
One megabyte G

216
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,039
pages.

217
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:31,849
And then Florian was like, nope, if we're gonna do the guard page route,

218
00:09:31,859 --> 00:09:33,760
we have to go with about 3.5 gigabytes.

219
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,650
And that's not really gonna work on 32 bit

220
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:37,940
systems because you can basically have three threats,

221
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:38,299
whatever.

222
00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:41,200
It's not like anything's running 32 bit systems anymore.

223
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,500
Not like billions of devices

224
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:44,289
connected to.

225
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,320
Exactly.

226
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,909
So, and then, you know, so the whole guard page thing was like, whoops,

227
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,409
that's really not gonna work.

228
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:51,330
And, you know, and then it was like, ok, well,

229
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:55,260
and, and then it got worse because it was like, OK, well, now we have to fix the kernel,

230
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:55,700
OK?

231
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,710
And we have to fix

232
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:57,369
gipsy

233
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,479
and we have to fix GCC.

234
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,359
So all of a sudden we've gone from like, oh, let's just increase guard size to,

235
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:06,869
let's start monkey around with fundamental

236
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,580
memory primitives and how code compiles.

237
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:12,679
-- Oh, and don't break anything while you're at it
-- and, and

238
00:10:12,869 --> 00:10:13,320
right,

239
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,789
and nothing changed

240
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:18,659
and don't impact performance if you can while you're at it, that,

241
00:10:18,669 --> 00:10:19,719
that doesn't matter anymore.

242
00:10:19,729 --> 00:10:20,520
I think actually

243
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,679
a really funny tweet yesterday that it was someone

244
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,780
said you knew this was a security problem when

245
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:27,640
someone posted a patch that impacted performance and Linus

246
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,530
didn't yell at them and call them an idiot.

247
00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:32,010
That's

248
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:33,840
true. That's very true.

249
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:35,669
So,

250
00:10:35,849 --> 00:10:36,919
and you know, and, and,

251
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:40,549
and it's funny to hear people complaining about the embargo for the for this uh

252
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,900
spectrum meltdown thing because it's like, no, this was like

253
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:47,929
crazy amounts of engineering for like seven months

254
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,419
and

255
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:51,900
like, it's still not done, right? Like

256
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:55,479
there are, what is it, there's specter patches in the upstream Linux kernel.

257
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,900
And I don't know at the time of the release of this podcast,

258
00:10:57,909 --> 00:11:00,349
whether or not the meltdown patches will have landed in the,

259
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,520
in the Linux kernel tree.

260
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,330
I don't think they're there quite yet.

261
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,780
Like they have some good ideas of what they're gonna do,

262
00:11:06,789 --> 00:11:08,619
but they haven't actually done it yet.

263
00:11:08,739 --> 00:11:10,099
-- Wait,
-- the meltdown patches.

264
00:11:10,109 --> 00:11:13,869
-- I thought they already patched meltdown in the upstream kernel
-- or was it spect?

265
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,200
Oh, no, no, no. Sorry. I got to reverse. Yeah. Meltdown got patched.

266
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,969
-- It's specter that didn't get patched. Sorry. Yeah.
-- See, I, I know.

267
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:19,929
Seriously, man, I,

268
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,049
I've been like living and breathing this for two months and my brain is just,

269
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:25,500
I know I can't keep it straight anymore anyways point

270
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,820
being is like like the Linux kernel upstream still hasn't

271
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:30,750
completely finished dealing with this.

272
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,349
We're still,

273
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,440
there's still going to be micro code updates

274
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,039
that are going to take

275
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,400
a while

276
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,880
uh conservatively to get it this fully, right?

277
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:43,140
Like we have micro code updates right now that

278
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,320
are causing problems, right?

279
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,500
If you Google it, there's like a lot of people that, you know,

280
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,799
install these microcode updates and they're really not happy about what happened

281
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:53,919
again because this is like a hideously complex thing to fix.

282
00:11:54,609 --> 00:11:55,280
And so,

283
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,219
you know, we really needed the embargo on this one because

284
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,510
like you said, and I think the last podcast, you know, if,

285
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,950
if you're trying to do like really complicated

286
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,049
engineering with a whole pile of people screaming,

287
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:07,880
hurry up at you,

288
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,409
you're going to make decisions that are going to turn out to be not so,

289
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,109
so great.

290
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:14,719
No, I, I totally agree.

291
00:12:14,729 --> 00:12:19,289
And so all right, so, but let's stop ranting about the problems because

292
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,840
I, I totally get that. But

293
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,549
so, so let's come back to the point,

294
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,869
are things so bad

295
00:12:25,989 --> 00:12:30,640
or rather will things ever get bad enough that we will actually ever fix anything?

296
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,869
Well, it's, we are fixing things in the sense of I looking at this.

297
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,619
We've traded prom. So for example, we we now have

298
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,229
developers can trivially

299
00:12:43,369 --> 00:12:46,070
build an application that pulls in a bunch of dependencies and it

300
00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:47,960
basically always works

301
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:50,380
like I don't know if people remember 20 years ago,

302
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:52,840
but like what Java's solution was

303
00:12:53,099 --> 00:12:53,900
was

304
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,679
while you in bed.

305
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:02,679
So like I've literally seen Java apps with 14 layers of embedded jars, wars and ears.

306
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:05,580
-- And
-- it's great when you have the same jar

307
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,760
in five other jars because they all depend on it

308
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,849
at multiple depths of the chain and everything,

309
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:12,859
you know. So that,

310
00:13:12,969 --> 00:13:14,549
I mean, well, and back then you got to remember,

311
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:16,190
we didn't have as much bandwidth or servers.

312
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,229
So like the solution was OK.

313
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:20,679
You know, essentially statically compile this pile of stuff,

314
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:25,059
you know, and things like Maven didn't exist for those of you thinking just

315
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:25,559
Maven.

316
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:27,599
-- Right.
-- Yeah, exactly.

317
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,789
And so on the one hand,

318
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,619
we've created a pile of security problems, but on the other hand,

319
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:37,710
we've actually solved a huge pile of real world problems where,

320
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,559
you know, that we're preventing developers from getting their jobs done

321
00:13:40,729 --> 00:13:42,559
and now developers can get their job done,

322
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:45,099
they can churn out code that works and does useful things

323
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,770
way faster.

324
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:50,739
And you know what I'll take that I will take risk, you know,

325
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,059
pretty much any business will take, ok?

326
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,650
You can give me a working product with risk or alternatively, no risk,

327
00:13:56,659 --> 00:13:58,460
no working product for six months.

328
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,429
Well, clearly, you know, if we can ship today, we can start selling today.

329
00:14:02,489 --> 00:14:05,570
-- So that's what we're going to do.
-- I, I agree with that 100%.

330
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,539
And here's the beauty too is, is

331
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:12,289
on the one hand, I hate this centralization of kind of, of power and failure.

332
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,580
But on the other hand, it means we only have to fix it in one spot.

333
00:14:16,099 --> 00:14:18,599
That is a reasonable observation.

334
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:22,000
Like what if N PM changes the client so that it locally,

335
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,960
it has a switch to locally cash stuff in a really intelligent way.

336
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:26,409
I know

337
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,760
that fix anything.

338
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:29,590
I mean,

339
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,479
well, you'd at least have a local copy when N pm.org forgets to renew their DNS,

340
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,760
like straight up, that'll happen someday.

341
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:39,880
If that happens, there's gonna be way bigger problems going on

342
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:40,460
than

343
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,359
cashing files locally.

344
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:47,799
They've only paid for the registration out to 2018 July.

345
00:14:47,989 --> 00:14:48,479
Like I,

346
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:50,570
I have a bunch of important domains that are

347
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,080
like registered out 10 years that I renew yearly.

348
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:57,169
With the idea being that if I forget to renew it for like five years, I, I have some,

349
00:14:57,179 --> 00:14:57,650
you know,

350
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:01,900
-- some time to make sure I get it
-- right. I think I have a domain I need to renew.

351
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:03,890
Actually, I should look into that.

352
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,150
I,

353
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,010
well, it's a dot Name

354
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,109
and, and I want to move it, but it's,

355
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:11,719
it's really painful actually to deal with dot Names because

356
00:15:11,729 --> 00:15:15,400
dot Name has such a bizarrely spotted history behind it.

357
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:21,070
The, the intent being like, for example, if I went Josh dot Bresser dot Name,

358
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,080
I would have bought Josh dot Bresser dot Name, but,

359
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,669
but nobody could ever control like Bresser dot Name.

360
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:27,140
Right.

361
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:31,099
With the, that was the idea and then it failed and then they let you buy anything.

362
00:15:31,109 --> 00:15:31,770
So I bought Bresser

363
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,659
dot Name,

364
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,580
which doesn't even do anything. I just own it because,

365
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,299
and, and it's,

366
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:37,789
yeah,

367
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,739
it sucks down because actually doing anything useful with the,

368
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,409
with that domain is painful.

369
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:43,849
Yeah.

370
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:44,979
So anyway,

371
00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:45,739
-- but,
-- uh,

372
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,950
no, I think part of it is on the one hand it reminds me of github.

373
00:15:49,989 --> 00:15:51,219
I am terrified that github

374
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:53,780
will go evil one day but on the flip side,

375
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:58,020
by having it centralized and having it well done centrally,

376
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:01,750
it's made developers lives so much simpler.

377
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:07,590
Like I look at the CV project and for, for like Miter and CV E to run a proper GIT

378
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:11,109
server publicly with accounts and with all that other stuff

379
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,400
versus,

380
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,549
oh, it's free at github.com.

381
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,099
No, I, I totally get that.

382
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,830
Well, here's so github

383
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,150
is going to go evil someday. I mean,

384
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:23,869
remember Source Forge

385
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,900
-- those, those were the good guys for a long time.
-- Oh, man.

386
00:16:26,909 --> 00:16:28,309
Every time I have to download the

387
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,630
Dan dot Iso.

388
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,640
And I love the fact that in Firefox it's like, no,

389
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:36,349
it like blocks the domains and stuff or whatever the,

390
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,059
you know, because it's like, so

391
00:16:38,229 --> 00:16:38,239
I

392
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,909
know stupid at this point.

393
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:42,130
No, I know. In fact, I downloaded

394
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:46,280
Dan the other day and I was like, what is this? This is terrible.

395
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,929
Actually, that's something I was thinking of.

396
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,440
Somebody should put together like a mini

397
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,369
Iso and, you know,

398
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:55,690
build one of these small container type operating systems that just let's face it.

399
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:55,830
Dan

400
00:16:56,109 --> 00:16:59,250
doesn't do anything that exciting. Like I could probably do it in an hour.

401
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:00,859
But anyway,

402
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:01,340
github

403
00:17:01,489 --> 00:17:03,080
is going to go evil someday

404
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:03,539
and,

405
00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:06,140
and N PM is probably going to become evil someday

406
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,348
because I think it's just the nature of these things

407
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:09,098
and

408
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,810
-- when that happens it's
-- not that they go evil.

409
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:16,439
It's that what their interests and my interests are no longer in as close alignment.

410
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:18,420
That's fair. That's fair. I don't.

411
00:17:18,598 --> 00:17:22,239
Ok. Ok. I, I like that better. That's, that's a nice way to put it,

412
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:24,810
but at the same time when that happens,

413
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:27,339
it generally happens because the world has moved on

414
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:28,410
github

415
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:32,930
will become Source forge when we're using whatever comes after github.

416
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,150
And I have no idea what that will be GVR,

417
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:37,770
right?

418
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,930
He VR source control. That's it.

419
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:40,319
Right.

420
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:44,119
It'll be just like uh was the movie hackers where you're flying around the building?

421
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,449
Exactly.

422
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:51,729
Yeah. So, I mean, as far as actual actionable advice goes to people,

423
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:55,300
there are like various things in N PM and CP and

424
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,660
whatnot that will help you cash local copies of it.

425
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:01,280
So, you know, you would at least have those if like I said, N pm.org

426
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,959
goes away or if

427
00:18:03,189 --> 00:18:06,209
somebody, some developer sites to delete something that, you know,

428
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:10,069
is a dependency of a dependency of a dependency of something you, you know, rely upon

429
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,329
fundamentally.

430
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:12,380
I mean, it's,

431
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,290
it's up to the central organizations and I think

432
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,119
one of the biggest things that could help here

433
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,560
would be having,

434
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,890
you know, good transparency around what are the rules.

435
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,699
What like what is the behavior we can expect?

436
00:18:23,709 --> 00:18:29,579
Like under what circumstances might this package go away or get deleted or be,

437
00:18:29,869 --> 00:18:32,939
you know, just otherwise something happened that I care about

438
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:34,250
you know,

439
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,520
and I think that's one of the benefits like

440
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,189
of a lot of open source projects like, you know, Debian, for example,

441
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:43,469
they have some really clearly stated policy documents about when

442
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:47,619
and how and why they'll move or remove packages,

443
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,359
right? Like license violations or you know the code blah, blah, blah, right?

444
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:56,550
-- And so you kind of know what to expect.
-- Well, yes

445
00:18:56,729 --> 00:18:59,800
and I like that consistency, but at the same time,

446
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,369
I think because of that policy and consistency,

447
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,109
Debian also moves a lot slower than some of these other distributions do

448
00:19:06,219 --> 00:19:11,069
well, totally. And and we exist in a universe now where where speed

449
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,630
is seen as kind of the the killer feature for many,

450
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:15,540
many

451
00:19:15,869 --> 00:19:18,829
-- time
-- to market has always been a thing and

452
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:21,910
especially with software now time to market is like super

453
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,880
critical, especially with services, right? Because uh

454
00:19:26,089 --> 00:19:29,689
like a great example is Cloudflare cloud flare could have built something totally

455
00:19:29,699 --> 00:19:33,420
amazing and beautiful and engineered even more perfectly than what they built.

456
00:19:33,979 --> 00:19:35,540
But you know, if they'd waited a year,

457
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,380
somebody else would have come along and eat their lunch.

458
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,819
Uh You know, same thing with github, right?

459
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:40,310
Github.

460
00:19:40,739 --> 00:19:41,280
I remember

461
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,359
github at the beginning, it was, it was good.

462
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:47,489
I mean it was hosting Git and that alone took away so much pain,

463
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,959
like so so much pain and then, you know,

464
00:19:49,969 --> 00:19:53,130
they've continued to add and add and add features like this whole dependency,

465
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,000
security checker thing.

466
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,130
Is like, wow, that, ok. That's really cool.

467
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,670
Yes. You know, stuff like that will, you know,

468
00:20:00,089 --> 00:20:00,349
and,

469
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:01,939
and they're getting to a point now where they kind

470
00:20:01,949 --> 00:20:04,089
of have that moat around them where it's like,

471
00:20:04,099 --> 00:20:05,800
oh, I could totally move to some other git

472
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:09,709
style hosting thing. But I would lose, well, at a minimum I would lose the github

473
00:20:09,969 --> 00:20:10,630
community

474
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,369
right

475
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:12,219
at

476
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:14,550
this point. It's,

477
00:20:15,229 --> 00:20:17,430
there's nowhere better. I mean, let's face it.

478
00:20:17,729 --> 00:20:18,050
Yeah.

479
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,780
Well, there's nowhere as popular. It's like Facebook.

480
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:24,849
Are there other social networks? I guess I, I couldn't even name them.

481
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:27,000
-- The
-- young people like Snapchat,

482
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,829
which is not controlled by Facebook,

483
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:32,349
the medium age people think Instagram is neat which

484
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:34,890
Facebook owns and the old people like Facebook,

485
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,189
that is pretty much the way of the world today.

486
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:41,630
And, and I think that's actually a great example and I wonder I should,

487
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,989
I should look into this but like, obviously I can understand, like,

488
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,849
if your grandparents are on Facebook, Facebook isn't cool.

489
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:47,689
Let's face it.

490
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,260
That's the reality of that.

491
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:50,140
And

492
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:54,630
-- if you look at development environments, is it generational
-- part of it?

493
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,449
Is it is generational.

494
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,540
Because one thing I've really noticed

495
00:20:58,739 --> 00:21:01,510
is the difference between cloud services being

496
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,660
built by people who grew up with cloud

497
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,819
that is to put up long with people around the age of 20 to 25

498
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:07,729
and the cloud

499
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:09,454
stuff being built by

500
00:21:09,844 --> 00:21:12,785
the older generation. A great example being Amazon web services

501
00:21:12,915 --> 00:21:14,295
they wrote the whole thing in Java

502
00:21:14,494 --> 00:21:18,625
and now they're like, would we use a different technology stack if we built this?

503
00:21:18,635 --> 00:21:19,604
Oh God, yes.

504
00:21:19,635 --> 00:21:22,814
Except, uh we've kind of invested in this and, you know,

505
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:26,094
we're not stupid enough to try and rewrite from scratch and go bankrupt,

506
00:21:27,175 --> 00:21:27,535
you know.

507
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:28,449
Right.

508
00:21:28,459 --> 00:21:29,560
Like, literally,

509
00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:31,530
if you tried to convince somebody under the age of

510
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,520
25 right now to write a major thing in Java,

511
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,239
they'd be like, you mean javascript, right?

512
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,400
Like no Js like that would probably be their reaction.

513
00:21:39,609 --> 00:21:43,160
Yes, I'm familiar with this problem at the same time though.

514
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:48,540
I, I will say Java does solve some problems very nicely but speed isn't one of them.

515
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,229
-- Well,
-- Java

516
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:49,479
is,

517
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:53,709
it's provably, it gets things done. I mean Aws, right?

518
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:56,209
That is a heck of a successful software stack. Yeah.

519
00:21:56,219 --> 00:21:59,349
So I mean, I, I think part of, and part of it is the culture of like

520
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:02,469
you and I are like, I literally remember back in um

521
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,329
oh Lord, 1999

522
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:08,150
I taught a full day Linux security course at Vanguard Security Expo,

523
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,069
which is mainframe security people back in the day.

524
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:14,790
And about there were uh eight or nine people in the class

525
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,449
and I kind of had to at one point stop and explain client server computing

526
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:23,849
in the sense of clients that were intelligent and not dumb.

527
00:22:23,979 --> 00:22:26,599
Like they got client server in the context of like, oh yeah.

528
00:22:26,609 --> 00:22:28,369
T and 3270 terminal, which

529
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:31,709
I'm guessing most people are gonna have to Google or look up on Wikipedia.

530
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:32,930
If you're under the age of

531
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:35,369
probably 40 you've probably never seen or heard of those.

532
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,640
And so I had to explain to them kind

533
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:39,199
of like why client server computing with Linux and,

534
00:22:39,209 --> 00:22:40,920
you know, smart clients was a little bit different,

535
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,489
why there was a much different sort of security profile around that.

536
00:22:45,109 --> 00:22:49,229
And it kind of, I think some of them were not super enchanted about, you know,

537
00:22:49,489 --> 00:22:53,569
having their security go from like a single machine to like, oh, all the machines.

538
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:57,640
I, I'm from that generational gap too where I look at a web app and I think about

539
00:22:57,859 --> 00:23:00,930
so how do we optimize processing on the back end versus, you know,

540
00:23:00,939 --> 00:23:02,699
young people now are smart and they're like,

541
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,689
just do it in javascript on the client, right? Scale out 100% right?

542
00:23:06,699 --> 00:23:08,579
For every client that connects,

543
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:12,689
-- that's a new server.
-- Yes. But however, ironically

544
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,530
that is going to bring with it, many of the same problems where you have,

545
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:22,130
have issues with having to trust the client because the client could be malicious.

546
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:25,680
-- Well, and that doesn't really matter in a lot of apps.
-- Right. I mean, certain things.

547
00:23:25,689 --> 00:23:27,560
It certainly doesn't. I, I agree with that.

548
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:32,170
Well, like banking apps, like, oh, you wanted to withdraw $73 billion? Cool.

549
00:23:32,939 --> 00:23:35,410
Yeah, you probably need to check those numbers on the back end, right?

550
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,250
But fundamentally, I mean, especially with like games and stuff, right? Like

551
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:43,290
it anyways, the point being is that there is definitely a cultural divide

552
00:23:43,449 --> 00:23:45,630
between, like, as I kind of put it, there's,

553
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:50,030
there's sort of the the server client application mindset which, you know,

554
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:55,510
roamed the earth and was supreme from like what about 95 until 2005,

555
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,229
2008.

556
00:23:57,939 --> 00:23:59,479
And then we kind of entered that

557
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:02,479
transition where clients became like

558
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:05,760
even the worst client. Like my cell phone is what?

559
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:08,319
Dual core with four gigs of ra M or something stupid.

560
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,500
Right? Like, I don't even know or care anymore. It, it'll run,

561
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:12,130
it'll do

562
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,599
-- like it'll do augmented reality games on my phone,
-- right?

563
00:24:15,619 --> 00:24:19,719
-- You know, if it's in my pocket, it,
-- it probably has something crazy like six cars or

564
00:24:20,219 --> 00:24:21,770
it, it, that's a funny thing.

565
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:21,969
Now,

566
00:24:21,979 --> 00:24:25,310
it's even crazier because they're actually these chips now have like two low

567
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:29,030
power cores and then they might have two or four high power cores.

568
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,079
So when the phone is asleep it uses way less juice,

569
00:24:32,369 --> 00:24:34,079
which is awesome. Right.

570
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:35,319
Yeah.

571
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:35,930
Yeah.

572
00:24:36,219 --> 00:24:37,199
And so,

573
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:40,510
you know, and then there's this whole sort of cloud native client

574
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:44,359
generation where like the client is essentially what we think of as

575
00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:47,880
a server as far as power and compute capability and storage goes.

576
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,520
No, II, I totally get it.

577
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,459
My kids, ipads have 100 and 28 gigs of storage each I remember seeing servers with,

578
00:24:54,135 --> 00:24:57,094
well, I remember owning servers with one gig of storage and I was like,

579
00:24:57,104 --> 00:24:58,375
super happy about that.

580
00:24:58,385 --> 00:25:00,094
-- We'll
-- never fill this disk out.

581
00:25:00,104 --> 00:25:04,094
-- So,
-- you know, there is definitely that generational divide with,

582
00:25:04,104 --> 00:25:08,055
not just in language and, but in how they view the world,

583
00:25:08,064 --> 00:25:11,114
it's like those kids that pick up a phone and they're like, like a dumb phone,

584
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:12,135
like a cordless phone

585
00:25:12,604 --> 00:25:16,045
and are like, what, where's the screen? Like, why, what? There's no touchscreen?

586
00:25:16,055 --> 00:25:19,614
-- This is broken, what's going on?
-- Let's, let's bring this one home.

587
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:21,734
But you've got me thinking something

588
00:25:21,964 --> 00:25:22,694
is

589
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,170
maybe,

590
00:25:25,089 --> 00:25:29,800
maybe we are solving yesterday's security problems. Oh, very definitely.

591
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:34,069
And we're trying to project those problems onto the technology of today

592
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,349
instead of building today's security solutions.

593
00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:41,680
Right. I, I, everything you said resonates with me.

594
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:43,160
Well, I think you're right because

595
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:46,959
one example of this is, you know, if you do Dev ops in our trial,

596
00:25:46,969 --> 00:25:49,469
who cares if you have a security flaw, we fixed it in five minutes

597
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,400
because you're definitely gonna have security flaws no matter what you write.

598
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:56,140
Now, now, on that note though, you have to know about them. It's part of the trick

599
00:25:56,339 --> 00:26:01,099
and that can be tricky although I guess maybe just keep updating a lot and,

600
00:26:01,109 --> 00:26:02,939
-- and then you don't
-- care continuous deployment.

601
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:04,430
Why here's

602
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:07,280
why bother tracking security flaws in your dependencies

603
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:08,939
if you update your dependencies every day.

604
00:26:08,969 --> 00:26:13,579
But then we've gotten to the issue of? Ok. So I'm updating my dependencies every day.

605
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:17,560
Am I, should I cash them locally? Should I care if they're cashed locally?

606
00:26:17,569 --> 00:26:18,670
And, and I feel like

607
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:23,439
everything we've talked about up till now about the supply chain is very much

608
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,160
the security problems of yesterday.

609
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,890
Now, the security problems of today,

610
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,339
but we're trying to project our solution onto today.

611
00:26:30,349 --> 00:26:31,640
I need, I need to think about this.

612
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:34,000
Well, I think one thing you and I fundamentally get wrong

613
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:36,719
is we look at software as something that ships.

614
00:26:37,489 --> 00:26:39,140
The majority of software

615
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:40,060
is

616
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,849
-- not shipped, it's either used internally or it's provided as a service
-- now.

617
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:46,430
Well, and as a service is totally the future man.

618
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:49,800
I mean, if you look even like elastic as a new company and our,

619
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:53,020
our cloud offering obviously is, is becoming hugely

620
00:26:53,569 --> 00:26:56,589
not that the other, the other stuff is hugely popular also. But

621
00:26:56,729 --> 00:26:58,520
yeah, as a serviceman, it's where it's at.

622
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:00,910
Well, from the customer perspective, it's easier. And from the

623
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,150
company perspective,

624
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,699
there's no more piracy and there's no more people not

625
00:27:04,709 --> 00:27:06,339
paying their bills because they don't pay their bills.

626
00:27:06,349 --> 00:27:06,910
You turn it off.

627
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,589
Well, and not only that,

628
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:13,670
the the the dealing with support on something as a service is much nicer

629
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,329
because

630
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,859
you have basically access to everything.

631
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:18,729
You can see the logs, right?

632
00:27:18,739 --> 00:27:21,949
You can, you can figure out what's going on, you can say, oh, I see what, you know,

633
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:23,140
there's a mistake here.

634
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,750
I see you're trying to do this. So

635
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:27,109
it's, it's huge, man. I mean, I think

636
00:27:27,709 --> 00:27:33,310
there are few instances where IC N A service being inferior to on prem today and I

637
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:35,449
know that that's something that people complain about and

638
00:27:35,459 --> 00:27:37,189
there's a whole bunch of articles popping up.

639
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:39,150
It feels like since the new Year talking about, oh,

640
00:27:39,339 --> 00:27:41,449
the public cloud is too expensive and insecure.

641
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:43,550
And I'm like, yeah, you're, who's paying you, right? You,

642
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:47,609
you didn't make this up. Someone's paying you to say that and I don't know who it is.

643
00:27:47,619 --> 00:27:48,069
But

644
00:27:48,569 --> 00:27:49,400
anyway,

645
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,329
well, I think

646
00:27:50,459 --> 00:27:53,130
there are, well, I think it's like any technology that

647
00:27:53,449 --> 00:27:54,530
things like

648
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,219
the public cloud will definitely take off and eat up a huge

649
00:27:58,229 --> 00:28:01,369
part of the market and there will always be those like niche

650
00:28:01,589 --> 00:28:05,079
situations or you have regulatory guidelines or whatever.

651
00:28:05,109 --> 00:28:08,920
But yeah, to say blanket statements like, oh the the cloud,

652
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:13,079
like I look at the CS A what we pay Amazon web services and the weird thing is

653
00:28:13,219 --> 00:28:17,900
we've consistently paid them the same amount plus or minus $100 for four years

654
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:21,510
and we use more and more resources every month and year.

655
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:24,040
But because Amazon keeps dropping their prices

656
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:26,739
and they keep coming out with services.

657
00:28:26,819 --> 00:28:28,069
So for example,

658
00:28:28,349 --> 00:28:30,989
I no longer have to buy SSL certificates because

659
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:34,869
Amazon provides that for free. Right. Amazon certificate.

660
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,770
You, it's just free.

661
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:38,410
Yes. Right.

662
00:28:38,699 --> 00:28:42,969
And, and like a wild card certificate for a domain is like a couple 100 bucks a year.

663
00:28:42,979 --> 00:28:43,729
And so

664
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:47,229
two or three of those go away. Like, wow, it's like 1000 bucks a year.

665
00:28:47,449 --> 00:28:48,660
No, I know, man, I know.

666
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,689
Let's call it, let's call it.

667
00:28:50,699 --> 00:28:51,250
So anyway,

668
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:54,410
let's just say this parents stop projecting your problems and your Children.

669
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:54,969
Right.

670
00:28:54,979 --> 00:28:59,209
That's, that's what this is us as parents are projecting our security problems on,

671
00:28:59,219 --> 00:29:00,359
on the youth future

672
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:00,729
and

673
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:01,189
so

674
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,890
youth, it's up to you to keep giving us a finger and telling us to go away.

675
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:08,300
-- So there we go. Problem solved.
-- Don't trust anybody over 40.

676
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,829
Just don't trust anybody. Right. It's much easier that way.

677
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:13,750
Don't, don't draw lines. Thanks, Kurt. Thanks everyone for listening.
