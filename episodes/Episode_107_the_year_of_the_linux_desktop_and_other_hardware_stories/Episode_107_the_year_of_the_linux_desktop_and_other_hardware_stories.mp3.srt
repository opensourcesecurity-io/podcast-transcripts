Hello and welcome to episode 107 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,789 --> 00:00:12,159
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:12,899 --> 00:00:17,639
All Kurt. I'm going to call 2018 as the year of the Linux

3
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,610
desktop.

4
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:19,940
I'm inclined to agree

5
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:21,209
for real,

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,719
for real. Like it's been

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:24,520
a

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,250
year forever.

9
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:26,770
Right.

10
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:30,729
And, and I feel like we made it, we finally made it, but ironically,

11
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,139
we didn't make it for the reasons anyone thought we know

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:33,950
-- we
-- were

13
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,810
because the year the Linux desktop is

14
00:00:37,819 --> 00:00:41,610
going to exist because of chromebooks and windows

15
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:42,509
and android

16
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:42,750
phone.

17
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,270
I consider that less desktop

18
00:00:46,389 --> 00:00:51,250
than chromebooks. I mean, a phone is a phone whereas a chromebook is a computer,

19
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:52,529
a desktop.

20
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,090
And I think that's part of the thing.

21
00:00:54,319 --> 00:00:57,090
The desktop thing is a dying metaphor

22
00:00:58,389 --> 00:00:58,529
shipments

23
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:58,830
are,

24
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:00,520
everybody's got a smartphone.

25
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:00,659
Now.

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,339
Did I buy? I don't even remember the last time I bought a computer.

27
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,550
It's, it's been a while, I

28
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:05,690
think

29
00:01:06,029 --> 00:01:06,739
for my kids,

30
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,190
my kids play games on a windows machine, but that's it.

31
00:01:10,199 --> 00:01:11,980
Uh But anyway, anyway, we should explain this.

32
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,730
So, and, and why is the security podcast talking about a desktop.

33
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:19,819
So this is a bunch of bizarrely related things come together.

34
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,059
So, chromebooks have been around for a while and they're insanely inexpensive.

35
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:24,180
In fact, I have one

36
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,379
and it's what I use when I travel and it works

37
00:01:27,389 --> 00:01:30,199
perfectly and I have no issues with it and it's obviously ultra

38
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,010
secure compared to any laptop

39
00:01:32,279 --> 00:01:34,709
except maybe some of the windows stuff. But that's another story.

40
00:01:34,809 --> 00:01:35,809
But anyway, anyway,

41
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:36,139
so

42
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:36,680
you

43
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,860
have to, you have to work to make it secure. It doesn't come out of the box that way.

44
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,410
Typically

45
00:01:41,699 --> 00:01:43,019
that's fair. That's fair. You know,

46
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,639
unless you work for

47
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,569
which nobody does.

48
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,669
I've tried walking down the biases and these things. It's, it's,

49
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:55,199
it's a nontrivial task and I

50
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:55,849
know some of

51
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,790
-- the
-- new ones are OK.

52
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,069
Some of the new ones come locked down by default and

53
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,699
you have to actually unlock the stuff if you want it.

54
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:05,459
But anyway, anyway, so chromebooks

55
00:02:05,589 --> 00:02:08,639
are basically desktops. They're, they're basically web browsers

56
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:09,470
and

57
00:02:09,877 --> 00:02:12,828
you now have the ability on a select number of chromebooks.

58
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:15,018
I'm very exciting because at the end of July mine gets it

59
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:17,768
is you have the ability to run native Linux

60
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:21,979
apps in the chromebook. And I guess it's using some magic container technology.

61
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:25,468
But this is super exciting because now I have like an ultra portable,

62
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,779
ultra secure device

63
00:02:27,179 --> 00:02:30,259
that is essentially my Linux desktop and it's,

64
00:02:30,438 --> 00:02:31,089
I, I

65
00:02:31,268 --> 00:02:32,858
don't even know what to say.

66
00:02:32,988 --> 00:02:33,938
It's awesome.

67
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:34,578
Yeah.

68
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:35,738
Well,

69
00:02:35,748 --> 00:02:37,098
the other thing that I like about chromebooks

70
00:02:37,108 --> 00:02:39,048
is similar to Apple is that they keep state

71
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,440
sort of natively,

72
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,759
like, you don't have to set up something to do data replication and all sorts of

73
00:02:45,149 --> 00:02:46,720
stuff to get your data,

74
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:50,639
not just backed up, but like in real time synchronized to another device. So that

75
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,679
God forbid you like,

76
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,729
want to edit a thing on your phone and put your phone

77
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,869
in your pocket and then immediately start editing it on your laptop

78
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,800
and not have to do some like black magic in between to get it to work.

79
00:03:02,809 --> 00:03:07,440
Well, not only that, I mean, one of the things I love about it is, is part of that story.

80
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:11,160
So my chromebook cost me $250 dirt cheap.

81
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,179
And, and I have the opinion of like,

82
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,250
let's say I go through airport security and they take my

83
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:17,130
computer away from me and they give it back to me

84
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,669
that's going to go in the garbage can as soon as I walk away from the TS a checkpoint.

85
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:22,440
Right. And I won't think twice

86
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:23,600
about

87
00:03:23,839 --> 00:03:28,520
getting all my stuff back because it's all magic. Right? It's super cool like that.

88
00:03:28,529 --> 00:03:29,399
I really dig it.

89
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,399
And so that's one of the beauties of traveling with that versus traveling with,

90
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,330
you know, a multi $1000 laptop.

91
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,149
Yeah. No, I just checked my laptop is from 2012

92
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:41,830
and I haven't bothered upgrading it because everything's in the cloud it's

93
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,179
like

94
00:03:42,429 --> 00:03:42,770
ancient man.

95
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:44,350
Well, that's the thing.

96
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,880
I'm looking at the hardware specs for some of

97
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:48,429
these newer tablets and phones and chromebooks and it's like

98
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,580
they are pretty solid machines. Like, generally speaking at least four gigs of ra M

99
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:56,929
ac pui, I don't know what that means anymore.

100
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,800
Like, I know, I think it's,

101
00:03:57,809 --> 00:04:01,380
the newer Apple phones have like two fast cores and four slow cores for

102
00:04:01,649 --> 00:04:02,929
stuff to

103
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,880
-- save battery. And I don't know,
-- I've got so

104
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:11,044
and my chromebook, I have four fast cars, two slow cars and so it's a six

105
00:04:11,214 --> 00:04:14,684
car chip which is weird, but whatever it works, I don't care.

106
00:04:15,115 --> 00:04:15,134
I

107
00:04:15,315 --> 00:04:15,354
don't

108
00:04:15,494 --> 00:04:15,535
think

109
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:16,375
-- so.
-- Yeah.

110
00:04:16,385 --> 00:04:18,904
No, I'm just, I'm looking at the hardware specs and all this stuff and like honestly,

111
00:04:18,915 --> 00:04:22,355
it all boils down to, yeah, it'll, it'll let me like watch video.

112
00:04:22,364 --> 00:04:23,255
It'll let me

113
00:04:23,635 --> 00:04:26,244
do all my office type work

114
00:04:26,654 --> 00:04:29,885
and even play some minimal games. So, yeah,

115
00:04:30,005 --> 00:04:32,315
you know, these things are under 500 bucks.

116
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,119
Uh Yeah,

117
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:35,489
seriously, man.

118
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:36,920
And they all run Linux

119
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,299
year of Linux desktop.

120
00:04:38,309 --> 00:04:42,769
Well, actually we should also point out why we jokingly said Windows is these days.

121
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:44,929
If you have a Windows desktop,

122
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,029
you can use what's called the Linux subsystem.

123
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,450
And you can like literally run Linux applications

124
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:52,869
on Windows and it works pretty well actually.

125
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:58,119
Oh, it works great because I needed an SSH client on my Windows machine.

126
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,720
So I went to the Apple or to the Microsoft store typed in SSH.

127
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,399
And the first result was ubuntu. So I'm like, yeah, whatever. Sure

128
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,450
Ubuntu has a copy of Open SSH, which is actually what I want.

129
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:10,920
I don't want some wonky home brew written copy of SSH,

130
00:05:11,109 --> 00:05:11,850
you know.

131
00:05:12,369 --> 00:05:17,839
Um And so I, I, yeah, I clicked it and like 10 minutes later after a reboot, I'm

132
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:23,190
running Linux in a container and the beauty is, it runs like an app like there's

133
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:24,160
it

134
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,329
when you type in Reboot, it says I can't do that because there's no process one,

135
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:29,500
there's no system to like I, I am a container.

136
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:33,040
I was instantiated, not like a computer but like a container.

137
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:36,619
And I love that I can just click the X in the corner and it, it's gone

138
00:05:36,809 --> 00:05:38,649
and when I reopen it, like

139
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:40,760
whatever state was on disk is saved,

140
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,920
right? So it's not like

141
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,600
it works for losing state or anything.

142
00:05:44,609 --> 00:05:48,320
And yeah, it's just, it's incredibly easy and simple and

143
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,510
yeah, I mean,

144
00:05:50,739 --> 00:05:54,130
it's, it's honestly, I, I'm not going to bother installing, you know,

145
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,920
I used to install sin the tool chain on my windows machine.

146
00:05:56,929 --> 00:05:58,209
So I'd have like said and a

147
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,679
and grab and all that stuff.

148
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,179
Yeah. Now, no, I just

149
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,079
click on the ubuntu icon and,

150
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:06,200
and go to slash MNT slash C mount C,

151
00:06:06,609 --> 00:06:09,839
you know, it natively mounts your C drive and all your local drives and just,

152
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,119
you can monkey around with your stuff.

153
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,739
-- No problem. Yep.
-- Yep. I, I wonder how many listeners we just lost

154
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:17,200
in the last three minutes.

155
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,670
But, you know, in context, I remember back in the day and by back in the day, I mean,

156
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:23,299
like 10 years ago,

157
00:06:23,309 --> 00:06:26,459
I would force myself for two weeks every summer to use Linux on my desktop

158
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:30,730
and get it fully working, sound everything and, like, really try hard to use Linux

159
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,179
and

160
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:33,700
invariably I just was like, oh, man,

161
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:36,980
this is just such a chore and I would give up and go back to,

162
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:37,579
you know,

163
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,250
Mac Os or Windows.

164
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,579
Um, and, and, and, and Linux in a virtual machine,

165
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:43,880
you know,

166
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,339
so I've been running Linux on my desktop probably for 20 years.

167
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,980
And it, it, it has reached the point now where it's a

168
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,679
non event.

169
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:58,640
And I remember back in the day when I was going to install the new version of something

170
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,079
usually Fedora or Red Hat Linux

171
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:03,040
that were that long ago,

172
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,609
like I remember I would set aside a weekend

173
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:09,250
to get it working and I needed it.

174
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,959
Right. It wasn't just, oh, I'll screw it up for a weekend.

175
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:12,299
Like, no,

176
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:16,890
I actually needed to work my behind off for a whole weekend to get my desktop working.

177
00:07:17,429 --> 00:07:20,529
Oh, no, I, I ran Linux on the desktop slackware one point.

178
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,510
Oh, and some other things because what else was there?

179
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,190
But what I'm just realizing too is

180
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,279
if I run Linux,

181
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,920
I can't really easily run windows or Mac O SI can run windows in a VM,

182
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:32,279
but I can't really run Mac Os at all.

183
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:35,619
Whereas if I'm running Mac Os or Windows, I can trivially run Linux

184
00:07:35,859 --> 00:07:36,339
now.

185
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,959
Yes, that, that is a very good point.

186
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,899
It's, although, you know, man, I find like, II,

187
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,329
I purposely make myself switch between different kinds of

188
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,779
desktops just so I can keep it kind of fresh

189
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,859
and honestly like on, on Mac O si just open a shell and I use my web browser.

190
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:54,549
It's basically as good as Linux.

191
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,880
I mean, honestly, I don't notice a difference.

192
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:01,799
I removed my virtual machines that I had for my previous job and

193
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,220
yeah, Mac

194
00:08:03,429 --> 00:08:03,869
Os command

195
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:06,649
shell. Uh I did have to install a newer version of GP G.

196
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,290
That was basically the only thing I needed

197
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,970
and home brew obviously to get all the

198
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,149
news said

199
00:08:11,299 --> 00:08:12,890
because the Mac Os said does not

200
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:14,190
-- home
-- brew

201
00:08:14,429 --> 00:08:15,640
-- line
-- returns.

202
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:17,399
The

203
00:08:17,549 --> 00:08:17,579
Mac

204
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:19,059
Os utilities are

205
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:20,459
they're

206
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:20,910
broken,

207
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:22,609
they're straight up broken. Like,

208
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:25,309
like go read the man page for

209
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,250
said on Mac Os and what you need to do to handle line returns.

210
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,230
And compared to like GNU said where it's trivial.

211
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,750
Yeah. No, it's

212
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:33,799
Yeah. No.

213
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:34,169
Yeah,

214
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:35,950
but that's probably because they're using like some

215
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,950
1965 version of AT&T set or something.

216
00:08:41,859 --> 00:08:44,909
But I guess here's, here's the thing I keep thinking of here is, you know,

217
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,989
why we can even have this conversation, man.

218
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,700
It's because like open source one

219
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:51,780
down

220
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,140
and what I really love is, is

221
00:08:54,669 --> 00:08:56,099
in the container space. Linux one,

222
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,700
right. Is there, is there any,

223
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,830
is anybody even making a really serious attempt to

224
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,580
have containers that are not based on Linux?

225
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,359
And the answer is, well, yeah, there's a, there's a couple of BS D things and what not.

226
00:09:06,369 --> 00:09:06,609
But they,

227
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,219
yeah, they're like those weirdos living out in the woods with sharp sticks.

228
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,280
You know, they, they mean, well, but you probably want to avoid them.

229
00:09:18,369 --> 00:09:18,960
You're gonna,

230
00:09:19,789 --> 00:09:21,950
don't, don't poke the bear cart.

231
00:09:22,099 --> 00:09:22,580
Just,

232
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,799
just don't

233
00:09:24,739 --> 00:09:27,609
anyway. Anyway. Anyway. All right. That's cool.

234
00:09:27,619 --> 00:09:29,280
But it's, I don't know, I'm excited.

235
00:09:29,289 --> 00:09:33,460
I think there's some, some fun stuff going on and I'm always happy to talk about it.

236
00:09:33,469 --> 00:09:35,890
-- But, but you have some other stories.
-- Yeah.

237
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:37,799
-- So, so
-- something that you wanted to discuss,

238
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,070
but I've kind of wondered why nobody wrote about this before is, um,

239
00:09:41,349 --> 00:09:42,789
thermal imaging cameras.

240
00:09:43,219 --> 00:09:45,489
And so when you type in a password, um,

241
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,630
obviously you generally touch the keys on your keyboard

242
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:52,330
and that would transfer some heat. And so, uh,

243
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:54,809
thermal imaging cameras now are, are quite affordable.

244
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,049
Like I was just looking online.

245
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,130
Uh, there's a really nifty one that plugs into the bottom of your phone,

246
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,520
either Apple or Android

247
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,700
200 bucks, apparently quite a nice,

248
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,460
uh,

249
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:05,710
infrared camera.

250
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:06,179
You know,

251
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,070
there's a couple of branded phones like a

252
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,190
Caterpillar actually makes a brand of phones,

253
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,239
you know, the heavy equipment

254
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:14,049
guys that paint all their stuff. Caterpillar yellow.

255
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,919
And they have a couple of, like, ruggedized

256
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,020
phones for

257
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,710
construction type people, I guess.

258
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:21,460
I don't know, but they have thermal cameras built into them. Which,

259
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,020
yeah, that'd be kind of useful.

260
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,419
You know, if you're looking at an engine or, like you said, you're,

261
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:26,940
where do I insulate my house?

262
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:28,849
Right.

263
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,369
There's, I'm sure there's countless uses

264
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:34,840
for it. I'm thinking especially with like pins, you know, on a pin pad.

265
00:10:34,849 --> 00:10:36,090
It's, it's, well,

266
00:10:36,229 --> 00:10:38,130
usually everybody has four digits.

267
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,849
Uh you can have six, but then you run the risk of that not working in Europe or America

268
00:10:43,219 --> 00:10:44,250
with older equipment.

269
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:49,000
Um, because I used to have a six digit pin and it works almost all the time

270
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,570
for my debit card.

271
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:56,869
A six digit pin. I don't think I've ever heard of a six digit pin for a debit card.

272
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,780
Yeah. So you, you can get,

273
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,489
uh, you can definitely get up to a six digit pin on most cards.

274
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,719
But like I said, if you encounter an older payment terminal,

275
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:07,359
you might have a bad day,

276
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:09,359
not in the US.

277
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:11,640
Like we don't use pins.

278
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,239
It's so bad.

279
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,320
But, um, but yeah,

280
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:15,739
like I'm surprised this hasn't kind of

281
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,159
come out sooner because apparently there's enough

282
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:21,719
heat left on these keyboards for a good 45 seconds to a minute to,

283
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,320
you know, basically get the person's um,

284
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,510
password and what I noticed I was actually watching

285
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,250
a tech tips and he is in their server room and he's logging into a server

286
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,880
and they actually blurred out his hands and

287
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,820
the keyboard while he's typing in the password.

288
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,369
And I was like, oh, yeah, because you could, you know,

289
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,090
have the youtube video go through at like quarter speed or whatever

290
00:11:39,289 --> 00:11:42,039
and you'd clearly be able to see what key is hitting.

291
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:42,840
Sure.

292
00:11:43,109 --> 00:11:43,630
Yeah.

293
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,080
And this is one thing that gets me,

294
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:47,000
especially around two factor authentication is that,

295
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:49,650
you know, especially in office environments, it's just,

296
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:51,989
it's people can watch you type

297
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,099
unless you're like in an office

298
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:57,570
room facing a backing into a wall or something. You know,

299
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,210
it's like when people discover the cameras are good enough now

300
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,630
to easily take a picture of a key and you know,

301
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,369
you can figure out what the bidding, the cut pattern is.

302
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,890
-- Your,
-- your fingerprints, man, right? You can take pictures of fingerprints. Now

303
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,039
most,

304
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:12,609
let's be brutally honest,

305
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:16,010
any decent phone nowadays has at least a 10 megapixel camera,

306
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:22,919
right? I remember buying a one megapixel camera for like 500 bucks back in the day,

307
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:24,539
you know,

308
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,359
it was,

309
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,349
did it take

310
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,710
pretty much? I think I'm, I'm restricted to

311
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,719
-- 16
-- megabyte

312
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,820
SD cards.

313
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:34,739
But um yeah, I mean, the reality is like modern phones,

314
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,869
some of them have upwards of 20 or 30 megapixel cameras.

315
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,190
And

316
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,450
yeah, like if you're doing that, what is it that um the, the,

317
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,000
that

318
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,250
the, the thing that the, you know,

319
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,950
where they hold their fingers up in the peace symbol.

320
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,280
Whenever they take a photo, it's like this iconic thing,

321
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:50,979
I think that the Japanese do or something.

322
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:51,909
And yeah,

323
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:54,840
like you're holding your fingers up to the picture and

324
00:12:54,849 --> 00:12:57,390
apparently these cameras are good enough now that you can like

325
00:12:57,599 --> 00:13:00,000
literally see us. I, you know, enhance, enhance.

326
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,349
Oh you have the killer's fingerprint,

327
00:13:02,229 --> 00:13:02,880
you know,

328
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:07,020
but like legitimately, you know, and, and that's the thing that gets me right is

329
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:07,619
it,

330
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,650
we always go back to, you know, security through obscurity never works.

331
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,190
Um Largely because most security through obscurity,

332
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,530
you can't change what it is you're hiding, right?

333
00:13:16,849 --> 00:13:19,559
So with passwords, you can argue that you can change your password quickly.

334
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,250
So it's not so terrible, but like, yeah, something like your fingerprint.

335
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,840
Uh Well, you can technically change your fingerprint, but it's going to hurt

336
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:26,650
a lot.

337
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:31,419
And so I think any security that kind of relies on something

338
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,429
never being physically seen by an attacker. A great example being like a key,

339
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,419
you know, I think we need to start

340
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:41,260
thinking about these things because II, I know people,

341
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,969
like I've seen people that wear their key ring on their belt

342
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,590
and you could easily take a picture of

343
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,750
most of that thing and, and get the bidding of most of the keys.

344
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,500
I would argue keys are different

345
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,340
because

346
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,820
let's face it. There are

347
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,010
janitor with a master key on his key ring.

348
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:04,830
Yeah. But even with that man, do you know how easy it is to pick basically every line on

349
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:09,169
the planet today? I mean, with a bump key, you can pick it in literally four seconds.

350
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,210
I mean, keys are to keep honest people out, they are not to keep evildoers out.

351
00:14:14,219 --> 00:14:17,030
And I think that's kind of the difference with passwords is passwords

352
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:19,859
are meant to keep evil doers out and honest people out.

353
00:14:19,869 --> 00:14:21,000
Right. And, and

354
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:21,650
I

355
00:14:22,849 --> 00:14:24,909
really, if we kind of think about

356
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:28,359
passwords, like we think about keys,

357
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,000
a password is really to keep the honest people out,

358
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:34,460
but you need two factor on now if you want to keep the evil doers out.

359
00:14:34,469 --> 00:14:35,849
Right? I mean, that's probably the right way.

360
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:38,559
Part of the challenge is if you have just a password,

361
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:43,059
then you really do need things like account lockouts for bad logins or, you know,

362
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:46,309
like slowdowns like, ok, it's, I'm gonna make you wait 10 seconds,

363
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,729
I'm gonna make you wait 20 seconds.

364
00:14:47,969 --> 00:14:51,349
And that's great with like a physical device, like a phone.

365
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:51,919
But

366
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,150
that really sucks if I'm trying to log into like

367
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,390
my gmail

368
00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:00,429
and some Russian dude hammered it and now I can't log in for like half a day,

369
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:01,890
right? Because that's, that's,

370
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,450
that's actually one of the cwe identifiers is like

371
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,549
overly aggressive account lockout because I've literally seen systems

372
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:09,650
where you get three bad logins and the system

373
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,390
locks you out completely and you have to,

374
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,789
like, get the admin to let you back in

375
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:16,109
which, you know, for some crazy high security environment maybe.

376
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,049
But, like,

377
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:20,450
you can't put that online because then everybody will be locked out in half an hour.

378
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:21,219
Yeah.

379
00:15:21,229 --> 00:15:21,460
My,

380
00:15:21,469 --> 00:15:25,760
my bank does that where if I type my password in wrong more than three times I

381
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:30,299
have to then provide them with an obscene amount of information to prove it to me.

382
00:15:30,989 --> 00:15:32,469
And it, it, it sucks.

383
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:36,450
But I guess, and that one I can probably let go and it doesn't happen very often.

384
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,719
It's, it's usually,

385
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,590
for some reason I end up accidentally hitting

386
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:43,090
buttons while I'm pasting the password from,

387
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,450
from the password manager.

388
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:48,549
Yeah. Or at least they don't have the cut and paste disabled in javascript. Right.

389
00:15:49,859 --> 00:15:51,309
Oh, my goodness.

390
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,559
II, I, yeah,

391
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:57,280
I'm actually going to be campaigning this year probably to make that like a flaw.

392
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,239
Like if you block, cut and paste, that's a flaw. Don't do that.

393
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:06,119
-- I agree. That should, that should get a CV E unquestionably like it.
-- Well, and a CV,

394
00:16:07,739 --> 00:16:11,719
-- get them both.
-- And then the other big hardware news. Well, not really big news again.

395
00:16:11,729 --> 00:16:12,820
It's been for a while, but like,

396
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,570
if you buy an evil replacement screen for your smartphone, like,

397
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,330
obviously it can see what you're typing

398
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,369
because, like, the screen is also the keyboard. Right?

399
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,099
And you can also impersonate them too. Right.

400
00:16:23,109 --> 00:16:25,710
Because the, the, the screen sends the signals to the,

401
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,840
to the computer saying, you know, they tap over here, they tap over here,

402
00:16:28,849 --> 00:16:30,469
they swipe this, right?

403
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,250
And so it sounds like, you know, for example, Apple is dealing with this by

404
00:16:34,739 --> 00:16:38,169
e essentially uh my understanding is the parts will, you know,

405
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:40,559
they'll have like a little encryption thing in them

406
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,460
that proves that they're part of the legitimate supply chain

407
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,359
and not some like off brand third party whatever piece,

408
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,099
right? Because

409
00:16:48,229 --> 00:16:50,539
when you think about it, right, if you have somebody like

410
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:54,460
replace the screen on your phone, like you have no idea where that screen came from.

411
00:16:54,609 --> 00:16:56,179
That, that is true.

412
00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:00,280
-- Like
-- is it a legit Apple screen or is it some third party thing or is it, who knows?

413
00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:00,710
Right.

414
00:17:00,929 --> 00:17:05,089
And now man, this one, I get torn over because

415
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:08,368
I'm sensitive to the concept of right to repair

416
00:17:08,469 --> 00:17:11,150
where if, if my phone does break,

417
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:16,660
I should be able to get it fixed wherever I want to. But and the other side of it,

418
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:20,650
there is something to be said about some of this kind of dodgy gear.

419
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:25,449
It's like Apple getting more and more restrictive with the

420
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:27,579
cables that you can use to plug your phone in,

421
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:28,500
right?

422
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,410
Because the the the lightning cables do have

423
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,380
again like a little encryption do hicky in them

424
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,650
like I have cables that used to work and then I

425
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,770
did an I OS update and then they stopped working.

426
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:39,849
See, that's lame, man. I'm sorry. That's lame.

427
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,300
And, well, it is.

428
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,880
But at the flip side you have these people

429
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:45,599
buying like really garbage cables and frying their phone.

430
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,770
Like that guy again.

431
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:50,670
Back to the Google guy that did those USB C cable testing and like fried his laptop

432
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:57,550
-- from a bad cable.
-- Yeah. But look if, if you fry your iphone on a bad cable,

433
00:17:58,069 --> 00:18:01,270
are, are they gonna, I assume they can tell,

434
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,810
-- are they going to replace it?
-- If it's Apple care?

435
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,020
Possibly if you're off Apple care, then that's your problem.

436
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,630
And more to the point you're what if it burns your house down?

437
00:18:10,949 --> 00:18:11,160
Right?

438
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,119
-- Because there's been pictures of some of these phones
-- that, like,

439
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,520
don't buy cheap stuff.

440
00:18:14,989 --> 00:18:16,459
Well, the problem is though, I don't know.

441
00:18:16,469 --> 00:18:20,040
How do I know that the expensive cable I'm buying is legit or not. And that's true.

442
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:23,719
You don't like? I know that the cheap stuff is probably not legit

443
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:26,859
but the expensive stuff like monster cables, those are expensive,

444
00:18:26,869 --> 00:18:27,520
aren't they legit?

445
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,359
I thought they were gold plated for your safety.

446
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:36,359
-- Did you ever see the website where some guy did a test of monster
-- cables?

447
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:37,540
The

448
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:37,689
coat

449
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:38,530
hanger.

450
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,890
Nobody could tell the difference.

451
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:46,780
I'm not even a little surprised and obviously digital is even funnier

452
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:48,189
but whatever

453
00:18:49,209 --> 00:18:49,709
in fairness,

454
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:51,489
I have had digital cables that were of such

455
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,199
poor quality or mangled that they actually were bad.

456
00:18:54,209 --> 00:18:55,719
But like these things have been like, chewed on.

457
00:18:55,729 --> 00:18:56,500
Basically,

458
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:59,969
I remember one time I bought a bunch of cheap cables

459
00:18:59,979 --> 00:19:03,160
of ebay and like half of them just wouldn't work.

460
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:04,400
They would,

461
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,300
they would plug in and it would start charging for

462
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,479
like two seconds and then it would just stop charging.

463
00:19:08,609 --> 00:19:12,010
And so I, I threw them away and then I bought nice cables

464
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,839
-- and I've never,
-- yeah, like a great example. Um,

465
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:18,040
in the car, you know, you have your old timey, we call them a power plug.

466
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:20,250
Now what they used to be for cigarette lighters, kids.

467
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,119
And so you have that little round thing that has the USB plugs on the end, right?

468
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,550
It's like basically a little physical adapter.

469
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:30,219
And I bought like a super cheap one thinking like, don't do, who cares? Right.

470
00:19:30,229 --> 00:19:32,800
It's just like a chunk of, it's basically a couple of bits of metal.

471
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:33,800
There's nothing in there. Really.

472
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:38,599
No. And uh so I found one where uh my phone won't charge off that one.

473
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,880
Like it provides power and it'll run like a dash cam.

474
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,099
But like you plug an iphone into it and the iphone's like, just like, no, I'm just,

475
00:19:45,109 --> 00:19:46,050
this thing is garbage.

476
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,699
I don't know what's going on. I'm not going to charge.

477
00:19:48,189 --> 00:19:50,890
And then I, I bought a nicer one, like uh

478
00:19:51,219 --> 00:19:55,010
it's a fancy one with like USB ports and the port, uh the, the,

479
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,839
the round ports and it's got like an on off

480
00:19:56,849 --> 00:19:58,719
switch and it shows you how much voltage it's drawing.

481
00:19:58,729 --> 00:19:59,290
It's pretty neat.

482
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:00,949
And that one works fine.

483
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:04,930
Yeah, I get it because I don't want to, like, save $3 and fry my phone. But

484
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:08,390
let's be honest, unless you go to the Apple store and buy the Apple cables, then

485
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,670
you have no idea.

486
00:20:10,069 --> 00:20:14,709
And in the Android ecosystem, like, where do you get provably good USB C cables?

487
00:20:14,979 --> 00:20:19,140
Uh, I go to Amazon and by the Amazon basics and I have the

488
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:19,780
assumption,

489
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,719
I assume they've done some level of quality control on their cable.

490
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:24,930
That's

491
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:25,300
fair

492
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:28,650
-- and
-- that's all. And again, it just goes back to having a brand to protect, right?

493
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,130
That's honestly as a consumer, that's about the only thing I can do.

494
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,930
This is a very similar problem to security

495
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,530
because

496
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,739
I don't know which cables are good.

497
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,310
Just like if I need a security product,

498
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:44,260
I have no way to know which security product is good.

499
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,209
And so

500
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,969
there might be some places I can rely on,

501
00:20:47,979 --> 00:20:51,739
on advice because maybe they make good decisions or they have a brand,

502
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,650
they're looking to protect.

503
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,089
But I mean,

504
00:20:53,449 --> 00:20:55,089
fundamentally at the end of the day,

505
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,699
like let's think about using open source libraries and github,

506
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,300
I have zero way to tell which one is the most secure.

507
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:06,449
Just like if I'm buying cables, I really don't know which is the best

508
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:11,500
and more to the point too, most software is so complex to objectively say,

509
00:21:12,209 --> 00:21:15,260
well, like, it's like whenever somebody does ratings of software,

510
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:18,410
I'm just like, yeah, nine out of 10. What does that mean?

511
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,260
Like, I get for games you can kind of rate games,

512
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:23,369
like it has good gameplay or it sucks with gameplay or it's got beautiful graphics,

513
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,180
terrible graphics.

514
00:21:24,189 --> 00:21:25,229
These are somewhat,

515
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,010
you know, they,

516
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,829
they're somewhat easy to understand the measurement and

517
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:31,540
to kind of validate the measurement but to,

518
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:34,550
like, look at a piece of software and say like, yeah, it's a nine out of 10 for a,

519
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,869
for an image library

520
00:21:37,449 --> 00:21:40,650
-- and,
-- and, and that's fair. And you think like power cables

521
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,170
and,

522
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,010
and power supplies would be very easy to

523
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:47,079
-- measure if somebody was
-- technically they're supposed to be

524
00:21:47,469 --> 00:21:51,689
tested and like, either ul, like underwriters laboratory listed or

525
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:55,239
most of them don't have that though.

526
00:21:55,369 --> 00:21:57,439
Well, uh, two problems. No,

527
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:59,319
number one, they will have it,

528
00:21:59,329 --> 00:22:02,130
but it will be self tested and certified by the manufacturer.

529
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,469
Not by a testing lab,

530
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:03,910
right?

531
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,709
Because they went to a, a self testing regime because it's a lot cheaper and faster.

532
00:22:07,949 --> 00:22:08,939
And, yeah, number two is,

533
00:22:08,949 --> 00:22:13,000
they just don't have any of those markings and it's just like buyer beware.

534
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:13,680
Good luck with that.

535
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:20,160
Yeah, I've, I had a bunch of power supplies for USB that had no markings and II,

536
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,239
I forget what happened.

537
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:26,430
One of them did something weird and I just, I've thrown them all away now

538
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,770
and I've given up and I purposely just buy things that I know I can trust because

539
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:36,569
my assumption is if it says UL on it, it's gone through some level of testing,

540
00:22:36,979 --> 00:22:38,979
assuming they just didn't put the markings on.

541
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,910
I'm assuming it went through some level of testing.

542
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:46,010
But again, you're right. I, I have no way to truly prove it.

543
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:46,790
Right.

544
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:47,510
Yeah.

545
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,880
And see, this is where I think some of the, you know,

546
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,310
some of the people have been talking about things like

547
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:56,160
Blockchain for supply chain management where you can actually trace like

548
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:59,339
that fish from the fish farm to your plate or

549
00:22:59,469 --> 00:23:01,930
that specific component from like

550
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,280
where it was made and what went into it to your end

551
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:07,160
thing.

552
00:23:07,489 --> 00:23:09,060
And I think longer term that will definitely

553
00:23:09,069 --> 00:23:10,800
happen for some of the more expensive stuff.

554
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:12,680
But yeah, for like a $1 cable. That's

555
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,189
-- right. Yeah, that's going to be tough.
-- Right. Exactly.

556
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,579
Exactly. And, and

557
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:23,530
man, you think about what goes into even a $1 cable, I mean, there's wire in it,

558
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,550
there's connectors in it.

559
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,989
There's the plastic, there's

560
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:27,239
that guy

561
00:23:27,349 --> 00:23:28,349
that made a toaster,

562
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:29,880
remember that guy that made a toaster,

563
00:23:30,329 --> 00:23:30,339
a

564
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,869
toaster? He didn't make a, he, he barely made a wire.

565
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:34,729
That's what he

566
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:34,949
did.

567
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:39,260
Well, technically he made something that toasted bread once and then caught fire,

568
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,459
whatever

569
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:41,680
anyway.

570
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,119
-- But
-- no, the point is it was basically impossible to build.

571
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:44,819
Right.

572
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:49,750
Right. But that doesn't see, at the same time, I think that's ridiculous.

573
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,819
Way to think about it. I mean,

574
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:55,150
we live in a society where people have different things. They do.

575
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:57,069
I don't grow my own food.

576
00:23:57,239 --> 00:23:57,790
Right.

577
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:58,719
You don't grow.

578
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,310
-- But
-- did you see the picture of the,

579
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:02,829
of the $4 toaster he bought and took apart and there was, like,

580
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:04,319
over 100 components in it.

581
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:08,219
I, right. Right. Because that's how

582
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:10,030
the modern society works.

583
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:11,099
Yeah.

584
00:24:13,479 --> 00:24:17,229
So, I guess the moral of the story is where, um,

585
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:21,359
he shielded gloves, like, so wear winter gloves whenever you're typing passwords.

586
00:24:21,369 --> 00:24:23,979
No, don't do that. That's ridiculous.

587
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:28,290
Look, here's what, here's what the moral of the story is. The moral of the story is.

588
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,969
We are surrounded by risk every day

589
00:24:31,189 --> 00:24:34,140
and we have to make decisions about where we want to put,

590
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,280
invest our risk dollars and where not to

591
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,420
worrying about the heat signature on your keyboard.

592
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,020
If someone wants to attack you on that level, they're going to get you no matter what.

593
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:46,619
That's just one of the possible ways they can get in.

594
00:24:46,989 --> 00:24:47,500
Right.

595
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:50,660
And so the reality is if that's the risk you're worried about,

596
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:54,699
you better be like some spy in a hostile foreign nation

597
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,380
because if you're not, you're probably wasting your resources.

598
00:25:00,109 --> 00:25:01,619
This is where, like, two factor

599
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:01,760
a

600
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,530
solves this problem 100%.

601
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:05,290
Right.

602
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,000
And

603
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:07,010
not on two factor

604
00:25:07,229 --> 00:25:07,250
off.

605
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,300
I was glancing through the user list in a slack,

606
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,609
uh, that we'd set up

607
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,430
and I noticed one of them had next to their name.

608
00:25:14,439 --> 00:25:17,829
Two fa enabled and I was like, oh, Slack Sports two fa, I didn't even know that.

609
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,569
So I went and enabled it on my account. But

610
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:24,239
yeah, that just goes to show even me with my whole, oh, use two fa everybody used to fa,

611
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:24,290
I,

612
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,099
I still don't because honestly half the time I'm not

613
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,780
even aware it's supported in some of these newer services.

614
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:32,339
I, I had no idea I could do that either

615
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:35,599
and I blame Slack for not forcing us to use it.

616
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:36,750
I would agree.

617
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,140
-- I mean, for real, they
-- appear to have that switch.

618
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,260
You can flip to like force two fa across the org.

619
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:42,810
Oh, nice,

620
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:44,189
nice, nice.

621
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,430
But um,

622
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:46,349
yeah,

623
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:51,130
even you and I are guilty of not taking simple steps that are extremely easy and

624
00:25:51,439 --> 00:25:52,319
extremely.

625
00:25:52,989 --> 00:25:55,979
Ok. No, we don't want to say guilty because

626
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:00,239
now that I know a Slack allows two factor off, I'm going to go enable it.

627
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,739
Like, as soon as we stop talking,

628
00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:05,589
I didn't know about this before. So you can't say I'm guilty. Right.

629
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:06,589
Then that's, I mean,

630
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,939
in all seriousness this,

631
00:26:09,939 --> 00:26:11,890
we should probably we could stand to do.

632
00:26:12,199 --> 00:26:16,359
I would say part of it is we have the expectation that there isn't always two fa like,

633
00:26:16,369 --> 00:26:18,199
and that's the fault of all these companies

634
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,520
because they should have supported this sooner.

635
00:26:20,989 --> 00:26:21,040
No,

636
00:26:21,339 --> 00:26:24,699
no, it's not about that. It's about the words we use right?

637
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:26,760
When you tell someone they're guilty of not doing it,

638
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:28,510
you're now placing the blame on them

639
00:26:28,699 --> 00:26:34,150
or, or like, for example, I, I had someone I know the other day said if you can use git,

640
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,540
you can use GP G

641
00:26:36,189 --> 00:26:36,859
and I

642
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:37,420
understand,

643
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:38,229
I know.

644
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:41,199
Well, that's another story but I understand the intention of saying that,

645
00:26:41,209 --> 00:26:44,280
that it is complicated and you're a smart person if you're using it.

646
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:46,359
So you should be smart enough to set up GP G

647
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:47,609
and he's not wrong.

648
00:26:47,619 --> 00:26:50,469
But what he actually said was if you don't know how GP G works, you're dumb.

649
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,130
Right?

650
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:55,170
And it's, I think this is something I'm becoming really sensitive to insecurity is

651
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:58,969
we're really good at saying things that, that don't have ill intent

652
00:26:59,329 --> 00:27:03,489
but to a, a number of humans who hear our words,

653
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,599
they realize we're effectively

654
00:27:06,739 --> 00:27:07,770
demeaning them,

655
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:12,209
not on purpose, but we are. And that's a huge problem for this industry.

656
00:27:12,219 --> 00:27:14,780
But we won't, we don't need to get into that today because

657
00:27:14,959 --> 00:27:15,150
that's

658
00:27:15,609 --> 00:27:15,619
a,

659
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:16,030
that's

660
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:16,560
true because

661
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:17,930
there's similar, you know,

662
00:27:17,939 --> 00:27:21,800
the similar thing with like car mechanics talking down to people or whatever.

663
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:22,000
Right.

664
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:25,319
And when you find a car mechanic that doesn't talk down to you, you tend to keep them,

665
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,959
-- you know. Yeah,
-- exactly. That's exactly right.

666
00:27:28,969 --> 00:27:32,589
And it's the same deal with security and I just, I keep thinking about there,

667
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:36,729
there's all these parallels and all these analogies and

668
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:42,640
this, these problems exist in almost every other industry as well.

669
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:45,170
And so I, I often wonder,

670
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:49,430
will we, will it ever get better? And I have a feeling the answer is no,

671
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:52,680
I, I'm more hopeful because II I am seeing across the industry,

672
00:27:52,689 --> 00:27:53,969
I think people are beginning to,

673
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:57,310
to become more aware of the fact that security is not just a technical problem,

674
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:59,530
it's a people problem, it's a social problem.

675
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:01,560
Yeah. There, there is some of that.

676
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,969
Well, there's that famous quote, you know, you can't solve social problems

677
00:28:05,089 --> 00:28:07,719
very well with technology and, and I think it goes the other way,

678
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:11,000
speaking down to these people, yeah, that definitely will not help.

679
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,810
And I think there's an awareness that we,

680
00:28:12,819 --> 00:28:15,300
we need to work with these people and not just bully them

681
00:28:15,739 --> 00:28:17,699
and, and part of it is I love the cloud for that, right?

682
00:28:17,709 --> 00:28:20,800
Because you, you can't bully users anymore because they're like, fine.

683
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:22,920
I'm going over to this service. That doesn't sound right.

684
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,479
Exactly. Exactly.
