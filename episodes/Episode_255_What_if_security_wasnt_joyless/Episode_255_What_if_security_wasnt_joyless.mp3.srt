Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt Siefried

1
00:00:09,739 --> 00:00:11,529
and my partner in cleaning. Josh

2
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,340
Pressers. Cleaning your

3
00:00:13,449 --> 00:00:13,510
last

4
00:00:13,729 --> 00:00:13,840
name.

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,119
-- I do have a
-- last name.

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,549
-- I sort of zoned out there for a sec. I was just like
-- Josh,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,430
I need. Hold

8
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,750
on. I gotta shut my closet door here.

9
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,829
You know what? That's the wrong intro. It's my partner in tidying.

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,620
Tidying and cleaning are two very different things.

11
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:25,670
So,

12
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,950
you know, I recorded my closet and it's really freaking cold today.

13
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,479
-- It's, oh man, it's like
-- freezing

14
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:31,829
cold

15
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,000
or cold in your house.

16
00:00:33,279 --> 00:00:35,630
Well, both. I mean, I own an old house. So,

17
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:36,909
-- ok, because
-- I'm like,

18
00:00:37,459 --> 00:00:40,360
there's a certain amount of air that always leaks in. But anyway,

19
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:41,700
you're going to hear me

20
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:43,330
by the end of this, I think.

21
00:00:43,459 --> 00:00:47,450
No, I've removed all the squirrels from my house. It was an effort and it's ongoing.

22
00:00:47,459 --> 00:00:49,529
I have to, I have to keep all the trees trimmed back

23
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:53,250
so they can't get on the roof. But anyway, whatever, what are we talking about today?

24
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:55,290
Well, first of all, tidying,

25
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:58,000
not cleaning, cleaning and tidying are two different things.

26
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:00,200
That's one of the things I had to learn from Marie Kondo.

27
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,439
I'm not gonna argue

28
00:01:02,669 --> 00:01:03,419
with you about it.

29
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,660
So, real quick cleaning is

30
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:11,919
to me, it's like sanitizing and wiping and you know, you can have an untidy,

31
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:14,980
like a cluttered environment that is, you know, it's been like

32
00:01:15,574 --> 00:01:16,574
or bleach down,

33
00:01:16,824 --> 00:01:22,574
I would define my office is that environment where there is lots of junk and,

34
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:24,095
but it is very clean

35
00:01:24,205 --> 00:01:28,455
and then conversely, you can have tidy but unsanitary unclean, you know,

36
00:01:28,544 --> 00:01:29,864
you can have somebody who lives in a

37
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:32,095
very minimalist home and has never cleaned their toilet

38
00:01:32,305 --> 00:01:32,934
that

39
00:01:33,105 --> 00:01:34,165
terrifies me.

40
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,500
So

41
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,099
we're going to be talking, not,

42
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,680
not about cleaning and I apologize for that intro but about tidying.

43
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:41,180
And so

44
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,589
Josh wouldn't let me mention this one style of cleaning that I like.

45
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:48,379
So we're going to go with the happier one. Marie Kondo's, does it spark joy?

46
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:51,389
I'm gonna, I'm gonna rat you up first. There's what is it called?

47
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,459
-- Like Swedish death cleaning or something? Swedish
-- death cleaning.

48
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,069
The idea,

49
00:01:55,339 --> 00:01:55,720
you know,

50
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,339
clean up after yourself. So you're next of kin, don't have to.

51
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:01,150
That is not a topic I have any interest to talk

52
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,400
about and there's enough angst in the world right now.

53
00:02:03,669 --> 00:02:07,339
-- So we're going to talk about happy things.
-- Marie Kondo's, does it spark joy?

54
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:11,690
And, and, and what I love about Marie Kondo's method is it basically boils down to,

55
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:14,619
it's very simple in your personal life, you know,

56
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,210
does this object, does this thing,

57
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:20,660
you know, a pair of pants or whatever? Does it spark joy?

58
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:23,580
And she literally says, look, just pick it up and, and

59
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:26,580
feel how your body feels about it. And to quote,

60
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,179
does it feel as if every part or cell of your body lifts up or

61
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,539
does it feel as if every part of your body feels like it weighs down?

62
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:36,360
If I was to pick you up, you'd be very heavy.

63
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:37,869
And,

64
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,539
and what I also love about her method of tidying is it's not just the practical stuff,

65
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:41,720
right?

66
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:43,419
Like, for example, I have a bunch of stuff.

67
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:46,589
I only use half the year and I have to keep it or I will buy like,

68
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,389
my snow boots and my snow pants.

69
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:49,429
Right? Like,

70
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,869
nor do they bring me joy because it's winter.

71
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,270
Well, they do bring me joy when I wear them outside and it's minus 30 my feet are warm.

72
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,979
Yeah, that, that's probably fair.

73
00:02:57,429 --> 00:03:00,699
The thing I've always hated about these tidying systems or methods is

74
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:03,649
ok. There's like this continuum of like one.

75
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,789
You absolutely have to have it like a drawer of underwear and socks.

76
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,410
You, everybody has to have that.

77
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:09,639
You need

78
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:09,990
three

79
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:10,929
pairs of socks.

80
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,250
Yeah.

81
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:15,369
And then there's all the way to zero where obviously this is

82
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,910
like a piece of junk that was given to you that you

83
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,589
hate and you're allergic to and you just keep it in a

84
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,690
sealed box and just can't bring yourself to throw it out.

85
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:21,309
But you should.

86
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:24,710
But all the stuff in the middle where, ok, there's that continuum of like,

87
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,369
ok, well,

88
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,100
my winter gear I need because half the year I need to not die when I go outside,

89
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,520
you know, my swimsuits.

90
00:03:30,529 --> 00:03:32,860
Well, yeah, in summer I need my swimsuit because, you know,

91
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:34,949
we go to the spray parks or the pool or whatever.

92
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,889
But what about that stuff?

93
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:38,009
So perfect example here is I have like an old

94
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,190
Nintendo wii still works because that Nintendo build quality.

95
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:41,399
-- Did
-- you

96
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:45,479
-- hack that thing? Hack. That thing, man, I
-- meant to but never got around to

97
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:45,690
it.

98
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,270
They're hacked. They're so good.

99
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,029
So what, I'm still not going to play it.

100
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,009
It's been sitting in a box for, I don't know,

101
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,610
over a decade and I realized I'm hanging on to it because I paid for it and it works.

102
00:03:54,619 --> 00:03:57,190
Right? And so it doesn't really spark joy. I never play with it.

103
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,600
It's just sort of one more thing to keep on a shelf. This is a security podcast.

104
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:01,339
I'm

105
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,029
going to get to the, so a great example is I own a pair of really nice later Hosen,

106
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:05,179
right?

107
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,250
They're black with flower pattern. They're really nice

108
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,240
and they, I mean, I only wear them once a year at most, you know,

109
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,710
to like whatever local beer festival, right?

110
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,600
And then I get to make fun of the people wearing all the crappy fake later. Hosen.

111
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,980
-- Yeah. No, it's,
-- come

112
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,899
on, you're a later

113
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:19,600
snob.

114
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:21,358
Yes.

115
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,279
Yes, I am

116
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,929
100%.

117
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:25,769
And so

118
00:04:25,989 --> 00:04:28,730
that's what I like about the Spark joy method is that it gives

119
00:04:28,739 --> 00:04:34,329
you this excuse to keep stuff that maybe isn't practical or terribly useful.

120
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:38,089
But, you know, it does bring you joy. And so I was thinking about this in it terms

121
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,769
so perfect example in it, in terms back in the day at this,

122
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:41,950
at the Cloud Security alliance,

123
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,660
we had a mailing list server

124
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,959
because we had mailing list.

125
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,519
And so I had a machine running mailman and I had two postfix

126
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:50,320
servers in front of it and two post six postfix servers behind it,

127
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,029
you know, for incoming email and for outgoing email and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

128
00:04:53,269 --> 00:04:55,679
and did it spark joy. No, it sparked dread.

129
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,279
It was a nightmare to manage, you know, the anti spam,

130
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,130
the

131
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:04,809
uh all the stuff associated with running email manually by yourself nowadays.

132
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,130
And I realized no, like marketing,

133
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,649
you guys like mailchimp good. You're on mailchimp now,

134
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:10,230
right?

135
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:11,779
You've got all the mailchimp stuff,

136
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,059
all the A B testing and it sparks joy because literally all I had to do was log in,

137
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,649
create some accounts dump in a giant CS V of names and emails and,

138
00:05:19,929 --> 00:05:20,529
and that's it,

139
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,309
right.

140
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,290
It, there's no more stress and dread and I got to turn off all those five servers.

141
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:27,010
It was lovely. So I was thinking about this in terms of it, right.

142
00:05:27,115 --> 00:05:29,085
In terms of personal stuff, there's the stuff you need.

143
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:31,746
So, like you have clothes to wear outside

144
00:05:31,936 --> 00:05:33,096
all the way down to that, you know,

145
00:05:33,105 --> 00:05:34,976
stuff you don't want or need that was given to

146
00:05:34,985 --> 00:05:36,735
you by somebody else you didn't even pay for it.

147
00:05:36,955 --> 00:05:38,795
And in it terms, there's,

148
00:05:38,946 --> 00:05:44,656
in theory, every single sort of it thing is necessary otherwise, why is it on?

149
00:05:44,665 --> 00:05:45,816
Really? Right.

150
00:05:45,825 --> 00:05:50,816
-- Like every it system in theory should be used to some degree
-- it should be.

151
00:05:50,865 --> 00:05:55,335
-- And I think that's a really interesting point.
-- So I was thinking about this

152
00:05:56,062 --> 00:06:00,002
of sort of from 0 to 1, like for example, at the CS A on on the one side

153
00:06:00,212 --> 00:06:03,761
payroll, right? I think we can all agree payroll is important.

154
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,481
-- People need to get paid,
-- right? Or, or like email, right?

155
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:11,171
-- You can't exist without email.
-- Email was going to be next followed by the website.

156
00:06:11,182 --> 00:06:11,701
Yeah.

157
00:06:11,821 --> 00:06:12,261
Yeah.

158
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:14,872
So these are things we can clearly all agree that like

159
00:06:15,122 --> 00:06:18,872
need to be kept up and running. So the CS A can just function,

160
00:06:19,111 --> 00:06:24,212
right? That these are not at all optional and then all the way at sort of maybe zero.

161
00:06:24,489 --> 00:06:25,589
Uh Well, perfect example,

162
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,989
we were using box.com back in the day because they had time expiring links which

163
00:06:29,109 --> 00:06:31,029
Google and other people didn't have. Right.

164
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,630
And so that's actually quite a handy feature because you can share a link out and not

165
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,709
have to worry about it kind of biting you in the ass in five years from now.

166
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,230
And so

167
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:44,109
I think in terms of it, does it spark joy is essentially, does this service?

168
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,630
Well, step one is, do you need this service?

169
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:51,279
Right? Because there are sometimes just things that you can just get rid of.

170
00:06:51,549 --> 00:06:55,279
I want to reframe this even more than that. And let's talk about security.

171
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,160
Well, and that's where I'm getting to. Stage two

172
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,899
is seven minutes in.

173
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:03,690
So, but stage two is, for example, do you need what this thing does?

174
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,859
And maybe not in its current incarnation.

175
00:07:05,869 --> 00:07:10,072
So for example, with the mailing list stuff, we needed mailing list 100% to them.

176
00:07:10,192 --> 00:07:12,263
But you know what, we don't need to run them ourselves.

177
00:07:12,273 --> 00:07:12,713
That's, you know,

178
00:07:12,722 --> 00:07:16,192
we can use mailchimp and so we outsourced it to mailchimp and life was better.

179
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:18,653
And then in security terms, there's, yeah,

180
00:07:18,662 --> 00:07:19,963
there's all those security things around it.

181
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:20,653
For example,

182
00:07:20,662 --> 00:07:23,342
I love Google because I can just enable

183
00:07:23,352 --> 00:07:25,592
and force everybody to use two factor authentication.

184
00:07:25,602 --> 00:07:27,192
Good luck breaking into accounts.

185
00:07:27,203 --> 00:07:30,872
-- So,
-- you know what immediately comes to mind here when you, when you bring the

186
00:07:31,165 --> 00:07:36,226
is in the world of security right now, I think we're at this

187
00:07:36,436 --> 00:07:38,265
point of disruption where there's all these

188
00:07:38,276 --> 00:07:41,205
automated tools starting to emerge and there are

189
00:07:41,406 --> 00:07:46,085
a lot of them are comically bad to the point of like I'll use as an easy example, like,

190
00:07:46,096 --> 00:07:49,506
let's say you have a SIM, which is, you know, a security, you know,

191
00:07:49,515 --> 00:07:52,246
event manager basically where you bring in all this.

192
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:53,220
Yeah,

193
00:07:53,489 --> 00:07:55,799
but you bring in all this, all this information, right?

194
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,299
And then you somehow process it and you have to deal

195
00:07:58,309 --> 00:08:00,579
with it and there's always this talk of like alert fatigue

196
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:04,470
and, and I would bet you in a nontrivial number of organizations,

197
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,500
if you just literally turn the sim off,

198
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,980
it would make a lot of people's lives better and it would make no difference.

199
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:14,660
And if that's true of any of your security infrastructure, like holy cow,

200
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,779
what's the deal?

201
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,440
But conversely, there's like,

202
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,200
I'm going to pick on Home Depot here because I specifically remember remember Home

203
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,901
Depot was explicitly warned by their not their sin but their security firm saying,

204
00:08:23,911 --> 00:08:25,881
look, you've got some bad stuff going on in here,

205
00:08:26,031 --> 00:08:26,960
you need to deal with this.

206
00:08:26,971 --> 00:08:29,420
And you know, of course it turns out and I was one of those, you know,

207
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,920
I got that notice saying, you know,

208
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,370
Home Depot got hacked and you bought stuff at Home Depot.

209
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,160
So like maybe think about getting a new credit card because we're

210
00:08:36,171 --> 00:08:39,400
not really sure how much data went missing or whatever really happened.

211
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,801
And I think part of it too is again on that

212
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,260
0 to 1 scale,

213
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,041
-- I can't run a 24 7 knock.
-- Well, you can't,

214
00:08:46,471 --> 00:08:48,971
but it depends what your environment or like I mean,

215
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:53,052
a SIM is my favorite example just because, like, there are SIMS that are really good

216
00:08:53,192 --> 00:08:56,062
and it's partially good technology and it's partially good people.

217
00:08:56,151 --> 00:09:01,781
-- And then there are SIMS that are just money fires that don't do anything.
-- It's worse.

218
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,382
-- It's not that they don't do anything. It's that they actively make your life
-- worse.

219
00:09:05,392 --> 00:09:07,221
They're negative value. Right.

220
00:09:07,392 --> 00:09:09,622
Yeah. There, there are too many false alerts

221
00:09:09,752 --> 00:09:12,211
and, yeah, it's, it's actively making your life worse.

222
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:15,482
It's active eating up your time and money and attention

223
00:09:15,492 --> 00:09:17,872
and taking you away from what you should be doing.

224
00:09:17,882 --> 00:09:18,002
Right.

225
00:09:18,013 --> 00:09:20,122
There was that tweet talking about to avoid solar winds, you know,

226
00:09:20,132 --> 00:09:23,033
what would you tell your CEO or CISO or whatever the heck to do?

227
00:09:23,043 --> 00:09:25,773
And I'm like basic inventory and software hygiene.

228
00:09:25,783 --> 00:09:28,763
Like if you can't do that, everything else is the cart before the horse.

229
00:09:28,773 --> 00:09:33,723
Well, but even even that I don't think is clearly defined in many instances.

230
00:09:34,232 --> 00:09:39,362
This is one of the issues I think is there's a certain amount of missing

231
00:09:39,443 --> 00:09:43,044
standardization and rigor in security where there's still

232
00:09:43,054 --> 00:09:44,854
a lot of just made up crap.

233
00:09:44,864 --> 00:09:46,424
Well, a perfect example at the CS A,

234
00:09:46,434 --> 00:09:50,383
we just went through our annual exercise of who's all our vendors.

235
00:09:50,393 --> 00:09:53,874
And we're lucky in that because we're 100% cloud based,

236
00:09:53,934 --> 00:09:55,864
everything shows up on corporate credit cards.

237
00:09:55,874 --> 00:09:57,643
And so we basically get corporate credit card

238
00:09:57,653 --> 00:10:00,544
statements from accounting who actually has a spreadsheet

239
00:10:00,554 --> 00:10:04,213
with all that data and we're able to go through and we're literally finding vendors.

240
00:10:04,343 --> 00:10:07,044
Some, it's, you know, obviously somebody's signed up for like

241
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:11,044
some little lucid chart thing or whatever, for 30 bucks, whatever. No big deal.

242
00:10:11,054 --> 00:10:13,125
But then there's other things where it's kind of like, whoa, you know,

243
00:10:13,135 --> 00:10:15,164
we have this recurring monthly thing from this.

244
00:10:15,335 --> 00:10:16,544
-- Who are these people?
-- Yeah.

245
00:10:16,554 --> 00:10:20,784
But now at, at the same time, if you're a fortune 100 company,

246
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:24,284
your vendors are everyone else.

247
00:10:24,614 --> 00:10:27,565
Well, and also it's not as clearly defined as to what they do, right?

248
00:10:27,575 --> 00:10:29,885
With a cloud service, you go to their website, you can read what they do.

249
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,645
But when you have $100,000 bill from Dell,

250
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,729
like, what is that? Is that a, is that a cluster of windows 95

251
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:38,059
machine,

252
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,960
something fine, just pay the bill.

253
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,270
But I mean, you know, what's it running? Right? It's probably a pile of,

254
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:45,390
you know, or, or even worse.

255
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,719
You have a bill for 100,000 from Dell and 50,000 from Microsoft.

256
00:10:48,729 --> 00:10:49,960
Like what's on your network?

257
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:50,919
Everything?

258
00:10:51,369 --> 00:10:51,679
Yeah.

259
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:52,700
And so

260
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,369
this Marie Kondo Spark Joy Method. I,

261
00:10:56,099 --> 00:10:58,919
it really, you know, I actually went through, you know, we,

262
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:00,280
we're currently going through the spreadsheet.

263
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:03,840
We're also updating from a GDPR perspective of what, you know,

264
00:11:03,849 --> 00:11:07,789
do these vendors have any pi I from external people, blah, blah, blah, all that,

265
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,010
you know, is it self serve?

266
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,049
Do we have to remove it? You know, all this stuff and,

267
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:14,080
and it's really liberating because some of these, you know, we're like,

268
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,059
what is this?

269
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,919
Oh, you know what marketing uses that and really relies on it. Oh, ok. Cool.

270
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:19,479
Like they're on top of it. Good, you know.

271
00:11:19,489 --> 00:11:22,000
But on the other hand, there's a few older things in here where it's just like,

272
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,719
what is this and why do we have it?

273
00:11:23,729 --> 00:11:23,960
And

274
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,030
nobody seems to know what it is.

275
00:11:26,229 --> 00:11:29,010
So let's figure out how to stop paying for that.

276
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:29,260
I,

277
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:34,380
I think that's the story and I see this in the security world all the time where people

278
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:37,289
have tools or infrastructure or something and you don't

279
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:39,130
even know why you still have it anymore.

280
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:40,729
And I mean,

281
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,260
it

282
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,000
honestly, in

283
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:44,369
my basement,

284
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:47,869
I have a closet that's full of boxes of stuff.

285
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,840
I literally could not tell you what's in them

286
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,770
and I have a suspicion that means I should probably just throw them all away.

287
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:57,849
I realized at one point I had boxes that I had packed for moving three houses ago.

288
00:11:58,099 --> 00:12:00,469
I, I, yeah, I, I believe that.

289
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:02,390
And so I actually forced myself to go through all the

290
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,549
boxes and number one get rid of the obvious crap.

291
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:05,820
And you know,

292
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,539
and well, and for example, does it spark joy? Right? Like there's, I have this big,

293
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,960
you know, uh 2.5 inch cub

294
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,780
chunk of concrete here next to my desk, you know, it's a piece of the Berlin Wall?

295
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:16,729
-- Oh,
-- that's cool.

296
00:12:16,849 --> 00:12:20,549
Is it a practical, useful thing? No, it's a chunk of concrete.

297
00:12:21,385 --> 00:12:24,655
-- Does it have graffiti on it? No, no, no,
-- it's, it's just like an internal piece. It's,

298
00:12:25,294 --> 00:12:28,455
it's one of the few times they actually spent money on making good concrete.

299
00:12:28,585 --> 00:12:29,294
Sadly.

300
00:12:29,484 --> 00:12:31,575
And so, you know, I force and that's,

301
00:12:31,594 --> 00:12:33,804
I think that's part of step one is just forcing yourself to

302
00:12:33,815 --> 00:12:36,315
go through these boxes or forcing yourself to go through these systems

303
00:12:36,494 --> 00:12:36,965
and just

304
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,419
label and find out what you have

305
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:42,530
and, and some stuff will be just super easy to get rid of. Like

306
00:12:42,859 --> 00:12:47,450
I had a box with like 20 bucks worth of change rattling around at the bottom of it.

307
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:51,020
-- So I scooped it up into a jar and took it to the
-- bank. That's cash money right there.

308
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,700
Yeah, exactly.

309
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,659
Like why, why was I keeping $20 and change in a box?

310
00:12:54,669 --> 00:12:58,390
This is why I love when I'm traveling abroad and

311
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,710
I get to the airport and they have like a,

312
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:03,140
basically a bucket that's like, please put your change in here for, you know,

313
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:03,919
charity or whatever.

314
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:07,419
I'm like, oh, thank goodness. And I just like dump piles of it in.

315
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:12,080
-- So
-- I think doing that basic inventory and, and just labeling what you have and,

316
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:15,549
and you will get rid of some easy stuff that zero stuff, that stuff where you're like,

317
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,359
why do I have a moldy cup of coffee in a box,

318
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:22,150
-- right. That may or may not be a true story. I'm going
-- to complain. I need to just,

319
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:23,549
you know, whinge a little bit.

320
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:28,520
And so my Children are notorious for taking a drink into the basement

321
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,039
and then putting it in a weird place and then

322
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:33,150
we find it like a month later and it's like,

323
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:34,000
oh, my goodness,

324
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,780
you're going to clean this because I'm not touching it and it's

325
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:40,080
just like a science experiment and the grossest thing in the world.

326
00:13:40,155 --> 00:13:42,955
Yeah, I have a rule. Only water bottles in the basement.

327
00:13:42,965 --> 00:13:46,015
Like the kind that, like seal, like sports water bottles.

328
00:13:46,315 --> 00:13:48,455
Yeah, nothing else is allowed food wise in the basement.

329
00:13:48,465 --> 00:13:53,455
I, I try to have this rule but I'm disregarded. Obviously.

330
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,934
I've been viciously enforcing it since my Children were

331
00:13:57,244 --> 00:13:57,804
born.

332
00:13:57,815 --> 00:14:01,885
-- So,
-- no, like, look, ok, so this is, let's, I want to expand on this topic and use it.

333
00:14:01,895 --> 00:14:04,375
Use it as a launching point because so here's the thing, right?

334
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:07,690
My kids take a glass of something into the basement.

335
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:09,349
They leave it there

336
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,599
and there's minimal repercussions.

337
00:14:11,609 --> 00:14:13,609
I make them clean up after themselves, obviously.

338
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,989
But like, what am I really going to do now? As a security team?

339
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,780
You can tell people, oh, I would like you to keep your service updated.

340
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:21,770
And if they don't,

341
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,950
and if the payroll department says we can't update this because we can't pay people,

342
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,929
there's really nothing you can do and there aren't going to be any repercussions

343
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,669
I went more with, here's what you are allowed to do and encouraged to do.

344
00:14:33,905 --> 00:14:39,135
You are allowed to have drinks on the kitchen slash dining room slash family level.

345
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:41,325
It's a four level split. You are allowed

346
00:14:41,474 --> 00:14:43,505
to bring your drinks into the third level down here

347
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,255
into this work room because it is a concrete floor.

348
00:14:45,265 --> 00:14:47,955
So I don't care what you spill on the floor because it'll be easy to clean.

349
00:14:47,965 --> 00:14:50,924
It's that simple and you're not allowed to bring drinks downstairs

350
00:14:50,934 --> 00:14:53,125
because we have those like two by 2 ft rubber,

351
00:14:53,304 --> 00:14:54,885
uh, interlocking, you know,

352
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:58,025
mats that they have like gyms and if you spill a drink on them,

353
00:14:58,034 --> 00:15:00,054
I have to peel up all the rubber mats and clean under them.

354
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:00,655
Sure.

355
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:01,325
But

356
00:15:01,474 --> 00:15:02,905
they're not, that's not payroll.

357
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,460
Well, no, no, no.

358
00:15:04,469 --> 00:15:06,859
But so I've encouraged, like, you want to have your drink,

359
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:08,520
put it at the top of the stairs, right.

360
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:09,539
So I've given them

361
00:15:09,739 --> 00:15:12,380
ways to, to have their cake and eat it.

362
00:15:12,489 --> 00:15:14,820
Your house sounds like an awesome place.

363
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:19,130
-- So, I tried, we have swings in the basement and all sorts of fun stuff.
-- That's

364
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:22,330
-- cool.
-- Yeah. Well, winters here are long and cold. That,

365
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,940
that is true. You're, you're

366
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:28,059
no more north than I am by a lot and I think winters here are pretty terrible.

367
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,780
I agree because, yeah, you can't,

368
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:32,257
oh, you know, payroll, you have to win all this patch.

369
00:15:32,268 --> 00:15:34,247
And I don't care if it breaks payroll or not. Yes. Yes.

370
00:15:34,348 --> 00:15:35,408
When I worked for that,

371
00:15:36,288 --> 00:15:39,507
well, I worked for this electrical contractor company that, you know, had 5,

372
00:15:39,518 --> 00:15:40,687
600 electricians on staff.

373
00:15:40,697 --> 00:15:43,078
They did industrial stuff and came time to

374
00:15:43,088 --> 00:15:45,797
upgrade the payroll machine and they're like,

375
00:15:45,807 --> 00:15:47,578
Kurt, you know, can you build a cheap machine to host it?

376
00:15:47,588 --> 00:15:51,817
And I'm like, no, because I don't want 500 angry electricians knowing where I park

377
00:15:52,468 --> 00:15:54,138
on Friday at 6 p.m.

378
00:15:54,908 --> 00:15:56,208
You know, I'm like, we,

379
00:15:56,218 --> 00:15:59,348
the payroll company will sell us this vastly overpriced

380
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:02,036
5000 dollar machine and you'll pay for it because

381
00:16:02,216 --> 00:16:06,976
-- payroll for 500 electricians,
-- I mean, so, so in all seriousness, you know,

382
00:16:06,986 --> 00:16:11,356
kind of tying this all together now is there's this concept of things will say,

383
00:16:11,366 --> 00:16:12,445
bring you joy,

384
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:16,716
but I think it's not even just bring you joy because in the world of security and it,

385
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,815
there's like things you actually need,

386
00:16:18,825 --> 00:16:21,765
whether it gives you joy because we all have infrastructure that like we

387
00:16:21,776 --> 00:16:24,895
freaking hate and we would burn it in fire if we could.

388
00:16:24,926 --> 00:16:28,114
-- But replace it with what? Well, and
-- that's just it. You have to have it.

389
00:16:28,124 --> 00:16:30,174
You can't get rid of it. You know what I mean?

390
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:33,364
It doesn't bring me joy, but it has to be there.

391
00:16:33,523 --> 00:16:36,244
There's a lot of it stuff that yes, I would love to get rid of it,

392
00:16:36,414 --> 00:16:40,783
but what it provides, we absolutely need to function so in that way that

393
00:16:41,023 --> 00:16:45,093
the whole sparking joy isn't just sparking joy and happiness.

394
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,893
But it can also be, you know, from a practical standpoint.

395
00:16:47,903 --> 00:16:50,414
Does this thing, for example, prevent you from being dead?

396
00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:54,814
You know, I'm guessing a lot of people who are dependent on insulin injections

397
00:16:54,953 --> 00:16:55,573
aren't

398
00:16:55,752 --> 00:16:59,831
super happy fun times about jabbing themselves with a needle once or twice a day.

399
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:03,291
Probably not super fun. But does it prevent them from being dead?

400
00:17:03,521 --> 00:17:04,332
Yeah. And

401
00:17:04,462 --> 00:17:08,411
that's ok. But that's not the worst thing in the world. That's fair. That's fair.

402
00:17:08,421 --> 00:17:10,751
And that's how I feel about a lot of it. Infrastructure like,

403
00:17:10,901 --> 00:17:11,511
yeah, I,

404
00:17:11,732 --> 00:17:15,411
no, I don't like maintaining X but, well, if we don't have X,

405
00:17:15,421 --> 00:17:17,301
we don't have a company or whatever.

406
00:17:17,631 --> 00:17:18,432
So I wanna,

407
00:17:18,442 --> 00:17:20,811
I wanna kind of for the last little bit of time

408
00:17:20,821 --> 00:17:23,332
we have here is so I think there's two extremes,

409
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:26,209
there's things you need and we'll say spark joy.

410
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:30,689
Right. There's the things you hate and can probably get rid of and probably should.

411
00:17:30,699 --> 00:17:35,369
But there's this whole thing in the middle where there's this like sliding scale of,

412
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,270
we probably need this to.

413
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,209
Maybe we don't, but I'm not exactly sure. And turning it off might get me fired.

414
00:17:41,219 --> 00:17:42,479
Can I give a perfect example?

415
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,680
Our Asia Pacific Office uses a little web hosting service.

416
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:47,530
It's like 23 bucks a month.

417
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,680
Toast uh website they do for, for having conferences and stuff.

418
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:55,209
And would I love to get rid of it and have one less thing to worry about.

419
00:17:55,349 --> 00:17:58,010
Absolutely. But you know what, for 23 bucks a month

420
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,609
and they update the site and they use the site.

421
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:01,599
Sure.

422
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:02,910
You guys do.

423
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:03,569
You, I mean,

424
00:18:03,739 --> 00:18:05,430
I think that's a no brainer then.

425
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,170
Like, but now let's say, let's say,

426
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,359
let's flip this around and say it was $23 a month.

427
00:18:11,609 --> 00:18:13,880
It's riddled with security holes

428
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,790
and it's probably a liability to you as the

429
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,989
director of it at the Cloud Security Alliance.

430
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,069
Now, what do you do?

431
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:23,170
Well, then we would look at transitioning it off on to something else.

432
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:28,030
But your people are saying like, no got to do this. No questions asked. Go away. Nerd.

433
00:18:28,219 --> 00:18:29,829
Well, then quite honestly,

434
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:30,989
I tweeted about this

435
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:34,224
would say you determine your risk appetite and that's what you eat for dinner.

436
00:18:34,234 --> 00:18:38,334
And so in that case, I would do an email chain saying here's the downsides,

437
00:18:38,344 --> 00:18:41,064
here's the upsides, here's the information about this.

438
00:18:41,074 --> 00:18:42,834
Here are your major options.

439
00:18:42,844 --> 00:18:45,314
If there's another clever option you can think of, please tell me.

440
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,064
But fundamentally if it boils down to,

441
00:18:47,074 --> 00:18:49,785
you want to use this insecure thing with this potential downside.

442
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,505
Ok.

443
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:53,199
You know what organizations get to do that

444
00:18:53,949 --> 00:18:58,319
except you're the one who has to clean up the mess.

445
00:18:58,489 --> 00:19:02,239
-- It gets potent. Yeah.
-- And that's why I, that's part of my job,

446
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:06,119
-- I guess. I mean,
-- do you think that school janitor likes cleaning up vomit.

447
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:06,869
No,

448
00:19:07,459 --> 00:19:09,020
I imagine that

449
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,400
that's part of the Cecil's job is to,

450
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,819
sometimes to eat that risk and maybe it doesn't turn out well,

451
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:18,640
and you're on the toilet at five AMI, guess that's part of the job.

452
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,349
And here's the thing that can happen,

453
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,307
even if you use the most secure thing in the world.

454
00:19:22,317 --> 00:19:22,687
Oh,

455
00:19:23,016 --> 00:19:24,437
well. Ok. No. No.

456
00:19:24,447 --> 00:19:26,546
So, I think this is where though,

457
00:19:26,557 --> 00:19:29,347
if you know it's insecure and you've kind of

458
00:19:29,357 --> 00:19:33,256
attempted to remedy the situation and you've been unsuccessful.

459
00:19:33,266 --> 00:19:36,286
-- Are
-- we going to put that scene from Fight Club in the, in the show notes?

460
00:19:36,296 --> 00:19:39,786
Which scene, the cost of a recall of A Times B times C? Then

461
00:19:40,187 --> 00:19:43,107
you know where he's telling this lady on the plane about what he does, right?

462
00:19:43,237 --> 00:19:45,546
No. Well, essentially that's how business works.

463
00:19:45,557 --> 00:19:46,107
We,

464
00:19:46,116 --> 00:19:51,374
we make a series of risk management decisions and sometimes we make the decision of,

465
00:19:51,384 --> 00:19:54,963
we will choose to allow this risky thing with a potential downside.

466
00:19:54,973 --> 00:19:55,374
And that's,

467
00:19:55,534 --> 00:19:57,484
-- that's it.
-- That's slightly different.

468
00:19:57,494 --> 00:20:00,573
So you're talking about the business as an amorphous blob.

469
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:04,203
But I'm thinking about once you go down a layer, you have these different groups.

470
00:20:04,213 --> 00:20:07,384
And an easy example is so you can have one group

471
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:08,303
that is like, oh,

472
00:20:08,313 --> 00:20:10,514
I totally accept this risk except they're not on

473
00:20:10,524 --> 00:20:12,793
the hook at all if something goes wrong.

474
00:20:12,803 --> 00:20:15,723
So like from their perspective, it's zero risk.

475
00:20:15,734 --> 00:20:17,973
But from my perspective, as a security guy,

476
00:20:18,144 --> 00:20:19,754
I get all the risk.

477
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,071
See,

478
00:20:20,081 --> 00:20:21,590
they're the problem you're talking about though is

479
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,211
that you have the responsibility but no accountability.

480
00:20:25,301 --> 00:20:28,480
And when you have responsibility and accountability, mismatch,

481
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:31,421
no matter what happens, you're up the creek, it's going to end poorly.

482
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:34,520
No matter what. If people are responsible for something

483
00:20:34,661 --> 00:20:37,191
-- that they cannot influence, they're
-- doomed.

484
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:41,120
I think accountability is a huge part of this, you know, joy or not joy.

485
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:46,740
I, I, I'd like this, this like number line in my head and on, on the left side is,

486
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,551
is joy and on the right side is not joy.

487
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,599
And I feel like if I'm responsible for something, but I, I'm,

488
00:20:53,609 --> 00:20:57,150
there's no accountability from the people, you know, who own it.

489
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,390
I feel like that automatically slides it like as far to the right as it can go,

490
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,109
you know, you make your risk appetite,

491
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:06,500
you make what is acceptable and not acceptable and, and if you can't

492
00:21:06,729 --> 00:21:08,989
force that, well, then you're up the creek like you don't,

493
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,630
this conversation doesn't matter because you have much more fundamental

494
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,589
problems to solve in your life and your work life,

495
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,150
if you're responsible for stuff that you can't exert any influence over,

496
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,630
well, you're gonna fail.

497
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,270
But anyways, if you can exert influence over, like I said, you know,

498
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,589
you do these email threads, you always put it down in writing,

499
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,349
in permanent writing,

500
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:31,189
you have this conversation and you ideally make a, a collaborative decision,

501
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:32,550
but it doesn't have to be collaborative.

502
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,729
You know, there's been cases where I'm like, honestly, I don't care, man,

503
00:21:34,739 --> 00:21:37,550
like just tell me what you want and I will build that for you,

504
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,239
you know, and you'll be in charge of it all the way up to.

505
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,020
I do deeply care because I have to manage this and it's a huge high risk thing.

506
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,479
So for example, we're using Google

507
00:21:45,619 --> 00:21:46,900
whatever it was called 10 years ago.

508
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,060
Now, it's I think Google Suite or something you keep renaming,

509
00:21:49,069 --> 00:21:50,119
I can't keep track of it,

510
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:54,229
you know, and, and it's like we're, we're firmly ensconced in Google. Now.

511
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:57,349
I would consider switching to Microsoft 365. It's actually pretty decent,

512
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:01,050
but the cost of switching is oh God, no, we're never doing that.

513
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,140
It's really high for sure. Every single document link breaks. Kurt.

514
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,969
What's your solution for that? My solution for that is I quit and hide. That's

515
00:22:07,199 --> 00:22:07,459
right. That's

516
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:07,750
right.

517
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:07,910
I,

518
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:10,630
I feel like this sparking joy because it not only

519
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,599
gives you a framework for sort of making a decision,

520
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,680
but a framework for being ok with that decision.

521
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:17,979
And I think,

522
00:22:18,089 --> 00:22:19,800
you know, that's one of the things I love and hate about democracy.

523
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:22,010
Democracy gives you a way to make decisions.

524
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,729
But in theory,

525
00:22:22,739 --> 00:22:24,079
it also gives you a way for the winners and

526
00:22:24,089 --> 00:22:26,569
the losers to be OK with that decision because I've,

527
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:28,040
I've done so many tidying

528
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,439
attempts before

529
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:32,640
where I felt bad after tidying like that.

530
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,760
I had to get rid of stuff I sort of still want

531
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,520
or I didn't get rid of stuff that I don't want.

532
00:22:37,699 --> 00:22:42,176
You know, and I didn't feel good about it whereas this sparking joy method, it's,

533
00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:43,615
well, if I don't want it, I don't want it.

534
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:46,906
And if I do want it I keep it and if I'm not sure in the middle deal with it next time,

535
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:50,745
maybe that there's a ton of vendors with the CS A where I just want to, you know,

536
00:22:50,755 --> 00:22:53,765
we've marked them in orange and it's kind of like we got to go deal with this, but,

537
00:22:53,776 --> 00:22:55,645
you know, not right now, we can do it later.

538
00:22:55,656 --> 00:23:01,635
-- And
-- that's fair. I think this is overly simplistic for a security team for sure.

539
00:23:01,645 --> 00:23:07,112
But I do think the one, the one part of this conversation I'm walking away with is, is

540
00:23:07,482 --> 00:23:08,832
accountability

541
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:10,491
is a huge part of everything.

542
00:23:10,501 --> 00:23:15,082
-- And I feel like a lot of security teams are accountable but they can
-- responsible,

543
00:23:15,092 --> 00:23:15,832
not accountable.

544
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:18,952
Right. They're responsible, but they're exactly. And so

545
00:23:19,161 --> 00:23:22,712
-- that's backwards.
-- So they're set up for failure, right.

546
00:23:22,722 --> 00:23:25,432
Failure is the only outcome of that because if the,

547
00:23:25,442 --> 00:23:27,881
if the people you're working with don't have to care,

548
00:23:27,891 --> 00:23:30,631
they just won't because it's not going to spark them joy.

549
00:23:30,802 --> 00:23:31,271
Right.

550
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,959
It's like, screw it. It doesn't bother me any.

551
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,010
And that's, that's just human nature.

552
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,280
It's like making me responsible for my neighbor's backyard.

553
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,890
But I'm not allowed to enter his property.

554
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,709
Right. What am I supposed to do?

555
00:23:42,829 --> 00:23:44,819
I don't even know how to process that.

556
00:23:44,829 --> 00:23:47,219
-- Well,
-- and then that's what happens with security teams though.

557
00:23:47,229 --> 00:23:48,040
Security team,

558
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,780
you are responsible for the security of the network and all systems on it.

559
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,640
Ok. Cool.

560
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,780
But you can't touch the payroll systems or hr systems. Right.

561
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:58,630
-- You can't even have a login,
-- oh, man, I love that so much when there's like a pen test.

562
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,430
And they're like, oh, all of this stuff is,

563
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,599
is off limits. It's out of scope.

564
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:07,739
And it's like, I don't, I don't think it works that or, you know what my favorite is.

565
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,359
So I've been, I was talking to a bug Bonnie Hunter the other day

566
00:24:11,609 --> 00:24:14,760
and they said they, they submitted a bug to a company and the company like, oh,

567
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,979
that system is supposed to be out of scope and then they

568
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:19,920
marked it out of scope and then they marked the bug invalid.

569
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:20,619
That's

570
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,109
ridiculous. That's awesome.

571
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:23,479
And,

572
00:24:23,619 --> 00:24:27,560
and then they were like, I will never report anything to these people again.

573
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,280
And I'm like, well, I mean, that's exactly what I would do

574
00:24:32,109 --> 00:24:33,579
anyway. It's,

575
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:36,250
this is, oh, man, you know, so you,

576
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,839
you said we were going to talk about this and I was thinking about it

577
00:24:38,849 --> 00:24:41,880
and this is not at all where the conversation went that I was expecting,

578
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:44,560
but it also really, oh, man, I'm really thinking about this now.

579
00:24:44,569 --> 00:24:48,550
It's just that whole responsible and accountability piece and, and insecurity.

580
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,739
It's just, do you remember working at Red Hat?

581
00:24:51,069 --> 00:24:51,550
-- I
-- mean,

582
00:24:52,439 --> 00:24:53,650
there was a lot of,

583
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:55,459
there was a lot of responsibility

584
00:24:55,469 --> 00:24:58,449
and accountability mismatches across the company.

585
00:24:58,619 --> 00:25:00,130
Yeah. There, there was.

586
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,140
And I mean, I, even now that we're talking about it, I see it now,

587
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:07,569
even there's some things that I'm responsible for now that like there's, and, and,

588
00:25:07,579 --> 00:25:11,170
and in fact, there's certain things I do that I feel like I fail

589
00:25:11,314 --> 00:25:14,755
on a regular basis and it's because I can't do anything about it.

590
00:25:14,765 --> 00:25:19,614
-- And, I mean, duh, now that you say it, it's so obvious.
-- Well, you know,

591
00:25:19,824 --> 00:25:22,805
I want my house not to fall down but Josh,

592
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:24,854
I don't want you messing with my house or touching it.

593
00:25:24,864 --> 00:25:26,785
-- Well,
-- that's fine because I live far away.

594
00:25:27,045 --> 00:25:27,224
Yeah.

595
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:31,415
Right. But, you know, now your, your yearly bonus is tied to that statement. Right.

596
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,810
I mean, no, I mean, I mean, I get that right. It's kind of the same thing.

597
00:25:34,819 --> 00:25:39,819
Like if, if someone, let's say builds a house and they have no accountability,

598
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:42,670
if it falls down, do they, why would they care?

599
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,040
Right. Like, whatever, just use the cheapest stuff. It doesn't matter.

600
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:47,250
The builder builds the house and if it does fall down they

601
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:50,239
just fold their company and reincorporate with a similar but different name.

602
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:53,119
-- And
-- I mean, that stuff like that does happen,

603
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:57,900
watch homes on homes. Right. That Canadian show where Holmes Holmes?

604
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,199
Wait, that guy is Canadian.

605
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,319
I didn't know that.

606
00:26:00,609 --> 00:26:01,459
-- So,
-- he,

607
00:26:02,109 --> 00:26:03,800
I've, I've watched it like, twice

608
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,410
and I just, it amuses me because he goes, and he's like, this is all terrible.

609
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:10,849
Everything sucks. And I'm like, this guy could be a security person.

610
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:11,260
I,

611
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:16,699
I was recently watching this H VAC guy who, you know, first person

612
00:26:16,819 --> 00:26:20,089
records him fixing these commercial HVAC systems and

613
00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:20,979
for example,

614
00:26:20,989 --> 00:26:23,300
he just spent hours on one and it turned out to be

615
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:26,140
that the drain pan was pushed up because the drainage wasn't run,

616
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:26,489
right.

617
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,640
So the drainage not only sloped up,

618
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,430
but it was

619
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:31,479
pushing the drain pan up in the middle.

620
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:33,119
And if you push a drain pan up in the middle, guess what?

621
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,680
It doesn't do, it doesn't drain. Exactly.

622
00:26:35,689 --> 00:26:37,369
So there was crazy ice build up that then

623
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,609
shorted out electronics and all this crazy stuff.

624
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:43,410
So literally he had to fix the drain pan pipe thing

625
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,260
and then he basically had to replace a pile of electronics and motors

626
00:26:46,459 --> 00:26:48,250
and now it works and it's fine.

627
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,589
But it reminds me of this, you know, it's, we see this all the time.

628
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:51,770
You know,

629
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:56,866
people do work the some limited liability corporation is responsible for and

630
00:26:56,876 --> 00:27:00,557
that LLC has no brand to protect and no assets to protect.

631
00:27:00,567 --> 00:27:01,666
So if it goes south,

632
00:27:01,827 --> 00:27:03,987
they just fold and rename.

633
00:27:04,046 --> 00:27:04,286
You know,

634
00:27:04,296 --> 00:27:08,026
this is why I'm considering buying Phillips hue bulbs because I bought single

635
00:27:08,577 --> 00:27:12,577
and they were garbage. I bought Globe bulbs at Costco

636
00:27:12,807 --> 00:27:16,996
and they, a bunch of them that are physically close like 20 ft or less away from the

637
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:18,004
hotspot.

638
00:27:18,104 --> 00:27:19,193
Keep de synchronizing.

639
00:27:19,203 --> 00:27:21,673
So you turn on the hall light and it like starts flashing

640
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:24,644
like an emergency signal and this is not a great experience.

641
00:27:24,654 --> 00:27:27,244
So I'm looking at the Phillips U because Phillips is a

642
00:27:27,254 --> 00:27:30,384
major electronics brand that has a brand name to protect.

643
00:27:30,413 --> 00:27:34,463
And I've literally had zero problems with my extremely expensive light bulbs

644
00:27:34,734 --> 00:27:38,624
which better not go over what I freak paid for these things. Like I'd be super mad.

645
00:27:38,744 --> 00:27:40,303
-- I
-- know I'm looking at these things and it's there

646
00:27:40,313 --> 00:27:42,161
are about three times as expensive as what I have.

647
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,350
Yeah, but now at the same time,

648
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,161
I've had them a long time and they literally never ever.

649
00:27:46,171 --> 00:27:48,541
And actually one of them died once I think we have,

650
00:27:48,551 --> 00:27:51,480
I talked about it on the podcast at some point, but like it died, I called them up.

651
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:52,681
They were like explain.

652
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:56,161
Yeah, this is what happened. They like we'll send you a new one. Like that was it,

653
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:56,531
it was

654
00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:01,840
-- like, OK, that's
-- cool. So yeah, no, like I said, I always come back to this.

655
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,270
I want a framework not only for making decisions

656
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:09,199
but for helping me feel good or at least OK about those decisions.

657
00:28:09,209 --> 00:28:13,520
I mean, yeah, I got, I got to think about this one man. I've got a lot to think about now.

658
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:13,939
And

659
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:19,239
I guess here's part of it as well and this is what I'll end on is you're mentioning.

660
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:23,040
So you've got an LLC builds a house, house collapses LLC dissolves.

661
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:28,339
-- But now at the same time in all this big mess, there's insurance,
-- a simpler example,

662
00:28:28,349 --> 00:28:30,250
builder builds an entire subdivision.

663
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:33,994
Subdivision has one and well, technically two entrances and exits,

664
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:35,834
but one of those entrances and exits

665
00:28:36,285 --> 00:28:37,785
has a rail line going through it

666
00:28:37,954 --> 00:28:42,375
and the rail cars sometimes tie that up for 56 minutes.

667
00:28:42,675 --> 00:28:45,314
And so the fire department is having trouble getting to the subdivision.

668
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:48,275
This is a real world thing like here in Edmonton. And,

669
00:28:48,724 --> 00:28:51,635
and I quote, the homeowners are saying

670
00:28:51,905 --> 00:28:55,295
the builder promised to build another entrance and exit that

671
00:28:55,305 --> 00:28:57,675
wasn't cut off by the rail line and they haven't.

672
00:28:57,834 --> 00:28:59,915
So now we want the city to do it. And it's like, well,

673
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:03,180
yeah, I bet the builder made a lot of promises that they didn't keep.

674
00:29:03,189 --> 00:29:04,500
This is an example,

675
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,750
I would say where there's probably multiple failures because

676
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,489
like the city shouldn't have allowed the permits.

677
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,050
You know what I mean?

678
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:12,500
-- Like you've got to put this stuff in writing,
-- they met the minimum standard.

679
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,939
So there's nothing illegal. It has two entrances and exits.

680
00:29:14,949 --> 00:29:18,770
So if the train is blocking the road and the fire department has to go around, it,

681
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,979
it takes about five minutes.

682
00:29:19,989 --> 00:29:24,115
Ok. So it's, it meets, it meets all the legal standards. It's just not

683
00:29:24,276 --> 00:29:26,296
nice because sometimes you have to wait a few

684
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,916
extra minutes for the fire department to show up,

685
00:29:27,926 --> 00:29:30,895
which when your house or in this case, a car is on fire in a driveway,

686
00:29:31,046 --> 00:29:33,156
people kind of want the fire department there. Now

687
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:37,936
again, this is that whole accountability versus responsibility thing

688
00:29:38,036 --> 00:29:41,105
-- when you're the homeowner, I guess. Good luck. I don't have a good answer
-- for

689
00:29:41,115 --> 00:29:41,336
that.

690
00:29:41,345 --> 00:29:41,446
No,

691
00:29:41,456 --> 00:29:43,875
there isn't because the homeowners aren't informed enough

692
00:29:43,885 --> 00:29:45,135
and don't know how the system works.

693
00:29:45,145 --> 00:29:45,395
And

694
00:29:45,515 --> 00:29:45,975
also

695
00:29:46,166 --> 00:29:49,302
they can't exert any control over builder, the builder built the house and sold it,

696
00:29:49,442 --> 00:29:50,651
right. What are you going to do?

697
00:29:50,661 --> 00:29:53,852
Well, apart from sue them, in which case, they're just going to fold and move on.

698
00:29:53,862 --> 00:29:56,491
-- I don't know.
-- That's a good one anyway, I'm calling it.

699
00:29:56,621 --> 00:29:57,371
So I guess

00:29:57,572 --> 00:30:00,852
