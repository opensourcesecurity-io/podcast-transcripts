Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 137 with myself,

1
00:00:10,909 --> 00:00:13,300
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:13,979
It,

3
00:00:13,989 --> 00:00:17,719
I feel like you are very thoughtful and stoic

4
00:00:17,729 --> 00:00:20,129
in that opening this time versus your usual.

5
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,139
Yeah, let's just do the intro and get going

6
00:00:23,799 --> 00:00:25,129
well. I mean,

7
00:00:25,909 --> 00:00:30,319
the world continues to slowly slide towards hell in

8
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:32,720
a handbasket with respect to the IOT and stuff.

9
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:33,259
I guess

10
00:00:35,139 --> 00:00:37,880
it never ends and it never will on the plus

11
00:00:37,889 --> 00:00:42,200
side as people who have a security podcast to do.

12
00:00:42,369 --> 00:00:44,490
We never have to worry about content.

13
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,250
So we have that advantage.

14
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,470
-- I still
-- can't believe somebody asking me.

15
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:51,380
So, what do you do when all the security bugs are fixed?

16
00:00:51,389 --> 00:00:53,909
Like, what will you do for work? And I just stared at them and I,

17
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,479
-- I literally just didn't know what to say because
-- no, no, there,

18
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,439
there is an answer to that when the security bugs are fixed.

19
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,720
It's because the machines have taken over and I can

20
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:07,519
only hope I'm killed in the first wave of antihuman

21
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,599
backlash

22
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,940
because I, I don't want to live in that world. Like I've seen the movies.

23
00:01:11,949 --> 00:01:13,080
-- It doesn't end
-- well.

24
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:15,650
You just have to watch those Boston Dynamics videos where

25
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,559
they're hitting the poor things with a hockey stick.

26
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,000
Yeah. Those are going to be used against us someday. Like,

27
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,540
like, look what you people did to us.

28
00:01:23,669 --> 00:01:25,089
-- Yeah.
-- The archives.

29
00:01:25,269 --> 00:01:27,260
Pretty much so. There you go.

30
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:32,230
-- We're, we're recording our own doom.
-- I think the beauty is this week. We just have,

31
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,000
we have so many ridiculous things. So I think

32
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:41,239
let's lead with maybe the most ridiculous but least dangerous one,

33
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:44,000
which is the Nike shoes kind of bricking.

34
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:45,750
Yeah. Ok. I

35
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:46,690
said

36
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,190
that.

37
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:47,540
Yeah.

38
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,919
Ok. Ok. I'm going to,

39
00:01:50,839 --> 00:01:53,300
I, I'm gonna say you can't brick a shoe

40
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,290
because when you brick a device,

41
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,970
we call it bricking because it's not worth anything, right?

42
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,169
It's, it has the value of a brick.

43
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,339
Whereas if you brick your shoes using the term brick and quotes here,

44
00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:05,180
there's still shoes, they still work.

45
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,220
If the laces or you can't tighten them up and they fall off your feet.

46
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,449
They're not really that useful.

47
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,399
I mean, we'll say they're less useful

48
00:02:12,619 --> 00:02:14,740
but you could still put them on your feet, you know,

49
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,070
but like those knockoff Crocs that have like a bad

50
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,139
strap that falls off and then the Crocs fall off,

51
00:02:19,149 --> 00:02:21,479
the knockoff Crocs fall off your feet all the time.

52
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,520
Ok.

53
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:23,759
We had that happen.

54
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:24,479
So, yeah, you know,

55
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,440
like the little strap on the Crocs that goes to the

56
00:02:26,449 --> 00:02:28,679
back around your heels so that they stay on your feet.

57
00:02:29,339 --> 00:02:31,259
Those come off sometimes. And so then

58
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:31,479
I

59
00:02:31,649 --> 00:02:32,419
never use those,

60
00:02:32,429 --> 00:02:36,839
the shoe falls off constantly and then while your shoes doesn't stay on your foot,

61
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:37,589
and that's kind of,

62
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:42,050
I, I think that's sort of the primary job description of a shoe is to stay on your foot.

63
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:46,179
Uh Sure.

64
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,240
So, and,

65
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,889
and the best part though was apparently this is due simply to the fact that Nike

66
00:02:51,029 --> 00:02:54,050
did a lot more testing with their I OS app, but then with their Android app.

67
00:02:54,059 --> 00:02:57,419
And so if you use the Android app to update your shoe firmware,

68
00:02:58,119 --> 00:03:00,779
you would mess it up

69
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:04,589
and I this. Ok. And, and I'm gonna use this expression. I love this expression.

70
00:03:04,899 --> 00:03:06,419
This begs the question.

71
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,100
Why does your shoe need a firmware update?

72
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,220
Why not?

73
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:10,979
Right.

74
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,070
We've got to put computer chips and everything,

75
00:03:14,429 --> 00:03:19,830
but I'm literally trying to understand what scenario that the firm wear of a shoe

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,520
needs an update.

77
00:03:21,779 --> 00:03:25,270
Like, do they have lights in them or something? And they, they put new patterns?

78
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,490
Well, you've got to figure it's a computer, right?

79
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,059
It has an operating system essentially. And so

80
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:36,800
maybe there's new drivers, maybe there's a security flaw in the wireless chip,

81
00:03:36,809 --> 00:03:38,710
maybe there's a new feature they're adding.

82
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,259
-- I mean, there's a million things it could be,
-- but that's what I'm trying to think of.

83
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:44,550
Like what new feature, I mean, maybe better gate or running or

84
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,880
maybe now it can detect the Saunter as

85
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:49,330
opposed to just jogging and running and walking.

86
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,669
Now I want a firmware update that's going to make me 20% faster. Right.

87
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:55,660
That's, that's what I'm looking for.

88
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:56,460
Yeah,

89
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:57,710
because I just,

90
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,419
I'm thinking about this because I was reading another article about, um,

91
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:05,289
so this is from a few days ago, city of Winnipeg manager in charge of police radios,

92
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,149
arrested after two year investigation and you know what he was arrested for,

93
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,960
he was arrested for.

94
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:15,720
So apparently Motorola radios, they charge uh what is it for a software update?

95
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,559
It was

96
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:25,170
they Ch Motorola charged about $94 Canadian. So about 70 us per update per radio.

97
00:04:25,609 --> 00:04:26,390
Ok.

98
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:27,140
And again,

99
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:29,109
why do these radios need so many firmware updates

100
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:32,119
because apparently they were updating these radios constantly.

101
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:32,470
Like

102
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,630
he basically managed to get like a um some stuff off of a ham radio operator

103
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,609
like a Java button and a USB key with a bunch of premade refresh keys.

104
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,559
Yeah, here we go.

105
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,989
According to the affidavit, the employee told police that in 2011,

106
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,790
Richardson gave him a device known as an eye button that was preloaded with more than

107
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:49,940
65,000 refresh keys and told him you don't want to know where these came from.

108
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:54,019
So I don't know if they hacked Motorola's refresh key system or he just

109
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,850
stole a whole bunch or whatever. But

110
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:59,929
again, why are these radios needing? So many firmware updates. Like,

111
00:05:00,589 --> 00:05:01,140
shouldn't,

112
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,299
shouldn't you basically produce the radio, put the software on it and, and largely

113
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,209
be done.

114
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:10,730
Uh, no, because do you know how these radios work these days?

115
00:05:10,739 --> 00:05:12,250
They're insanely complex.

116
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,089
-- But for
-- example, like, like, shouldn't the updates be, at least,

117
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,700
maybe at the most quarterly,

118
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,649
I think you could make that argument.

119
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,450
Yes.

120
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:21,279
Yeah.

121
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,630
I, well, and then, you know,

122
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,440
then the next bit of ridiculous news is this lime scooter.

123
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:28,390
Uh, so these Lime scooters apparently are throwing people off of them.

124
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:29,769
And I'm like, wait, how does that work?

125
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:30,089
Well,

126
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,209
the answer is the firmware has a bug where

127
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,910
the front wheel brake locks while you're going.

128
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,390
So,

129
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,700
for anybody who's ever driven on anything with two wheels like a

130
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:43,070
motorcycle or a scooter and you hit that front brake real hard,

131
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,260
you learn very quickly not to do that,

132
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,709
you know, because physics.

133
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,160
Right. Right.

134
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,309
And again, I'm just

135
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:49,880
ok.

136
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:53,549
So granted they need to, they, they clearly need to update that firmware because,

137
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:55,670
you know, these scooters literally are causing people

138
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,309
to get really hurt.

139
00:05:58,179 --> 00:06:02,029
Yes. But I, I'm just looking at this and, you know, I'm, I'm really

140
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,670
the internet of things,

141
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,630
especially when they're attached to, you know,

142
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,630
big heavy powerful machines or machines that process chemicals is,

143
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,109
it's getting a little terrifying.

144
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,859
So the internet of things,

145
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,989
you know, it's, we're, we're starting to attach everything to it. And

146
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,420
ok, we can argue that even you know, a shoe with bad firmware.

147
00:06:20,429 --> 00:06:24,390
You can assuming it has like, not those auto Titan laces like and back to the future,

148
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,200
you can at least still like, tie it to your foot and walk around,

149
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,559
you know,

150
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,850
something like an electric scooter where

151
00:06:28,859 --> 00:06:31,570
the front brakes suddenly just engages fully

152
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:35,720
and you're, you know, going say 5, 10 miles an hour, that's, that's gonna be a bad day.

153
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,970
Yes.

154
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,529
And people can get hurt.

155
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,910
It's, I want to laugh at this one but real people are getting hurt. So I won't.

156
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,609
Actually, there's, there's a, there's a guy who's in like a coma with like,

157
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:49,970
severe brain injuries from a few years ago, from one of these electric scooters.

158
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,369
-- Yeah.
-- I, I believe it

159
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,970
because these people don't wear helmets.

160
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,170
No, because you're usually

161
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:59,690
just, like hanging out and you want to go somewhere. It's not right.

162
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,529
You just happen upon it and it's an easy way to go.

163
00:07:02,785 --> 00:07:04,084
Get to a place.

164
00:07:04,095 --> 00:07:04,964
And so,

165
00:07:04,975 --> 00:07:07,904
and are you going to wear like a public helmet that's like tethered to the scooter?

166
00:07:07,915 --> 00:07:08,964
One size fits all.

167
00:07:08,975 --> 00:07:13,635
I totally would not because that's how you get some sort of parasite

168
00:07:13,894 --> 00:07:14,524
like,

169
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:17,825
-- unquestionably.
-- So, you know, these are tough questions.

170
00:07:17,834 --> 00:07:18,244
Like, do we,

171
00:07:18,255 --> 00:07:20,464
do we need to make everybody who's traveling

172
00:07:20,475 --> 00:07:22,105
faster than five miles an hour on wheels.

173
00:07:22,114 --> 00:07:25,445
Wear a helmet. Yeah. Well, we do that for kids nowadays. Right.

174
00:07:25,714 --> 00:07:29,404
Or at least locally anybody under 18 has to wear a bicycle helmet

175
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:30,619
if they're on a bicycle.

176
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,549
And the funny thing is I see parents out with their kids,

177
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:33,760
the kids are wearing helmets and the parents

178
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:35,529
aren't wearing helmets and it drives me nuts.

179
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:36,420
Interesting.

180
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:39,540
Uh, well, you know, adults get to make their own poor decisions. Apparently

181
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,059
that's fair. So,

182
00:07:41,489 --> 00:07:42,510
I don't know what to make of this. Right.

183
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:46,720
Because the reality is, I mean, if you're, if you're writing software for I OS,

184
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,299
that's one thing that's only, you've got like three kind of major versions, like

185
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,989
1011, 12, or is it 9, 1011,

186
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,600
whatever you've got like probably three or four major versions

187
00:07:55,739 --> 00:08:00,420
plus, you know, about two or three dozen devices to support that's manageable.

188
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,040
But then you look at the Android ecosystem and it's

189
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,170
how many versions of Android are currently out there in white, like,

190
00:08:07,179 --> 00:08:08,929
say more than 2% of the market.

191
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:14,579
I would bet more than 100 if I had to guess because there's countless revisions.

192
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:14,980
Yeah.

193
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,519
Well,

194
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:19,220
and then the carrier specific stuff and some of them make some pretty major changes.

195
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:22,700
If you, if you count that, it's probably thousands.

196
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:27,079
Yeah. Here we go. So, uh, jelly bean and up are all more than 2% jelly bean.

197
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:30,459
That's the 4.1 and up series is down to 3%

198
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,580
and dropping Kit Kat at 4.4 is at 7.6 and dropping.

199
00:08:34,739 --> 00:08:36,669
But then we have Oreo

200
00:08:36,869 --> 00:08:38,169
or sorry, going numerically.

201
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:41,989
So lollipop at five, that's the five series is like 18% in dropping.

202
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:46,510
The uh marshmallow at number six is at like 21% dropping.

203
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,960
And then we finally get to Nougat version seven and that's at like 28% and dropping.

204
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:55,070
And then finally Oreo eight point whatever is at 21% rising.

205
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,890
So you basically would have to support five major versions

206
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:00,890
to support 90 some percent of the market.

207
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,890
If you're willing to drop 10% of the market, you can get down to four ma well,

208
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,659
four major versions of Android with multiple subversion

209
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:13,489
-- and then multiple carrier specific things. Yeah,
-- it's kind of madness

210
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,570
and, and not only that,

211
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,109
it's even more complicated because ignoring these specific versions,

212
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,989
there are various hardware revisions, there's different screen sizes.

213
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,989
-- There
-- is, well, and you were saying there's, there's like the,

214
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:27,330
the proper CP US and the new, like really

215
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,030
cheap arm ones or something.

216
00:09:29,219 --> 00:09:30,710
I was talking with somebody and they were saying that there's

217
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:34,260
new CPU architecture that the really cheap android phones use.

218
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:37,830
-- So a lot of the apps aren't compatible at all.
-- I I don't know about that.

219
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,549
It wouldn't shock me if it's happening. I mean,

220
00:09:40,969 --> 00:09:44,460
depending upon how it was written, obviously, there's a 32 bit arm,

221
00:09:44,469 --> 00:09:47,710
there's 64 bit arm, there's some people doing MP stuff now.

222
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:49,750
Mis that was the one. Yeah. MP S

223
00:09:50,169 --> 00:09:51,880
Yeah, it was mis not arm, sorry or,

224
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,400
or there's even risk, the new risk Risk five,

225
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,830
which is like the open source processor is, is kind of coming into its its place.

226
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,679
And the reason behind that is if you use arm, you obviously have to pay arm,

227
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,705
holding some amount of money to make arm chips.

228
00:10:07,715 --> 00:10:12,734
Whereas the risk stuff is essentially open source so anybody can use it.

229
00:10:12,844 --> 00:10:14,174
And the thing to remember too, I mean,

230
00:10:14,184 --> 00:10:16,554
my understanding is a lot of these phones in developing countries, you know,

231
00:10:16,565 --> 00:10:21,155
we're talking about a $10 device so even a 10 cent royalty fee is too much for them.

232
00:10:21,164 --> 00:10:22,674
-- Yep.
-- Yep. Exactly.

233
00:10:23,114 --> 00:10:24,544
And so here's

234
00:10:24,674 --> 00:10:28,414
what I think of this and I've, I've thought about it a fair bit is

235
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,950
to date

236
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:34,070
security or even just quality of software

237
00:10:34,229 --> 00:10:36,309
we've gotten away with,

238
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,590
with highway robbery essentially where you can release

239
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:41,750
a piece of software that is really,

240
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,070
really bad and it doesn't really matter.

241
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,530
Right.

242
00:10:44,539 --> 00:10:48,440
It's never really mattered because what, what's the worst thing that happens?

243
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,330
Someone's computer stops working

244
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,229
and

245
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:55,419
once you start dealing with things like scooters or, I mean,

246
00:10:55,429 --> 00:10:57,659
kind of less so with shoes, we'll say

247
00:10:58,229 --> 00:11:01,700
people can start getting hurt. Right. Cars, cars are an easy one. Right.

248
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:05,950
Because it's just a giant death machine on wheels if it, if it goes off the rails.

249
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:10,570
And that's a weird analogy using rails. But anyway, the point is

250
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:14,640
once you start having physical things and people start getting actually hurt

251
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,099
now, the courts can get involved and this is something,

252
00:11:18,109 --> 00:11:19,770
it took me a long time to understand.

253
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,340
But so

254
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:24,799
the way, at least in the United States, I don't know how this works elsewhere.

255
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:25,880
But basically in the US,

256
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,750
if you can't show like physical injury or like

257
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,789
actual physical damages or somehow you lost real money,

258
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,010
you struggle to have any sort of reasonable kind

259
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,630
of defense in court or going after somebody.

260
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,429
Well, a case

261
00:11:38,859 --> 00:11:39,270
it's

262
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,989
no, you, in most jurisdictions, you have to show damages. You have to explain

263
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:47,429
how the defendant harmed or wronged you

264
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,909
-- in some material way. Right? Like
-- material damages, it can't be made up crap.

265
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:56,280
And this is where security has struggled in the courts because it was very,

266
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:58,390
very difficult to show real damages even with

267
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,140
something like heartbleed where you can say,

268
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:04,080
oh, but I had to update my fleet and it's like, well, like, explain that.

269
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:04,469
Right.

270
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:08,140
-- But you kind of have to do that anyways and blah, blah, blah. Yeah. No, I know.
-- Right.

271
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,299
Right. Exactly.

272
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:12,015
Because now when you have physical devices

273
00:12:12,025 --> 00:12:14,315
breaking and you have people getting hurt,

274
00:12:14,364 --> 00:12:18,554
now the courts are going to start paying attention, which is also going to gain the,

275
00:12:18,565 --> 00:12:20,835
I guess the eye of the regulators.

276
00:12:20,924 --> 00:12:25,794
And as much as I know people talk about how regulation is too slow and it can't work.

277
00:12:25,804 --> 00:12:27,104
And this, that and another,

278
00:12:27,325 --> 00:12:31,195
it is quite literally the only option we have at this point

279
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:33,929
and I, it kind of makes me sad to say that.

280
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:37,669
But like, for real, if anyone can fix this, it's basically the regulators,

281
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:39,729
there's saying the market will fix it,

282
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,830
whatever the market doesn't give two craps about security.

283
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,809
And I think that's been proven more times than I can count.

284
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,750
Well, and the good news is we already have some good legal frameworks for this.

285
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,349
Like in Europe they have the fit for purpose for products.

286
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,859
And there you can make a strong argument if you buy a product, let's say,

287
00:12:54,869 --> 00:12:56,419
for the sake of argument, you buy a fridge

288
00:12:56,739 --> 00:12:59,380
and the fridge has a firm firmware issue.

289
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,599
So it doesn't function properly, you know, within, I think, what is it? Two years?

290
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,580
Yeah, you get a two year legal guarantee

291
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:09,000
against faulty goods or goods that don't look or work as advertised

292
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,010
this.

293
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,770
And so this is a wonderful kind of catch all law that

294
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:16,239
really potentially solves this problem at least for the first two years,

295
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:16,969
you know,

296
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:18,460
but

297
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,750
I doubt we'll ever see anything like that in North America because man, oh man,

298
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,159
getting that passed would be uh,

299
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,690
yeah, I don't feel like that's gonna happen.

300
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:26,700
Right.

301
00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:27,440
So,

302
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,280
but I guess moving along and then the next thing is

303
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:34,049
you can no longer plug anything into your USB port safely.

304
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,400
So I guess we have to hot glue them all shut, which

305
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:39,919
I was actually wondering about this because

306
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,760
all my chromebooks

307
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,320
and my new Macbook Air.

308
00:13:45,609 --> 00:13:48,450
They don't have a charging port, they just have USB ports.

309
00:13:48,789 --> 00:13:49,359
Right.

310
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,919
I guess you just buy a new laptop every morning at Amazon.

311
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:54,460
Yes. I think that is

312
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,179
the best option by far.

313
00:13:57,289 --> 00:13:57,669
It.

314
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,489
No.

315
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,729
So this story is about people hiding what it was

316
00:14:01,739 --> 00:14:04,349
a Wi Fi device essentially in a USB plug.

317
00:14:04,849 --> 00:14:08,530
So when you plugged it in, it could do magic and we'll just put the term magic.

318
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:11,380
-- Well, it's,
-- it's, it's, it's, this has always been possible.

319
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:15,969
It's just the Wi Fi chip sets were never physically small enough to like literally,

320
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:20,260
this is a, it looks like a USB cable with that little sort of one by one or well,

321
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,840
I guess three quarters of an inch, whatever it is, it's small,

322
00:14:22,989 --> 00:14:23,969
you know, plug on the end.

323
00:14:23,979 --> 00:14:27,169
But now, yeah, you can fit a full Wi Fi chip set and everything in there.

324
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:28,630
And obviously it's powered off the USB

325
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,099
and it can present as a, what is it a human interface device like a keyboard, meaning

326
00:14:33,349 --> 00:14:35,690
you, you plug this what looks like just

327
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,039
a normal USB cable into your laptop.

328
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:40,479
And all of a sudden it means somebody can connect to it via Wi Fi

329
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,330
and send

330
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,159
inject keystrokes to your laptop or mouse movement or whatever, right?

331
00:14:46,369 --> 00:14:49,239
Because, well, I was thinking uh you know, those UB keys, they make those really,

332
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,409
really tiny ones for laptops that just stick out like two millimeters,

333
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,250
you know, and I was thinking of that.

334
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,090
Like, we already have, um,

335
00:14:56,099 --> 00:14:59,049
I know one of my laptops permanently has like a little logitech mouse

336
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,880
sting of a jigger jacked into it. So the mouse works right.

337
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:04,520
Because the mouse is some wonky, not Bluetooth standard

338
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,679
that needs a little, you know, USB plug.

339
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:10,239
Have you made sure that little Dongle isn't vulnerable to the,

340
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:12,460
what do they call it? Click, jacking flaw.

341
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,940
Oh, it probably totally is.

342
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:17,734
But it's the windows laptop that basically I turn on to update once a month and then

343
00:15:18,195 --> 00:15:22,224
-- OK, stare at it and wonder why I haven't thrown it out.
-- Right.

344
00:15:22,494 --> 00:15:24,505
Uh Because that's literally all I use it for.

345
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:24,765
So,

346
00:15:24,775 --> 00:15:29,054
one of the fun facts about those is a guy named Mark Newland did a bunch of research.

347
00:15:29,065 --> 00:15:32,414
I forget which company he's with right now. But basically he found out that

348
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:35,065
those little dongles that you use with your mice.

349
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,429
They are the same dongles they use with the, the keyboards.

350
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,469
So you can basically connect to them

351
00:15:40,719 --> 00:15:44,270
again with a keyboard. Oh, yeah. No, I know this and they have no encryption.

352
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:46,070
I know. No handshakes. Nothing.

353
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:46,469
Yeah.

354
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:48,510
No, this is probably gonna, I,

355
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,119
I was trying to play Minecraft on this laptop but uh with the, the new Minecraft,

356
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:52,510
it was OK.

357
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,179
But with the old Java Minecraft, I was getting like 12 frames per second.

358
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,469
So kind of unusable.

359
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,309
Nice.

360
00:15:57,599 --> 00:16:01,429
No, it's just, it's, I think part of it is like remember when Key Ghost came out

361
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:04,869
probably one or two decades ago. And it basically looked like a PS two

362
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,719
uh extension cable. And for those of you that don't know what that is.

363
00:16:07,729 --> 00:16:09,719
PS two is the old timey keyboard center.

364
00:16:09,729 --> 00:16:12,309
It's a little round thing with like what four pins.

365
00:16:13,109 --> 00:16:18,250
-- Uh I think it was and,
-- um, I'm, I'm gladly don't remember and I don't want to.

366
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,130
So the idea with Key Ghost was very simple.

367
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:24,559
It was powered off the PS two and it had a little bit of as, you know, memory

368
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:29,159
that would store all the keystrokes it received. So you plug it in to somebody's

369
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,049
desktop.

370
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:31,929
This is back when we had desktops,

371
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:35,570
not laptops and you go and collect it after a day or two and, you know,

372
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,080
you would have the person's passwords.

373
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:40,690
So this, this physical security has always been a problem.

374
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,369
And, and there are literally places that will hot, glue shut all the USB ports

375
00:16:44,929 --> 00:16:47,960
and then put like a DVD burner reader in the,

376
00:16:47,969 --> 00:16:50,450
in the laptop or device to move data around.

377
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,950
But like I said, I, I, all the modern laptops don't have a power port.

378
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,260
-- They just have USB. Yeah,
-- look,

379
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:01,390
gluing USB port shut is not a practical solution.

380
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:02,950
It just, it, it isn't.

381
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,829
I think about this one a lot and I guess here's there, there's two ways to think of it.

382
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,589
Number one,

383
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:12,760
this is not a, an attack that's going to practically affect most people.

384
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:14,199
That's just the honest one.

385
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:14,329
I

386
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:16,300
was just thinking, I'm going to RS A

387
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:18,660
and, you know, there's a lot of

388
00:17:18,848 --> 00:17:21,189
laptops and whatnot on the show floor.

389
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:25,510
They're may be tied down or Kensington locked down or whatever that the hole in

390
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,640
the laptop that you jam a little lock into and tie it to something else.

391
00:17:29,219 --> 00:17:32,300
Or is Kensington the brand? I forget what that name of that hole is called whatever.

392
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,810
I think it's maybe Kensington is the people who make the locks. I don't know,

393
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:37,750
but I was thinking for a lot of these, definitely,

394
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,000
there's a lot of machines that are not sort of very well physically secured.

395
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,520
Now, hopefully somebody would notice you plugging something into this,

396
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,760
but I'm thinking more of the attack of what if somebody's giving

397
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:49,709
away free lightning cables to charge your phone off your laptop?

398
00:17:49,719 --> 00:17:51,750
I mean, lightning cables cost like five or 10 bucks.

399
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,430
-- I bet if you handed those out at a show, people would take them and
-- this is where

400
00:17:56,719 --> 00:17:59,890
you have to start thinking about what does it mean?

401
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,130
So when I say it doesn't affect most people, I mean,

402
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:07,130
we'll say normal people who don't go to computer security trade shows, right?

403
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,359
It is conceivable. Some are going to get caught up in something like this.

404
00:18:10,369 --> 00:18:13,650
If somebody say starts dropping cables on the ground at the park,

405
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:15,810
which is completely plausible,

406
00:18:15,939 --> 00:18:18,520
but the reality is that isn't going to happen to most people.

407
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:22,930
Now, if you go to RS A, don't plug anything that has a USB port on it.

408
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:27,449
Anything, like, just full stop. Right. If you're in any sort of high risk venue,

409
00:18:27,619 --> 00:18:28,540
-- don't
-- use the

410
00:18:28,979 --> 00:18:31,229
-- venue. Really? Yeah,
-- that's fair.

411
00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:33,829
Like, I see those phone charging stations where you, like,

412
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:35,750
lock your phone in a little cabinet to recharge it.

413
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,469
And it's like, well, number one don't, how good are those locks?

414
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,540
-- I don't want to lose my phone. Go
-- buy a $10 battery. Right.

415
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,020
Go buy a $10 battery and you're fine

416
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:47,069
is the reality of that.

417
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,989
And so here's,

418
00:18:49,219 --> 00:18:51,510
here's my view on this. All right. Number one,

419
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:54,959
these aren't small enough, you're not gonna notice today.

420
00:18:54,969 --> 00:18:56,180
I mean, they might get there someday,

421
00:18:56,189 --> 00:18:59,959
but basically look at your stuff if you see something plugged into it, you know,

422
00:18:59,969 --> 00:19:03,380
something crazy is going on and don't ever use that computer again.

423
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,569
Right. Give that to somebody who knows what they're doing and let them take it apart.

424
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:06,709
Well,

425
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:08,369
that's not really useful advice for somebody who

426
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,020
only has the one laptop or whatever.

427
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:10,540
I mean, I,

428
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,459
I think part of this goes to it.

429
00:19:12,469 --> 00:19:14,969
-- It,
-- it has to be though, like,

430
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:16,900
well, no, no, but I think this maybe goes to the, the,

431
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:19,849
the model of like the chromebooks where you can just power wash it and re

432
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:20,380
in

433
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:23,260
and in theory that should completely wipe it

434
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:29,550
and, and this is also why I travel with a chromebook to things like this because it is

435
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:32,349
infinitely more secure and predictable

436
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,540
in an environment like that. Right.

437
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:38,699
A regular laptop, I don't freaking trust a regular laptop as far as I can see.

438
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:41,479
-- It just no way
-- because the other thing I was thinking is

439
00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:44,520
I know you can do USB device filtering based on its,

440
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,750
you know, ID and everything.

441
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:49,260
But the problem is, for example, I mean, Apple is a great example of this is, you know,

442
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,579
there's,

443
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:53,500
there's certain USB peripherals that Apple cells that are very common that well,

444
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,660
you'd have to whitelist them,

445
00:19:54,930 --> 00:20:00,300
you know, like I've got my little USB C to regular USB plug and I've got my USB C to HDM I

446
00:20:00,469 --> 00:20:03,459
breakout thing, you know, for, for doing presentations or whatever, right?

447
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,099
So even if I whitelist

448
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:05,520
it,

449
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:09,459
it still wouldn't be very hard to make a hostile USB device that identifies as like,

450
00:20:09,469 --> 00:20:10,900
yeah, I'm a, I'm an Apple uh

451
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:15,300
-- USB cable. Nothing to see here,
-- right? It's, it's trivial to do that.

452
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:18,660
And in fact, for those of you listening, if you ever want to have some fun.

453
00:20:18,709 --> 00:20:21,060
So the Raspberry Pi Zero

454
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:24,140
has the ability to basically turn itself into

455
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,939
a magic USB device and pretend it's something else

456
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:28,229
which is really cool.

457
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:32,469
You can just do this in software, you can plug it into a computer in USB.

458
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:34,239
The USB power is the freaking thing

459
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,670
and then it pretends it's something. It's not,

460
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:37,920
which was actually used.

461
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,119
Somebody built, uh, I forget what they called it now,

462
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,010
but basically you plugged it into a computer

463
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,890
and it said, oh, route all internet traffic through me.

464
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,310
I'm the best place for your internet

465
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:48,790
traffic and obviously websites and everything started,

466
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:48,910
like,

467
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,810
dumping internet into the raspberry pie and it was logging all kinds of garbage.

468
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:55,449
Which was, yeah, that's a neat attack.

469
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:56,339
But it, I,

470
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,849
I feel like

471
00:20:58,339 --> 00:20:59,689
this is something

472
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,530
that

473
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:03,719
you can't, you can't technically stop,

474
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:07,739
but it's also not going to be a significant problem for most people.

475
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,640
And I'm going, I'm, I'm always gonna come back to the story of

476
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:16,359
-- if you are being targeted by an adversary with resources, you cannot stop them.
-- But,

477
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:20,290
and physical access, physical access is the real thing. Right?

478
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,310
And that's a big part of it. I mean, this is part of the story is if you're

479
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:27,680
like Rs A or black hat or really any, any sort of conference even

480
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:30,420
and you leave your laptop in your hotel room even

481
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,420
if it's in the safe because like those safes are,

482
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,750
are pretty freaking worthless.

483
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,030
If you're concerned you're being targeted, that's when they're gonna get you.

484
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,569
Right. Keep that thing on your back.

485
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:40,449
If it's something you're actually worried about. Yeah.

486
00:21:40,459 --> 00:21:44,219
No, I, I really do think the future of this is that kind of chromebook model of, oh,

487
00:21:44,229 --> 00:21:45,410
I think I might have been compromised.

488
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,079
-- All right. Burn it. All down and log in again. Right.
-- Right.

489
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:54,199
And, and at the same time, this is not a useful way to spend our mental resources.

490
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:57,390
We all have a limited amount of capacity in terms

491
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,300
of dealing with just like the world around us and,

492
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:04,170
and being worried about getting a USB cable that has Wi Fi on it,

493
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:07,939
that some adversary is going to use to inject keystrokes.

494
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,329
Like I'm not, I'm not going to say you shouldn't worry about it.

495
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:13,390
But like, if that's your biggest fear.

496
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,219
Yeah, you're not me. Right.

497
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,229
And I'm just, I'm gonna say I stand corrected.

498
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:18,030
I was just checking,

499
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,420
I was plugging some of my Apple USB devices into my laptop and running IO

500
00:22:21,589 --> 00:22:21,750
Reg

501
00:22:22,469 --> 00:22:26,099
and they don't seem to be showing up like I see my podcast or I see my,

502
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:30,489
the external hard drive but I don't see the actual,

503
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,780
like Ethernet adapter or anything like that showing up.

504
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,589
So they don't seem to have a USB ID

505
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,550
but they should,

506
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:37,770
I don't know.

507
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,989
-- I have
-- no idea.

508
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:43,359
It's also a Mac. Like Apple does crazy, weird stuff.

509
00:22:43,369 --> 00:22:43,439
I,

510
00:22:43,449 --> 00:22:46,359
I would never trust what a Mac tells me because

511
00:22:46,369 --> 00:22:49,479
I maybe rightly so think they're smarter than me.

512
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:52,229
Where is that? That's the one thing I'll say I like about Linux.

513
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,979
You're just holding it wrong.

514
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,380
Exactly. Exactly. What do I know

515
00:22:56,569 --> 00:22:57,449
where, where

516
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,290
the Linux laptop is happy to just like, you know,

517
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,199
dump more information than I can possibly do anything with on

518
00:23:03,209 --> 00:23:05,410
top of me and then it gives me warm fuzzies.

519
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,430
So everything is fine. It's all fine. It's all fine

520
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,050
anyway. So we're doomed again.

521
00:23:12,579 --> 00:23:13,689
That's all.

522
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:18,489
Well, it really does drive home the whole physical security matters and I,

523
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,349
I can't help but think that's one of the reasons cloud computing

524
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:24,030
is such a wonderful thing because

525
00:23:24,709 --> 00:23:25,989
generally speaking,

526
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,729
those Google and Amazon and Microsoft

527
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,400
data centers will have infinitely better physical

528
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:34,729
security than any server closet in a small and medium business ever can.

529
00:23:35,709 --> 00:23:37,719
And that's assuming they even have one because like,

530
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,349
I've,

531
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:40,300
I've seen so many firms where they just literally have

532
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:43,459
the one server stuck in like somebody's office closet.

533
00:23:43,469 --> 00:23:45,729
-- Yeah.
-- No. Lock on the door. Right.

534
00:23:45,739 --> 00:23:48,969
-- It's, that happens so often
-- and, and, and I can't blame him.

535
00:23:48,979 --> 00:23:52,569
-- You're not going to build a server closet for one machine. Right.
-- Right. Yep.

536
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,609
In fact, I remember I used to work at an ISP, like 1000

537
00:23:55,709 --> 00:23:57,339
years ago, the server

538
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:01,630
was literally a machine sitting on a desk in the corner.

539
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:06,010
There was no security, there was granted that the door had a lock on it.

540
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,489
But yeah, it was, in fact, you could look through the front window and see it.

541
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,180
That's how it worked. Fantastic. And,

542
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:17,680
but here's the thing at the same time. Did it matter? No, no, it didn't. Right.

543
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:20,000
Nobody ever broke in. Nobody ever stole the stuff.

544
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:23,199
-- Oh, I'd be more concerned about somebody turning it off.
-- Uh, that, that did happen.

545
00:24:24,099 --> 00:24:25,560
Yeah, that, that happened more than once

546
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:29,109
the building had redundant power.

547
00:24:29,229 --> 00:24:31,510
But yeah, uh, there was a third strip,

548
00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:33,849
uh, that it was, it was plugged into

549
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,849
and it was, uh, we'll say it didn't happen very often,

550
00:24:36,859 --> 00:24:38,650
but it got turned off more than once.

551
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:42,410
And I, I, man, I have some great stories from that though because this was,

552
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,290
this was back when I SPS were like brand freaking new dial up was brand new

553
00:24:46,449 --> 00:24:51,290
and there's just so much was just like madness and it was a miracle. Anything worked.

554
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,020
I mean, we ran the whole freaking ISP,

555
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,589
ran up one T one at the time when I started like

556
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:58,280
to give you an idea of how small we're talking about.

557
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,189
No, I remember that

558
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:03,410
-- back when a 1.544 megabits was the cat's meow.
-- Yeah.

559
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,349
And, and the thing is,

560
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:06,619
I thought it was awesome because I'd go into the office and

561
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,760
I had an Ethernet connection to the T one and I'm like,

562
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:12,579
look at this, I can download a Linux distribution in a couple of hours.

563
00:25:12,589 --> 00:25:13,150
Right.

564
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,750
Seriously. That was 600 megabytes.

565
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,459
Mind you, this wasn't like the four gigabyte DVD s we're talking about here

566
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,420
and then of course, we also had a CD burner,

567
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:25,770
-- which is very convenient because I didn't own one at home because CD
-- burners,

568
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,800
they were expensive.

569
00:25:26,829 --> 00:25:27,180
Yes.

570
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,359
Yeah. No, man, that was those were the days

571
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,020
anyway anyway.

572
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:36,140
So I feel like I'm going to make an effort to stop ending these podcasts on,

573
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,060
on a terrible note.

574
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:38,819
And I feel like at this point it again,

575
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:42,380
sounds like the world is on fire and nothing is ever going to get better.

576
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,329
And so

577
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:47,160
I guess let's, let's shift our conversation for the next couple of minutes and say,

578
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,040
given everything we've talked about,

579
00:25:50,689 --> 00:25:55,209
are they going to lead us in a place that makes the world better

580
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,060
the same or worse

581
00:25:57,199 --> 00:25:57,550
for?

582
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,349
Well, for example, the, the,

583
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:01,160
the electric scooters and I get that there's people

584
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,290
that hate them and people that love them.

585
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,619
But I think for example,

586
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,739
at least we're now talking about alternative forms of

587
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,709
transportation if nothing else potentially in some climates,

588
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:11,310
like not where I live because we have snow and ice for six months of the year.

589
00:26:11,479 --> 00:26:14,660
But in a climate like San Francisco, I think those electric scooters

590
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,390
really do represent potentially.

591
00:26:17,949 --> 00:26:18,180
Yeah,

592
00:26:18,189 --> 00:26:22,439
maybe that sort of last mile problem with respect to delivery of people to a place.

593
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:25,800
You know, for example, like the city buses here all have the bike rack on the front,

594
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:28,609
which is kind of a pain in the ass because the bus stops, the guy,

595
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,819
you know, you better know how to work those bike racks to get your bike on and off.

596
00:26:31,829 --> 00:26:32,209
Right.

597
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,229
And I'm thinking something like an electric scooter would be in, you know,

598
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:38,609
especially if it folds like a, like most razor scooters do.

599
00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:39,859
But even if it doesn't fold,

600
00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:43,229
it would still on a bus be a lot more manageable than a bicycle.

601
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:46,140
And so I feel like there's nothing else.

602
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,670
I personally, I would rather have a world with new and crazy stuff.

603
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,729
That's definitely,

604
00:26:51,739 --> 00:26:55,900
probably has insecure software than a world that's like stagnant and, oh, you know,

605
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:59,400
we can't do that until we perfect the software and address every edge case.

606
00:26:59,829 --> 00:27:01,189
Uh, and now having said that obviously,

607
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:03,829
I don't want electric scooters that are throwing people off of them and giving them,

608
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:06,699
you know, severe injuries or potentially killing them.

609
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:07,479
Right. Right.

610
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:12,150
But the reality is, I mean, we accept a certain level of risk in life and if you look at,

611
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,770
you know, human driven cars, the, the not the death toll even, but just the carnage,

612
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,150
you know,

613
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:20,839
that the number of people that are injured severely in car accidents.

614
00:27:20,989 --> 00:27:24,969
Yeah. No, I mean, clearly we, we accept a certain level of, uh,

615
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,510
people mingling as we always have.

616
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,920
You know, you look at the industrial revolution and the stories that are

617
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:31,119
terrible.

618
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,050
Well, in,

619
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:35,250
in the industrial revolution is the exact parallel I would use here

620
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:40,250
is it was horrific and unfortunately just given the nature of humans,

621
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,609
it had to get worse before it could get better.

622
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,530
And I think a lot of this iot security is the same story where

623
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,285
it's probably going to get worse and people are going to get hurt

624
00:27:49,295 --> 00:27:51,464
and they're going to get killed and they're going to get maimed.

625
00:27:51,494 --> 00:27:55,324
And unfortunately I wish it didn't have to happen, but I think it's going to have to,

626
00:27:55,334 --> 00:27:56,744
before people start to care.

627
00:27:56,755 --> 00:28:00,145
And then I think once they start to care, things can start to get better

628
00:28:00,275 --> 00:28:04,734
because just humans are, are annoying in this way. Is we?

629
00:28:04,994 --> 00:28:06,055
Well, I don't know,

630
00:28:06,064 --> 00:28:09,074
I guess I don't want to delve too much into like dealing with humans.

631
00:28:09,084 --> 00:28:09,785
Honestly, my,

632
00:28:09,795 --> 00:28:12,214
my hope is that the things like the cloud providers

633
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:15,824
with their cloud IOT integrations and their software development kits,

634
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:20,290
you know, arm has released like a software development kit for IOT devices.

635
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,890
And so back to the frameworks of, you know,

636
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,619
almost nobody can write memory management software or even file parsing software.

637
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:30,119
So that's why you use a framework and then you put your magic sauce on top of it.

638
00:28:30,219 --> 00:28:32,989
And I think that's the way to go, you know, ideally, you know,

639
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
like all these IOT devices are running Linux.

640
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:37,760
Like my, I just got the lego V three Mindstorms.

641
00:28:37,989 --> 00:28:38,010
I

642
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,670
was watching it boot up and it's running

643
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,630
-- Linux kernel 2.4 0.33 something that's old
-- man.

644
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,010
-- Well, it's, it's LEGO man, it doesn't matter,
-- you know, update, update your KGO

645
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,609
you should get on that like update that sucker, right? Then you could brick it.

646
00:28:50,619 --> 00:28:54,510
Hey, brick. If you brick your Lego thing, that's like totally apt. Right?

647
00:28:54,619 --> 00:28:57,599
Because they are lego bricks, you brick the brick. I like it.

648
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:03,949
So anyway, I, I think your points are all quite valid and I feel like

649
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:08,609
we are on the cusp of new technologies and new things and some are crazy.

650
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:11,310
Some will work, some won't work. And unfortunately

651
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:14,489
we just are going to have to go through these growing pains.

652
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:14,750
But I,

653
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:20,380
I do feel like things are going to get better because entering the realm of physical

654
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,469
makes certain groups that have historically not paid attention by certain groups.

655
00:29:24,479 --> 00:29:25,030
I mostly mean,

656
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,150
like regulators and lawyers that have basically not paid

657
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,550
attention to this technology are going to start.

658
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:34,869
And I think, you know, things like arm providing frameworks,

659
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,349
ironically,

660
00:29:36,449 --> 00:29:39,079
I know they're doing it because they want more people to use their stuff.

661
00:29:39,089 --> 00:29:42,880
But I have a suspicion we're going to end up in a place where people are going to say,

662
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:45,229
well, if you're giving people the tools, like,

663
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:47,130
put some freaking safety guards in those tools.

664
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:50,209
Right. Stop letting people saw their arm off on accident.

665
00:29:50,364 --> 00:29:51,354
Well, and you're right.

666
00:29:51,364 --> 00:29:55,344
Like, I feel like end users will actually be able to show damages. Right.

667
00:29:55,354 --> 00:29:58,864
And, yeah, exactly. And I think that's exactly where we're going to end up. So,

668
