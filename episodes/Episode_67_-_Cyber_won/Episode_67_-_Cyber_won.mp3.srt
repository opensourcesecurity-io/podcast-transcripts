Hello and welcome to episode 67 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:09,890
Kurt

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,100
Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime. Josh Pressers.

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,219
I feel like 67 should be an important number.

4
00:00:16,409 --> 00:00:17,420
And I don't know why

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:18,670
is it prime? I

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,690
-- wonder if it's prime because
-- 7890, yeah. No, that's why,

7
00:00:22,909 --> 00:00:23,629
why is six

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,260
of 7789

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,930
-- maybe that's what you're thinking of. The
-- seven did eat nine

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:30,520
apparently.

11
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,040
So I'm told, I don't know,

12
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,569
I 63 to 7 and it's also a prime number. I just looked it up.

13
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,959
-- So
-- primes are pretty awesome.

14
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,009
-- Primes are awesome.
-- Speaking

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:38,220
of.

16
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:40,279
So, yeah, my, my partner,

17
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not allowed to fold

18
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,700
towels or she basically, I'm only allowed to fold washcloths

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,319
because wash cloths are folded in halves.

20
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,959
But she folds everything else into divisions of three or other prime numbers,

21
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,409
which I'm not good at, I fold by hat,

22
00:00:56,619 --> 00:00:58,740
which is not acceptable apparently.

23
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,849
Ok.

24
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,569
Ok. Go on.

25
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:07,370
Well, just speaking of primes. Right.

26
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:09,650
And, and I do have to admit in an aesthetic sense,

27
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,410
like most towels do look nicer folded into thirds

28
00:01:13,419 --> 00:01:15,220
rather than halves because you get that nice,

29
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,589
sort of doubled over effect.

30
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,400
It's true.

31
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:19,029
Is that

32
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,309
-- more of a golden ratio?
-- Right. Right.

33
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:23,589
And that was going to be my question, is that because it's a prime,

34
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:26,480
or is it like one of the Fibonacci type series numbers?

35
00:01:26,809 --> 00:01:27,260
Which is

36
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:27,610
my

37
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,629
-- golden ratio type deal?
-- Right. Right. Which I

38
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:34,069
guess ironically the first couple of Fibonacci numbers

39
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,360
are primed but regardless it doesn't matter.

40
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:37,680
So.

41
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:38,559
Right.

42
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:40,680
Nothing happened this week. Right.

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,360
Um, nothing of terrible.

44
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,430
I honestly,

45
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,989
you know, I think part of it is,

46
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,629
things have to be so bad before I even notice them anymore.

47
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:56,040
Yes, I feel the same way. I feel like everything is just so on fire at this point.

48
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,440
Like, eh, whatever.

49
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,250
Yeah, I can't think of any massive data breaches.

50
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,529
I mean, the, the, the,

51
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,470
the sort of one of the biggest on and this is

52
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,629
an ongoing train wreck is that classic bit of legislation about,

53
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:09,029
you know, allowing companies to hack back.

54
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:09,119
Oh,

55
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,610
my goodness. That thing

56
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,289
-- go away.
-- But the thing is, it's,

57
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,729
I think the problem is

58
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:18,889
if you think of the internet as a series of tubes, that makes sense.

59
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,529
But the pro

60
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:21,779
right

61
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:23,500
is that, you know, these,

62
00:02:23,679 --> 00:02:24,289
uh, I

63
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,059
mean,

64
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,919
we don't even allow this in the physical world.

65
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:30,399
Like you can't, for example, rig up a shotgun on a trip wire in your house because,

66
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,619
like, what if there's a fire and some poor fireman comes in?

67
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,750
Yes. Right. So, we have well established doctrine in the real world

68
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,309
of, there are like, very

69
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,029
strict limits even in jurisdictions where, like,

70
00:02:43,339 --> 00:02:43,910
um,

71
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,039
what do you have? It's called Castle Doctrine, right?

72
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,360
Where your home is your castle and, like,

73
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:49,250
you are legally allowed to shoot people coming in

74
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:51,399
and in some jurisdictions, I know

75
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:54,300
you're even allowed to shoot people in the back when

76
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:56,380
they're fleeing if they've taken your property because you,

77
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,820
you're allowed to, you know, essentially recover your property.

78
00:02:59,009 --> 00:02:59,559
Um,

79
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:01,960
I live in Canada. So that's really not the case here.

80
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,080
We're, we're like, no, in Canada we're not allowed

81
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,869
to, to do these things. Right.

82
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,880
It's, we're expected to essentially, our strategy is to flee.

83
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:12,279
You know, you're not allowed to stand your ground.

84
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:14,850
That's not a valid defense if you murder somebody in your house.

85
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,949
I mean, you can try but it's, it's not like the US where it's

86
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,880
in some places. That's ok. Great. You know, done deal

87
00:03:21,289 --> 00:03:23,050
even in the physical world,

88
00:03:23,059 --> 00:03:27,970
even in the jurisdictions where we do allow that sort of attack back scenario.

89
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:30,570
It's still incredibly limited,

90
00:03:31,059 --> 00:03:31,500
right?

91
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:36,130
And, uh, like a great example that's actually somewhat applicable is drones,

92
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:36,529
right?

93
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:39,539
Uh, those people flying drones over other people's properties.

94
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,750
Well, you can't just

95
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,990
get out your skeet shotgun and start blasting away.

96
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,470
I mean, you can, but you shouldn't.

97
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,169
Um, and actually this week you put in the show

98
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,960
there was actually wire. Was it wired?

99
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,610
Did a really there was a little, uh, company that did, um,

100
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,899
a review of some anti drone technologies and one of them was actually,

101
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:02,669
that works. Surprisingly all was a 12 gauge shotgun shell with like a little net net

102
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:06,309
that you shot at the drone and it tangled up the rotors and,

103
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,139
you know, wall out

104
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:08,279
and is that legal?

105
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:11,009
It depends where you live

106
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,449
here.

107
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:17,130
My general understanding is, is that shooting any firearm in the city is, you know,

108
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,089
frowned upon

109
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,119
heavily

110
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,358
for some reason.

111
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:21,809
Well,

112
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,700
I'm not even legally allowed to use air pellet guns or bow and arrow in the backyard,

113
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:28,369
which I'm kind of angry about.

114
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,920
But whatever, I don't know,

115
00:04:30,869 --> 00:04:30,929
windows

116
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:34,670
-- and
-- other
-- people I live in the US, I'm sure I can do whatever I want.

117
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,510
But I mean, you know, in a dense urban area,

118
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:41,429
it kind of maybe makes sense not to be using like a 400 pound crossbow

119
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,769
in a suburban neighborhood, one would think.

120
00:04:45,109 --> 00:04:48,390
But so this hack back idea, even in the physical world where we have some very,

121
00:04:48,739 --> 00:04:50,089
you know, things are, I mean,

122
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,899
for example, if somebody's waddling out your front door with a 32 inch TV,

123
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:58,489
you know, chances are they didn't accidentally get the wrong house.

124
00:04:58,619 --> 00:04:59,690
You know, there are some TV,

125
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,730
repairman who got the wrong house and the door was unlocked and I,

126
00:05:02,989 --> 00:05:04,779
well, you know, this TV is broken.

127
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:08,799
-- So like I'm just taking it out to the truck to take it to the shop to fix it. Right.
-- Like

128
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,420
I, I found it on the ground.

129
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:10,790
Right.

130
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:11,589
Exactly.

131
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:12,529
Yeah. So,

132
00:05:13,109 --> 00:05:15,010
and then we enter the cyber

133
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:16,459
world. Oh, God, I hate that word.

134
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,640
-- But anyways we enter the, you know, the online cyber world where,
-- like,

135
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,170
I'm going to say it now,

136
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:27,179
cyber one and as much as I hate it, like it just, it, it won and we have to use it and it's,

137
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,279
it is what it is.

138
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:28,920
Yeah.

139
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:32,260
Yeah. Exactly. Right. Remember cracking and hacking how that was like a huge thing.

140
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:33,359
And you know what I've given,

141
00:05:33,369 --> 00:05:37,559
I gave up on cracking a long time ago and I gave up on Cyber a long time ago.

142
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,959
Cyber 10, well,

143
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,000
well, language evolves. Right.

144
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,019
So, in the cyber world, you know,

145
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:46,929
just because host a attacks me doesn't mean the person

146
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,440
who actually owns host a is involved at all other than

147
00:05:49,859 --> 00:05:52,220
they maybe have a poorly secured system

148
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,519
or somebody spoofed them.

149
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,609
Right. Because Lord knows we've never had, you know, d

150
00:05:57,739 --> 00:05:59,880
OS amplification attacks where you spoof

151
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,350
a

152
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:01,279
target

153
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:04,959
-- and get them slammed. Right.
-- I think it's even more, more simple than that.

154
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,429
The fact is

155
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:11,670
when, when somebody hacks you, it's not like if, if I'm coking your Pepsi,

156
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,980
that Pepsi is gonna hack you from their corporate network.

157
00:06:13,989 --> 00:06:15,660
Right. That's not how this works,

158
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:16,970
you know?

159
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,290
And I think that's what people don't realize. It's not like

160
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,299
if Russia is hacking

161
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:22,700
the

162
00:06:23,429 --> 00:06:26,260
United States, it's really easy to track down an attacker,

163
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:29,290
which is truth, the attacker is really not savvy.

164
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,820
But if the attacker is that not savvy,

165
00:06:32,109 --> 00:06:36,899
-- chances are their attacks not going to be successful.
-- Right. Exactly. Exactly.

166
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,760
Or it's, it's the kind of thing where it's like, I'm sorry, but, you know,

167
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,700
somebody just randomly emails corporate execs saying

168
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:44,820
please pay this invoice to this bank account

169
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:45,859
and then,

170
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,500
and then what do you do? You hack them back? Like I know, let's hack the bank, right?

171
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,130
It's the bank's fault. Let's, let's get that.

172
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,890
Well, that actually raises a good point.

173
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:55,149
You know what if the attacker uses some offshore

174
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,929
bank to transfer millions of dollars out and,

175
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,220
and that's part of where this whole hacking thing then really starts to fall apart.

176
00:07:00,325 --> 00:07:02,505
Ignoring, let's ignore the fact. It's a terrible idea.

177
00:07:02,515 --> 00:07:06,214
But let's, let's just for a moment, think about the practicalities of it. Right?

178
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:06,535
Like

179
00:07:06,725 --> 00:07:11,144
what, you know, the, the most recent bill talks about not hitting intermediaries.

180
00:07:11,154 --> 00:07:13,515
Ok, good. So, like I'm not allowed to hack, you know,

181
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,684
the I SPS between him and me or whatever. Right.

182
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,144
Well, or not, not allowed. It's, it's, it's,

183
00:07:20,644 --> 00:07:22,984
you're not supposed to, you're supposed to avoid that,

184
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:23,725
you know.

185
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:28,125
Um, so, yeah, what if the end point is a bank and I want to get my money back from them

186
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:29,269
then I guess

187
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,549
I, I guess

188
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:32,829
that that seems to be the answer,

189
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,239
-- you know,
-- and of course, my favorite scenario in all of this is, you know, um, ok,

190
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,230
who's, there's Coke and Pepsi, who's the third one?

191
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,149
Uh, we're going to go with a w root beer.

192
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:41,420
I

193
00:07:41,559 --> 00:07:42,920
think they're separate. I don't know.

194
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,380
But for the sake of argument

195
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,559
a and w root beer is hell bent on world domination.

196
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:50,799
So they break into Pepsi and, or Coke or both

197
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:54,899
and then attack the other one from their corporate network and, you know,

198
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,450
they essentially, you get this like mutually assured destruction,

199
00:07:57,459 --> 00:07:58,890
standoff scenario.

200
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:06,170
Yeah. No, I, I know it. It's kind of like that false flag concept when you're

201
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,100
dealing with espionage,

202
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,679
make things better. Even if it works, it won't make things better.

203
00:08:10,859 --> 00:08:13,769
You know, I think that's really the most important point, isn't it?

204
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:14,489
Is, you're right.

205
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:20,170
Even if, even if the bad guys always attacked from their correct place of origin

206
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:25,630
and even if we could properly attribute this stuff with, with 0%

207
00:08:25,859 --> 00:08:26,709
failure,

208
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,839
-- what is it gonna, it isn't going to fix anything?
-- You're right. Yeah.

209
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:34,039
Well, so best case scenario, let's say you delete all their data, all their backups,

210
00:08:34,308 --> 00:08:36,840
you delete everything they stole and you break their systems.

211
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,044
Cool. But like they can be back up running in 12 hours,

212
00:08:40,313 --> 00:08:42,403
12 hours, like 15 minutes.

213
00:08:42,544 --> 00:08:42,953
Right?

214
00:08:43,443 --> 00:08:46,523
It take a while for the Amazon delivery guy to come back, you know,

215
00:08:46,633 --> 00:08:46,703
new

216
00:08:46,823 --> 00:08:47,374
laptops

217
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:49,294
one hour delivery man. Come on.

218
00:08:49,513 --> 00:08:50,343
-- Yeah.
-- True.

219
00:08:50,684 --> 00:08:51,924
So, you know, and that's the problem. Right.

220
00:08:51,934 --> 00:08:54,763
Is, I think these people are also basing this on the fact that, like,

221
00:08:54,874 --> 00:08:57,223
with traditional sort of crime and war,

222
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,719
when you do an attack, you sort of consume a whole bunch of stuff.

223
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:06,859
Right. And that's not how the whole cyber thing works. That's kind of why,

224
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:13,690
that's the impression I get where I, I feel like these are people trying to apply

225
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:18,700
real world principles to the cyberspace. I see what I did there

226
00:09:18,979 --> 00:09:19,820
to cyber

227
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,619
and,

228
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,770
and they do not understand how things work and like, you know what this is,

229
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,195
what I always think of it. This

230
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,125
is,

231
00:09:28,304 --> 00:09:29,724
is like in the, in the

232
00:09:29,974 --> 00:09:33,804
there's comedy movies and things where they, you know, they, they're like, oh,

233
00:09:33,815 --> 00:09:37,205
you know, I have the file or something, you know, it's like it's not

234
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,554
right or, or, or,

235
00:09:38,885 --> 00:09:43,195
or they, they, they steal the document, you know, it's like I have the only copy.

236
00:09:43,205 --> 00:09:44,974
It's like, no, you don't, you know,

237
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,155
you can't prove that and they probably had backups.

238
00:09:47,174 --> 00:09:48,794
It's just like a man.

239
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,539
It's funny in a comedy movie.

240
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,989
This is real life.

241
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,049
Well, like every time there's like the black male scenario where it's like, OK,

242
00:09:56,059 --> 00:09:58,859
we'll return the, the photos and the negatives,

243
00:09:59,359 --> 00:10:00,789
you can copy negatives,

244
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:04,260
you've been able to do that since forever. It's called a camera.

245
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,539
No, I know. I know. And it like,

246
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,539
oh

247
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,530
anyways

248
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,039
um so yeah, anyways, this whole hack back thing is just such a train wreck. And

249
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,210
I don't think it'll ever get implemented.

250
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,059
Here.

251
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,090
Here's the thing I keep thinking of and let's

252
00:10:19,099 --> 00:10:21,549
ignore the fact that it just can't be implemented.

253
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:21,770
But

254
00:10:22,359 --> 00:10:22,940
-- there
-- are,

255
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:23,119
well,

256
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,650
I think it basically they have to be seen to be

257
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:27,320
doing something and this is a piece of legislation that all,

258
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,919
like, unsophisticated people think that they understand and think is a good idea.

259
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:33,859
So it's, they're seen to be doing something and then when it doesn't pass, you know,

260
00:10:33,869 --> 00:10:37,340
which anybody's policymaker who's clued into their underlings is going to be like,

261
00:10:37,349 --> 00:10:38,700
oh, thank God, it didn't pass.

262
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,940
But they can be like, oh, it didn't pass because Xy and Z those, you know, blah, blah,

263
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:43,859
blah and then, you know,

264
00:10:43,869 --> 00:10:46,260
but they seem to be doing something and they're not on the hook when it

265
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,900
doesn't pass, you know,

266
00:10:48,099 --> 00:10:50,669
-- but you know
-- what, you know what I wonder what if it does pass?

267
00:10:52,369 --> 00:10:55,890
The thing is, it would be so easy to manufacture excuses to hack other people

268
00:10:56,669 --> 00:10:58,679
because by definition, if you're a bad guy,

269
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,260
you're going to hack into that person and then use them to hack into

270
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,909
your legitimate company and then your legitimate company can

271
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:07,400
hack them back for whatever gain and legally legitimate.

272
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,789
-- But
-- then I'm wondering, like,

273
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,479
are there going to be consultancies that set up hack back

274
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:13,669
groups? Like,

275
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:15,679
but those already exist?

276
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:18,109
Like they're just not well known. I mean,

277
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,549
there are groups that will do things that are, you know, questionable legality

278
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:22,159
for money,

279
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:26,900
you know. So those, that, that capability and that, well, let's face it.

280
00:11:26,909 --> 00:11:28,580
Penetration testing. Except,

281
00:11:29,049 --> 00:11:31,549
ok, you're paying us to hack you now you're paying us to hack them

282
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,510
like that. Literally, it's like

283
00:11:34,739 --> 00:11:37,349
please write down the domain name. You want us to hack?

284
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:39,489
Oh, that's not your domain name. 00, ok.

285
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:44,320
I'm gonna need a log file showing that they are, they part scanned you once?

286
00:11:46,395 --> 00:11:49,034
That's the other beauty. Yeah. What do you count as a cyber attack?

287
00:11:49,044 --> 00:11:53,544
Like, like login attempts? Because if I check my SSH logs for login attempts.

288
00:11:53,554 --> 00:11:55,554
Well, I don't see any because it's firewalled. But

289
00:11:55,715 --> 00:12:00,184
if it were open to the world, I would see, I'm assuming 10 to 100 attempts.

290
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:03,695
-- I,
-- I have a system that, that is running SSH D

291
00:12:04,094 --> 00:12:04,775
and

292
00:12:05,215 --> 00:12:08,924
I have it set up so you can only log in with a key

293
00:12:09,409 --> 00:12:13,349
and I've quit reading the log because it's such a train wreck.

294
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:14,700
And I'm like, at the same time,

295
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:18,130
I know there's a million bots trying to log in constantly.

296
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,750
And what am I going to do about it right there. There's nothing I can't. Well,

297
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:22,789
that's right.

298
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:24,909
-- I'll log into their systems because
-- the thing to remember

299
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,599
too is a lot of these devices that are scanning,

300
00:12:26,609 --> 00:12:27,859
for example, remember like the Marai bot

301
00:12:27,969 --> 00:12:31,469
net, you can hack it back and hose them and break them and make the attack go away.

302
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:34,280
But, you know, at what point? Like here's the problem. Right.

303
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,710
A lot of that is gonna,

304
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,799
well, there's the innocent bystander problem of, you know,

305
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:42,590
my IP camera got hacked it in turn, tried to hack other stuff.

306
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:45,750
Somebody went into my IP camera and bricked it. I figured out who it was.

307
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,719
Do I now wish to attack them back?

308
00:12:48,849 --> 00:12:49,260
Right.

309
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,989
Like an eye for an eye and the whole world goes

310
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,169
blind is literally the scenario potentially that we're looking at.

311
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,200
Yes.

312
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:59,059
You know, do I have to go get like a is it like um oh, what are those old things like,

313
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,020
do I have to go to the government?

314
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:04,280
Get like a letter of mark so I can go, you know, be a privateer and like enforce

315
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,500
law in the cyber realm and hack people or you know,

316
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,599
does is just anybody allowed to do this and if comes up in court,

317
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,169
you just have to have some paperwork to show like, hey, look,

318
00:13:13,179 --> 00:13:16,630
here's a bunch of log files I printed out totally legit, you know,

319
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,599
showing that these IP s hacked me because as the other guy,

320
00:13:19,609 --> 00:13:21,159
how do I prove I didn't attack him.

321
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:24,640
I really hope I can register as a cyber privateer,

322
00:13:24,909 --> 00:13:25,500
right?

323
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,890
And we can go after the cyber pirates.

324
00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:33,280
Yeah, I mean, manufacturing fake attacks

325
00:13:33,489 --> 00:13:35,659
is easy in the sense of you just create like

326
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:37,619
you just do a real attack from somebody else.

327
00:13:37,989 --> 00:13:38,909
I know, man,

328
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:42,619
the whole thing is just so bad and like, where does it stop? That's the other thing.

329
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,479
Right. Like, so,

330
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,190
you know, Coke sees Pepsi hacking them, do they then in turn, get to hack

331
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:50,934
Pepsi or are they supposed to go? Like, oh, Pepsi's trying to hack us.

332
00:13:50,945 --> 00:13:52,145
We must have done something bad

333
00:13:53,645 --> 00:13:58,234
and, and. Right. Well, I'm sure history has shown us that feuds always end well.

334
00:13:58,244 --> 00:13:58,755
Right.

335
00:14:00,034 --> 00:14:02,114
And this is one of the biggest arguments for, you know,

336
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,294
the state holding a monopoly on violence

337
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:07,489
is so that the state has the monopoly on violence.

338
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,799
And hopefully things like bureaucracy go slow enough that we don't have, you know,

339
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:14,099
wild excesses of said use of force.

340
00:14:14,109 --> 00:14:14,559
Right.

341
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:20,440
So we'll just, you know, the, the cyber unit of the FBI hack back for us. Right.

342
00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:23,929
Yeah, because if you look at, like, if you go online and look at any of those, like,

343
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,880
online witch hunt things, they almost always go wrong.

344
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,080
They got the wrong person or speak up innocent people or

345
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,909
like the, the Las Vegas shooter thing with the guy's girlfriend.

346
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:36,349
I, you know, I don't know what the deal with that is anymore, but the point is like

347
00:14:37,099 --> 00:14:40,200
that had the potential to go horribly, horribly wrong with some, you know,

348
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,179
crazy person.

349
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,179
Oh, yeah. No, I, I know, I know. Whatever.

350
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:49,799
I guess my, my parting thought here is vigilante justice isn't justice. Right?

351
00:14:49,969 --> 00:14:53,039
Hacking back or whatever. It just the world

352
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:54,039
cannot function

353
00:14:54,835 --> 00:15:00,094
-- in a society run by vigilantes more
-- to the point. It won't make things better.

354
00:15:00,104 --> 00:15:02,895
It would make them at best. Nothing would change.

355
00:15:02,905 --> 00:15:05,184
But the reality is, it would probably make it worse.

356
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,744
It's one of those classic things where it's like,

357
00:15:06,755 --> 00:15:10,804
why are we arguing about whether or not this thing is something that should be done

358
00:15:11,465 --> 00:15:13,505
when it's clear that this thing won't

359
00:15:14,044 --> 00:15:14,625
help,

360
00:15:14,934 --> 00:15:17,965
it won't make things better. Right. That, that's what really frustrates me about.

361
00:15:17,974 --> 00:15:19,424
This whole hack back thing is like,

362
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:24,070
fundamentally, even if you get really awesome legislation and even if you,

363
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,520
like you said,

364
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,909
you get a 0% false positive rate and even if

365
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:29,440
you hack the bejesus out of all these Attackers,

366
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:34,219
-- that's not gonna make a big difference.
-- No, no, it won't matter. And I guess,

367
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,109
well, this is one of the challenges with

368
00:15:37,549 --> 00:15:40,989
anytime you have technology in government I think is

369
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,299
I, I don't know where this is coming from. Exactly.

370
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:47,809
And I don't think anybody really understands, but like this thing just won't die.

371
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,809
It's the same thing with encryption backdoors, right?

372
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:54,190
Like these, these concepts won't die even though they are totally impractical.

373
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,169
And unfortunately, the lawmakers, like, they don't have a clue, they don't know.

374
00:15:58,179 --> 00:15:59,690
-- It is
-- pretty,

375
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:02,679
there are some really sophisticated reasons as to why these

376
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:06,000
things fundamentally don't work because it sounds like on paper.

377
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,849
Ok? You have encryption, that's like a key. Ok? Why can't we have backdoor keys.

378
00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:11,080
Right. Right.

379
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:12,989
Right there. Now for you to

380
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:16,450
unpack that and explain it properly, we, well,

381
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,909
we need another two hour show at least.

382
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:19,460
Right.

383
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,799
You know, I was talking to somebody about signing code and they're like, well,

384
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:24,219
why don't we just automate signing code?

385
00:16:24,229 --> 00:16:26,469
I'm like, yes, we can definitely do that

386
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:29,599
and that will accomplish almost nothing. He's like,

387
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,549
well, Bonobo, we'll have signed code and I'm like,

388
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,640
yes, we will have signed code. But what does that signature mean or represent?

389
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,179
He's like, what do you mean?

390
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:36,520
I'm like,

391
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:40,119
does that signature mean that we've verified the code that we validated it,

392
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:40,789
that we confirmed?

393
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,270
There's no flaws in it. And he's like,

394
00:16:42,599 --> 00:16:45,390
yeah, couldn't we do that? And I'm like, no, because there's too much great,

395
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:46,229
right?

396
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:50,739
You know, like we can't like Ruby gems.org or whatever, pp you know,

397
00:16:50,849 --> 00:16:54,260
50 to 100,000 gems or

398
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:56,599
Python modules or whatever, right? Like,

399
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,380
and even, you know,

400
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:01,479
no offense to all the good security teams that do audit their code.

401
00:17:01,489 --> 00:17:02,299
These guys still have

402
00:17:02,409 --> 00:17:04,520
like open BS D still have security flaws.

403
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:04,670
Oh,

404
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:04,910
yeah.

405
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:06,040
No, there's,

406
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,040
there's never going to be a way around security

407
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:10,079
flaws as long as humans are writing code.

408
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:12,839
I mean, I think that's, that's kind of one of the things you have to,

409
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:13,819
you

410
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,050
-- have to accept, I
-- suspect even with a is and computers writing code,

411
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,540
even with formal proofs

412
00:17:18,969 --> 00:17:21,469
that show the system is correct that also assumes

413
00:17:21,479 --> 00:17:24,390
that the system's purpose and design was correct.

414
00:17:24,969 --> 00:17:26,819
Sure.

415
00:17:26,989 --> 00:17:28,050
You know what I'm saying is you can

416
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:31,109
have semantically correct code that implements a logic problem

417
00:17:31,949 --> 00:17:33,510
or just fundamentally

418
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,800
does something that turns out

419
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:37,239
was a really bad idea.

420
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,880
No, it's, it's certainly a possibility.

421
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:44,079
Yes. Yes. Well, ok. So, you know, you know, what you made me think of here is

422
00:17:44,729 --> 00:17:47,060
I had some, I had some discussions about this.

423
00:17:47,069 --> 00:17:50,709
I was in Germany last week for some meetings and

424
00:17:51,349 --> 00:17:53,670
there were various security topics that, that came up.

425
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,969
And one of the things that kept happening was we would say,

426
00:17:56,189 --> 00:17:58,439
you know, we let's talk about this feature

427
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,599
and co signing is a great example because it's actually one of the features.

428
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:02,410
And then of course,

429
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:07,449
you can pull calls every which way into this idea of why are we signing it and

430
00:18:07,459 --> 00:18:10,060
how are we signing it and how are we protecting keys and what are we doing?

431
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:12,650
And there's like 400 layers to this.

432
00:18:12,969 --> 00:18:17,339
But then, and, and people hated it when I always ask questions,

433
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,270
what's the actual problem we're trying to solve here? Right?

434
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,699
Like what are we actually protecting against?

435
00:18:23,709 --> 00:18:26,060
And I think code signing is a great example where

436
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,619
if the intent is to say, like

437
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:30,699
I built this thing

438
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,459
in my BUILD system,

439
00:18:32,869 --> 00:18:34,300
then you're OK.

440
00:18:34,449 --> 00:18:38,359
And you can say that it doesn't mean it's trustworthy, it doesn't mean it was built,

441
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:38,699
right?

442
00:18:38,709 --> 00:18:40,400
It doesn't mean it doesn't have security issues.

443
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,020
It just means this is the thing I built,

444
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:44,239
right?

445
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,920
Because there are countless examples of people, you know,

446
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:52,079
hacking into code signing systems or back door something before it gets signed or,

447
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:52,880
you know what I mean?

448
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,260
It doesn't solve all the problem

449
00:18:55,829 --> 00:18:56,989
or just buying code signing

450
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:58,810
it solves

451
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,050
a

452
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,300
bad stuff.

453
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,660
And, and this is one of those examples where

454
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,969
you need to really understand what you are doing

455
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:09,719
and what your security solution is actually solving because

456
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,839
it's generally something extremely narrow.

457
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:18,439
But it's easy to think that. Ok, so Josh signed this code. So it's secure.

458
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,739
Like no, no, it is not

459
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,760
in no way. Should you infer that?

460
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,599
But it's also hard to explain to people what that mean.

461
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,229
Well, I mean, we have the same problem with CV E and the, you know, what is a CV?

462
00:19:29,305 --> 00:19:33,755
I mean, well, in theory, it's supposed to mean that this is a vulnerability.

463
00:19:33,935 --> 00:19:35,724
And I mean, to be honest,

464
00:19:35,734 --> 00:19:40,305
we don't always validate every vulnerability as being actually exploitable.

465
00:19:40,314 --> 00:19:45,125
You know, if you come to me and show me a good null point or D ref in the Linux kernel,

466
00:19:45,454 --> 00:19:48,444
my response more often than not is here's your CV E,

467
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:51,324
I'm not gonna make you actually write an exploit code that

468
00:19:51,444 --> 00:19:53,515
exploits it because quite frankly,

469
00:19:53,824 --> 00:19:55,484
that's a total pain

470
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:56,989
and

471
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,609
probably it's possible, you know, it's more to the point,

472
00:19:59,619 --> 00:20:00,640
let's just fix this move on.

473
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,339
-- So how many
-- CV S have exploits, what, maybe 10% maybe.

474
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,709
Uh I think it's like 30 or 40.

475
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,650
-- Oh, really? That's way higher than I expected.
-- Well,

476
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,599
-- not,
-- well, but

477
00:20:11,739 --> 00:20:12,520
you got to remember too.

478
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:14,609
A lot of this is really low hanging fruit,

479
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:16,959
like stuff like cross site scripting exploits

480
00:20:17,219 --> 00:20:18,280
or, you know,

481
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,439
uh The, the definition

482
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:25,849
is like, um, it says it enforces password security X and it does not,

483
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,800
you know, so it's not that there's an exploit per se,

484
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:33,359
but there's like a stated security property that that is then not done.

485
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:34,550
Um

486
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:35,630
Or you know,

487
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,329
the the issue is so trivially exploitable that you don't need exploit code,

488
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:40,089
right? Like

489
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,160
I've had ones where it's like it just

490
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:43,459
like I remember this one,

491
00:20:43,469 --> 00:20:46,430
it's just like it calls this temporary file and runs at his root.

492
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,359
Oops,

493
00:20:48,709 --> 00:20:52,270
that is great. So if that file is present, it'll just get executed

494
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,790
aru you know. Oops.

495
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:58,709
Um Now granted that the scenario for actually exploiting this is pretty tricky but

496
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,459
you know,

497
00:20:59,699 --> 00:21:00,189
um

498
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,099
Yeah, most,

499
00:21:02,109 --> 00:21:05,670
well and a lot of CV S like there's no way we can validate these things because we

500
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,739
don't have access to these commercial products or especially

501
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,390
as we move into like the internet of things.

502
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,119
-- I don't want to have 764 IP cameras in my
-- basement. Super

503
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:16,260
exciting, man.

504
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,130
I

505
00:21:17,369 --> 00:21:20,550
-- think my kids would love that.
-- Here's, here's the bigger part of it though.

506
00:21:20,765 --> 00:21:23,724
And this is actually a really good example is who cares?

507
00:21:23,935 --> 00:21:26,765
Right? Who cares if you can prove it is an exploit or not?

508
00:21:26,775 --> 00:21:28,574
I think just having a reference.

509
00:21:28,824 --> 00:21:31,694
Well, you do want to keep out the noise

510
00:21:31,954 --> 00:21:35,824
because we do actually just now have an example of a researcher who's

511
00:21:35,834 --> 00:21:40,655
spamming hundreds of CV U requests and they are of incredible low quality.

512
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:43,339
The majority are probably garbage.

513
00:21:43,349 --> 00:21:44,640
And when he's asked for more details,

514
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,819
he doesn't come up with them or even the

515
00:21:46,829 --> 00:21:49,050
reference links end up getting deleted and stuff.

516
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,979
So it's pretty clear that this guy is

517
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,390
not doing quality work,

518
00:21:53,589 --> 00:21:54,849
possibly trying to abuse

519
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:55,250
the system.

520
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,540
You know, because that's clearly

521
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:57,810
a

522
00:21:57,989 --> 00:22:00,780
well, exactly. We're just going to ban him until he shapes up

523
00:22:00,989 --> 00:22:03,699
because, you know, in the open source world, my life is a bit easier in that.

524
00:22:03,709 --> 00:22:06,219
I'm like, OK, I don't believe you your request.

525
00:22:06,229 --> 00:22:08,540
So like show me the vulnerable code and explain it

526
00:22:08,729 --> 00:22:09,660
like I'm five.

527
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,250
And if you can't do that, you know, to quote Einstein,

528
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,290
you probably don't understand the problem very well.

529
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,650
I will man, how many people just run like crappy scanner

530
00:22:17,859 --> 00:22:21,239
-- and then copy and paste the results.
-- Oh, it's the worst is not the scanners.

531
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:21,739
It's the fuzz

532
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,180
here. I found this crash exploit.

533
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:27,810
Cool it crashes. Yeah, I have no idea if that's exploitable or not. More the

534
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:29,290
point. I'm not going to figure it out.

535
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,369
I remember when people would do that.

536
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,829
I, I haven't looked at anything like this in years.

537
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:37,020
But when they'd send over, you know, here's 2000 PDF s that crash

538
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:38,280
X PDF.

539
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:42,520
It's like, well, ok, and then they said, well, yeah, these are exploitable.

540
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:42,770
It's like,

541
00:22:42,979 --> 00:22:43,599
no, they're not.

542
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:48,630
Maybe one or two of them are and, and I remember you'd end up with like,

543
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,069
two legitimate bugs

544
00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:51,780
and after, like,

545
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:55,829
the poor people that did the real work and then these bozos would get the credit

546
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,859
that just, they ticked me off to no end.

547
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:00,140
Yeah, that's one reason, I don't know.

548
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,300
I'm kind of on the one hand,

549
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:04,719
I like giving attribution to the person who requested the CV,

550
00:23:04,729 --> 00:23:06,729
because more to the point if there's an issue with the CV,

551
00:23:06,739 --> 00:23:08,270
then you can figure out who asked for it and you can go

552
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,719
poke them with a stick and figure out kind of what happened,

553
00:23:10,729 --> 00:23:11,189
hopefully.

554
00:23:11,869 --> 00:23:16,260
But at the same time there's a reason there's no credit in CV, in the official CV.

555
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,839
Database is because, I mean, that's just not,

556
00:23:19,329 --> 00:23:23,760
it's just that something people do try to gain and it, it will end up being a mess.

557
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:27,650
And part of me too would like to see actually more credit given for the people

558
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:31,079
who came up with the code patch or tested it or actually ship the fix.

559
00:23:31,089 --> 00:23:32,180
Yes, I agree.

560
00:23:32,189 --> 00:23:36,739
Fixing it is the heroes are the ones who are doing the actual fixing in a lot of cases.

561
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,699
Now that said though,

562
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:42,380
I know like when, when project Zero reports issues, they often come with a patch

563
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,260
which is super cool and that's totally the right way to do it.

564
00:23:45,609 --> 00:23:50,000
Well, I mean, implicit, well, the majority of code is not so complicated, but

565
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:54,709
-- once you understand the security flaw, you can't
-- actually, however, I will say so,

566
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:55,339
I've,

567
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:58,459
I've produced many security patches in my day

568
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,199
and I would bet you

569
00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:04,380
less than 10 of them out of probably more than 100 were accepted

570
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:07,800
because in the vast majority of instances I would

571
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:10,219
fix like the security issue because it was missing,

572
00:24:10,229 --> 00:24:12,630
say, you know, a check on a return value or something.

573
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:16,910
When in reality, the problem was somewhere else because it was doing, you know,

574
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,569
some incorrect calculation, three functions up from where I was at.

575
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,890
And that's where actually working with the open source project

576
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,599
is huge because they understand what their application is doing.

577
00:24:25,609 --> 00:24:26,800
Whereas in my case, like

578
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,040
I was seeing

579
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,560
the one line that was causing the problem. That was my obsession.

580
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:33,489
Yeah.

581
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,829
Yeah. And that's fair. And I mean, at least,

582
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,229
uh but like I said,

583
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:40,910
the majority of these fixes are not so complicated or terrible that, you know,

584
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,229
they can't be done by another party.

585
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:44,979
But yeah, it is generally well, and I've also seen ones where they're like,

586
00:24:44,989 --> 00:24:46,550
oh thank you for pointing that out.

587
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,900
The patch is good. But what we're actually going to do is you know, this patch that

588
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,089
also fixes Xy and Z and cleans up the photo.

589
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,030
Definitely,

590
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,150
you know, or the ever classic,

591
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:57,680
we're not going to fix the code.

592
00:24:57,689 --> 00:24:59,630
We're removing that feature because it's a terrible,

593
00:25:01,329 --> 00:25:01,699
like,

594
00:25:02,339 --> 00:25:03,880
assuming you're not using that feature.

595
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:06,199
I've been in a situation where we have a, you know,

596
00:25:06,209 --> 00:25:08,390
had a product that used that feature

597
00:25:08,949 --> 00:25:10,839
so we couldn't just blindly remove it.

598
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,719
Um,

599
00:25:11,869 --> 00:25:13,219
not for a while anyways.

600
00:25:13,719 --> 00:25:17,920
Um, but yeah, so it's, yeah. No, it's, it's, it's definitely tough. So,

601
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:18,640
well,

602
00:25:19,869 --> 00:25:22,130
one thing I did see last week was a

603
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,689
couple of interesting articles on sort of attack detection.

604
00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:30,479
Explain the context here.

605
00:25:31,589 --> 00:25:33,810
So the idea is,

606
00:25:34,229 --> 00:25:38,300
well, let's be blunt, if somebody targets you to hack you, they will win

607
00:25:38,589 --> 00:25:42,069
unquestionably pretty much as long as they have enough budget. Right?

608
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:46,349
If I give you a budget of $7 maybe not to give you a budget of $700,000.

609
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:48,229
Chances are you're gonna get it somehow,

610
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,449
you know, man,

611
00:25:49,709 --> 00:25:51,959
you could go a long way in seven bucks, I bet.

612
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,650
Just saying. Uh,

613
00:25:54,589 --> 00:25:55,969
yeah, it's like three packs of gum

614
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,880
and people. Oh, yeah.

615
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,060
No, people were willing to give up their passwords for candy bars in the UK.

616
00:26:01,069 --> 00:26:03,099
Remember they did that study a few years ago.

617
00:26:04,089 --> 00:26:07,219
Hopefully they get fake passwords. I really do hope. But anyways, um,

618
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,270
so this one was a, it's a,

619
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,739
it's a company that basically makes like a whole bunch of

620
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:16,109
fake sort of end points on your servers and networks.

621
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:19,969
So they make like a whole bunch of fake file shares and stuff like that.

622
00:26:20,209 --> 00:26:22,209
That essentially if they're ever accessed then you

623
00:26:22,219 --> 00:26:24,699
-- know that it's
-- like honey pot type something.

624
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,689
It basically, yeah, it's like automated honey potting.

625
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:30,979
Um, with just the idea being that like, oh, you know,

626
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:34,150
uh your regular users aren't gonna be end map scanning

627
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,010
your network and looking for funky services to connect to,

628
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,489
they're just gonna be trying to get their job

629
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,449
done talking to what they need to talk to.

630
00:26:41,109 --> 00:26:43,689
The Attackers will be the ones, you know, and mapping it and like,

631
00:26:43,949 --> 00:26:46,849
oh, hey, there's something on port 80 here. Let's go poke at it. Right.

632
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:48,130
Yeah.

633
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,900
And then another one that's similar to this is um from Atlassian. It's open source.

634
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,900
And the idea is actually pretty elegant in that.

635
00:26:55,910 --> 00:27:00,380
Uh one of the things people look for nowadays is uh Amazon web service, you know,

636
00:27:00,689 --> 00:27:03,459
um access keys and tokens, right?

637
00:27:04,339 --> 00:27:05,439
Because if you get those,

638
00:27:05,449 --> 00:27:08,469
then you have access to their computer resources and you can run stuff.

639
00:27:09,349 --> 00:27:13,290
And so the idea is you basically create a whole pile of fake and by fake, I mean,

640
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,119
they're actually real

641
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,390
Aws tokens, but they're like attached to an account or a system that essentially

642
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,050
should never be used, right? And then you can use the various

643
00:27:21,479 --> 00:27:23,130
Aws tooling or I guess you could use your own

644
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:28,050
to monitor them for usage and then you scatter these fake keys around your systems,

645
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,119
your code, your say docs

646
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,780
and you know, then if somebody uses those keys,

647
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:38,979
-- you know what part of your system has been breached by a bad guy.
-- I love these ideas.

648
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,849
I think this makes total sense because

649
00:27:42,199 --> 00:27:46,810
let's face it. You're never going to create an infrastructure that's

650
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,369
impervious to

651
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,500
penetration by a bad guy

652
00:27:51,439 --> 00:27:52,040
and

653
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,229
tools like this. Help you understand that?

654
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,910
All right, it's happened guys like time to go.

655
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:01,060
-- Well,
-- it's, it's that motion sensor sort of tripwire idea of, you know.

656
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,109
Yeah, you know,

657
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:06,160
you've been breached and ideally now you have an idea of where and how to some degree,

658
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:07,880
you know, and you can start the, the clean up

659
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:08,949
and removal

660
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:09,849
statistic.

661
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:13,550
The average attacker has something like 300 days before they're detected.

662
00:28:13,729 --> 00:28:15,689
I mean, the number is insane.

663
00:28:16,239 --> 00:28:18,969
Now, granted there's, this is kind of a double edged blade

664
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:21,020
because if you do this,

665
00:28:21,979 --> 00:28:25,439
the bad guys are like, like let's say you implement this, then you say, hey, look,

666
00:28:25,449 --> 00:28:29,400
I I rolled out project spacecraft in my infrastructure like for example, I lass

667
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:33,040
and no doubt has done this. So the bad guys know to watch out for this.

668
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:33,619
Right?

669
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,670
Well, but on the flip side too, that means that maybe they don't use your real

670
00:28:37,089 --> 00:28:39,359
Aws keys to access your real Aws resources.

671
00:28:39,369 --> 00:28:42,800
Maybe it's maybe I'm, I'm not going to say yes or no,

672
00:28:43,229 --> 00:28:46,420
-- but like for example, oh, there's
-- definite overhead with this.

673
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:48,959
That's the biggest thing I'd be worried about is the overhead and

674
00:28:49,219 --> 00:28:52,650
-- if there are false positives
-- and there will be right, there's totally going to be.

675
00:28:53,109 --> 00:28:56,920
But at the same time, I think this is a fantastic idea.

676
00:28:57,099 --> 00:28:58,839
Well, it kind of reminds me of that whole,

677
00:28:58,849 --> 00:29:01,520
that guy that had a system that responded to all spam

678
00:29:02,109 --> 00:29:05,489
and started to use Markov chaining to generate replies and, you know,

679
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,589
suck up these spammers time and that they would, you know,

680
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,369
because like sort of that spammers, you know,

681
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:14,010
the first level is all automated and then as you kind of get deeper and deeper into it,

682
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,250
it gets more and more human, right?

683
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:15,739
Because,

684
00:29:15,949 --> 00:29:16,170
you know,

685
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,130
you're actually talking to a person and trying

686
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,969
to convince them to give up like 100 grand

687
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:22,170
for whatever reason, right?

688
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,069
And luckily most people aren't stupid enough that

689
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:27,650
they'll fall for like automated scripted stuff.

690
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,569
You know, you do need a little bit of a human touch.

691
00:29:29,719 --> 00:29:34,209
So the guy's idea was essentially to have an A I waste spammer time,

692
00:29:35,069 --> 00:29:38,430
you know, by saying, yeah, I'm super interested in this. Tell me more.

693
00:29:38,719 --> 00:29:40,069
OK. That sounds totally awesome.

694
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:42,609
Can you please explain this detail or, you know, whatever, right?

695
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,000
I love that.

696
00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:47,760
-- That's because at
-- some point, the Attackers,

697
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,819
I'm not going to say have infinite resources, but I mean,

698
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:52,260
they have nearly infinite resources sort of on the front end

699
00:29:52,439 --> 00:29:55,349
but on the back end they, they're, they're people just like us.

700
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:56,979
It is true.

701
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,949
You know, it, it kind of reminds me of the whole Wikileaks thing and that,

702
00:30:01,089 --> 00:30:02,280
you know, great.

703
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:05,780
You know, I just got like, how many hundreds of gigabytes of whatever,

704
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,920
of classified stuff?

705
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,560
-- Ok. Now I have to have, like, humans read through them.
-- Uh, speaking of that,

706
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:15,079
did you know that the JFK assassination documents are to be released in

707
00:30:15,229 --> 00:30:17,099
it at the end of October?

708
00:30:17,219 --> 00:30:19,180
Oh the end of October. Yeah, I was wonder when that would

709
00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:22,709
-- happen
-- a couple of days, probably after this comes out and

710
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:24,819
-- think about that
-- man.

711
00:30:24,829 --> 00:30:27,630
And of course, the conspiracy theorist to me says, of course,

712
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,089
they would say that and release some sort of documents that are f

713
00:30:30,949 --> 00:30:31,540
whatever

714
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:33,400
the point being that you know,

715
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:36,819
they're going to release like a mountain of crap and then

716
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:40,260
how are people going to get through it? Right. It's gonna be crazy.

717
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:41,380
-- Well,
-- crowd

718
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:46,060
source, there will be a subreddit dedicated to weeding through these documents.

719
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:47,750
-- Yeah,
-- I don't know. It's,

720
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,180
yeah, the whole thing, I mean,

721
00:30:49,969 --> 00:30:52,910
I would like to think if there was somebody evil and competent

722
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:57,109
enough to actually pull that off in some sort of grand conspiracy sense

723
00:30:57,479 --> 00:30:59,150
that they would probably also be able to

724
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,219
monkey with the documentation and stuff that was

725
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:01,910
after the

726
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:02,170
fact, the

727
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:02,550
reality

728
00:31:02,709 --> 00:31:02,729
of

729
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:03,219
it

730
00:31:03,489 --> 00:31:03,670
is

731
00:31:04,719 --> 00:31:07,060
the human beings cannot keep secrets

732
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,800
right? There is basically nothing

733
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:14,219
that has happened ever in history. That has truly been a secret.

734
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:16,989
Right. It always leaks guarantee.

735
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:17,579
Like

736
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:20,739
if this was an actual conspiracy,

737
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,329
it would have been leaked

738
00:31:22,439 --> 00:31:23,619
years ago.

739
00:31:25,939 --> 00:31:27,699
-- Right.
-- Exactly.

740
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,579
You know,

741
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:32,020
-- I love that one.
-- I love the Michelin Webb fake moon landing

742
00:31:33,329 --> 00:31:34,569
where basically they,

743
00:31:34,579 --> 00:31:37,900
they determine it would cost more to fake the moon

744
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:40,420
landing than it would be to go to the moon.

745
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:42,020
Yeah.

746
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,949
Well, probably would cost more because you have to pay off so many people

747
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:50,339
that I read some guy did this analysis of the moon landing and basically said,

748
00:31:50,439 --> 00:31:54,099
like the technology to fake this literally did not exist

749
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,020
in 1969. Like,

750
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:59,500
even if you had infinite money, you couldn't have done it.

751
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,119
There was just no way.

752
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:02,500
It's, yeah.

753
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:03,540
Anyway.

754
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,599
Well, I feel like a lot of security is like that,

755
00:32:05,944 --> 00:32:06,564
you know, like,

756
00:32:06,574 --> 00:32:10,685
like this whole password thing where we're trying to debunk all these, you know,

757
00:32:10,694 --> 00:32:16,214
even the guy who came up with these recommendations is now like, I'm so sorry,

758
00:32:16,224 --> 00:32:17,755
please don't do this

759
00:32:17,905 --> 00:32:20,685
and trying to get that sort of people to wrap their head around it.

760
00:32:20,694 --> 00:32:21,635
Like, ok, you know,

761
00:32:21,645 --> 00:32:24,364
password security is a lot less important than

762
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:27,045
say you having proper two factor authentication,

763
00:32:27,255 --> 00:32:30,165
right? But I, I think about this a lot actually is

764
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,750
we think we can understand password security,

765
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:38,079
something like passwords with lots of characters seems to make sense to us and

766
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:42,329
things like changing your password every two weeks seems to make sense to us.

767
00:32:42,979 --> 00:32:45,910
But the reality is the data proves that's wrong.

768
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:46,560
Right.

769
00:32:46,569 --> 00:32:47,890
And we know that something like

770
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,079
two factor authentication makes probably more difference

771
00:32:51,089 --> 00:32:54,599
in the security for normal people than anything else you can do.

772
00:32:54,609 --> 00:32:55,839
But as security people,

773
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:59,239
we still obsess over all these crazy things that don't really matter and,

774
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:02,160
and the thing I keep coming back to is just the fact that

775
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:07,189
we don't measure anything we do, the vast majority of security is cargo,

776
00:33:07,199 --> 00:33:08,079
cult security.

777
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:08,920
And,

778
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,760
and it's one of those things that let's say you're

779
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:14,119
going to turn on some security feature for your organization,

780
00:33:14,329 --> 00:33:15,390
find a metric,

781
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,800
measure it before you do it and then measure it after you do it

782
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:22,359
and look if, if it doesn't help, like you have to be willing to give up.

783
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:24,199
And I think we suck at that.

784
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,430
Well, great example is in Canada.

785
00:33:26,449 --> 00:33:29,569
Um What do you think our laws are like around uh disclosing data breach?

786
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:30,560
Do you have laws?

787
00:33:31,989 --> 00:33:33,050
Correct?

788
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:37,270
-- Yes,
-- that is the correct answer.

789
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,810
That's voluntary, self

790
00:33:39,949 --> 00:33:42,810
-- reporting.
-- We all know has never failed society

791
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:43,750
ever once.

792
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:44,589
Yeah,

793
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:46,739
because we're just going through a bit of a stink right now where a

794
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:50,670
bunch of uh people are beginning to realize that a lot of companies like,

795
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,780
for example, well, TD uh bank

796
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,750
has started outsourcing things like the fraud

797
00:33:56,979 --> 00:33:57,630
to

798
00:33:57,739 --> 00:34:01,430
people in foreign countries, like the uh the, the, the fraud, um

799
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,160
uh detection office and dealing with fraud.

800
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:08,340
You know, as a customer, traditionally, you dealt with people in Canada,

801
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:10,260
but of course, call center people.

802
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:13,438
Well, I hate to say it, but chances are, you know, we're chasing that

803
00:34:13,938 --> 00:34:16,168
dollar down to the bottom of the barrel. So

804
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:20,688
that stuff's being outsourced, you know, to, um, I think it was in this case, India

805
00:34:21,658 --> 00:34:24,108
and of course, t D's response is, well,

806
00:34:24,118 --> 00:34:26,678
in our cardholder agreement and in all these agreements,

807
00:34:26,728 --> 00:34:30,518
we do have that your data may be processed in foreign countries.

808
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:31,059
And of course,

809
00:34:31,228 --> 00:34:34,339
as a consumer, I can't make a truly informed decision because I, I,

810
00:34:34,349 --> 00:34:38,319
-- if I had to guess I would say all of these contracts,
-- say that.

811
00:34:38,388 --> 00:34:39,618
Yeah, that phone book,

812
00:34:40,049 --> 00:34:44,408
what did I just do the other day? I, I don't even remember now.

813
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:46,599
It was, I was using some service

814
00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:50,050
and they made me, it was one of those scroll to the bottom before you can hit,

815
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,750
accept sort of things that I remember.

816
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,469
It was like,

817
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,679
it must have been

818
00:34:53,978 --> 00:34:55,969
100 pages and I'm like,

819
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:59,590
no human is going to read this.

820
00:34:59,729 --> 00:35:01,840
I remember that like I couldn't and paste some of

821
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,110
them into word docs just to see what was like,

822
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,229
how big it was.

823
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,790
Yeah, 100 pages or 100 screens

824
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:13,389
come on. Nobody even lawyers probably give up after a little while.

825
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,540
Here's the best part.

826
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,830
I also got a credit card from another bank.

827
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:18,939
Never actually signed anything.

828
00:35:18,949 --> 00:35:22,510
I was mailed a copy of the cardholder agreement that basically said by like,

829
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,629
using this credit card, you agree to this, you know,

830
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:28,280
it was like five or six pages of really tiny print.

831
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,590
But I actually never s like, physically signed anything because I was like, I,

832
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,139
I remember leaving the bank and getting home and I'm like, wait a minute.

833
00:35:36,149 --> 00:35:38,669
Oh, I gotta go back and sign something. Right, Because

834
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,929
that's usually how bank stuff works, right? You sign things.

835
00:35:42,429 --> 00:35:42,979
So,

836
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,550
yeah. Well, apparently not anymore.

837
00:35:47,149 --> 00:35:49,820
So, yeah, I mean, this whole thing is like,

838
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:52,739
how am I supposed to have really informed consent?

839
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:53,909
Especially when. Yeah, I mean,

840
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,889
you know, what did that guy point out?

841
00:35:55,899 --> 00:35:56,090
Like,

842
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,129
if you actually hired a lawyer to read through all

843
00:35:58,139 --> 00:35:59,909
the agreements you deal with on a daily basis,

844
00:35:59,919 --> 00:36:01,689
it would be tens of millions of dollars.

845
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,530
So,

846
00:36:03,139 --> 00:36:03,790
yeah, I don't know.

847
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,250
I don't know what the takeaway for this show is

848
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,800
other than maybe looking into stuff like space crab.

849
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:09,439
Which awesome name, by the way.

850
00:36:09,629 --> 00:36:11,110
Yeah. No, it is. I agree.

851
00:36:11,139 --> 00:36:14,689
Um, and like those decoy servers, you know, the other thing I always love was, uh,

852
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:16,679
like Decoy records in the database,

853
00:36:16,969 --> 00:36:17,189
right?

854
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:19,300
You have Decoy records in the database and then have your,

855
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,159
uh I DS system looking out for,

856
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:26,770
you know, the, whatever alphanumeric strings and stuff or 123 F street.

857
00:36:26,889 --> 00:36:28,600
Because, yeah, I think fundamentally at this point.

858
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:31,100
It's, it's more about like if you can,

859
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,830
like if you can detect,

860
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:34,899
uh you may not

861
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,389
detect the attack. But for example, if you can detect the data x filtration

862
00:36:39,659 --> 00:36:42,209
in near real time and then ideally block it,

863
00:36:42,709 --> 00:36:44,810
hey, that's, well as eco

864
00:36:44,919 --> 00:36:46,750
facts learned, that would have been a good thing.

865
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,899
Yeah. No kidding, man.

866
00:36:49,149 --> 00:36:49,159
Oh,

867
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,399
I know. I know exactly what you mean.

868
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:55,810
May maybe that, that's where we ended is, is what the parting thought of the fact that

869
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:59,570
we spend a lot of time obsessing over

870
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,100
making things right?

871
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,659
And making it Impenetrable when in reality, I suspect detection

872
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,709
and, and what's the old saying? Like an ounce of prevention?

873
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:10,780
It's worth a pound of cure or something.

874
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,659
But in reality,

875
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,820
uh prevention

876
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:15,469
is going to fail us.

877
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:18,000
Whereas detection is something we,

878
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:20,899
we do understand and we know we can do something with it.

879
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:21,580
So,

880
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:23,699
-- yeah, I, I, well,
-- remediation,

881
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:24,540
I mean,

882
00:37:24,969 --> 00:37:28,600
you know, um most buildings either have a, you know, well,

883
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:31,189
most buildings now by code have a sprinkler system, right?

884
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:33,060
We don't want to burn them down, but

885
00:37:33,179 --> 00:37:34,179
it happens.

886
00:37:34,389 --> 00:37:36,189
No, I agree. I agree. You know.

887
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:40,030
All right, cool, man. I'm gonna, I'm gonna call it. So, thank you, Kurt. Thank you
