Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 70 with myself,

1
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,319
Kurt Siegfried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:11,329 --> 00:00:12,079
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:18,430
So, did you hear that Minix is now the most deployed operating system in the world?

4
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,129
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

5
00:00:21,139 --> 00:00:24,799
Although I'm wondering if, what's that real time thing from Japan called Tron?

6
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:29,049
-- I thought that was on more embedded systems.
-- It might be, I don't know. This is,

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,889
but no, definitely mics. I mean, the fact that it's on,

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,909
um, well, I guess every piece of Intel hardware in the last,

9
00:00:35,919 --> 00:00:37,970
-- the
-- last couple of years it sounds like.

10
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:42,549
-- Uh, no, because Intel me came out in 2008. Yeah. But
-- I don't, didn't run

11
00:00:42,669 --> 00:00:44,110
mics at first. I don't know.

12
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,759
-- Did
-- they rewrite it to run?

13
00:00:45,889 --> 00:00:48,830
I would assume they just pick something and went with that. Maybe

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,970
-- it's, who knows?
-- Regardless.

15
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:53,939
Or maybe they wrote something themselves and went, wow, that was terrible.

16
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:54,849
And then they went to mic

17
00:00:55,169 --> 00:00:56,709
-- that,
-- that could be. It's,

18
00:00:57,009 --> 00:00:59,790
that's crazy. I mean, where do we even start with this?

19
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:03,869
Like, what is Minix, what is in until me? How does this work? Why do we care?

20
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,410
There's just,

21
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,230
oh, man.

22
00:01:05,919 --> 00:01:08,059
So for some context, I mean, Minnix

23
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:09,540
came before Linux,

24
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:11,480
right?

25
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:17,819
So, Minnix is like your great, great, great grandfather basically in UNIX terms,

26
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:21,940
you know, it's not the origin but it's very close to the origin.

27
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:22,779
Yeah. Yeah.

28
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:23,779
And, and Linux,

29
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:28,879
-- I think, could trace a dotted line. It's a
-- direct descendant. Uh,

30
00:01:29,199 --> 00:01:30,459
and, and sort of,

31
00:01:30,809 --> 00:01:32,860
um, well, it was a direct response to Linux.

32
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:35,500
Yeah. His first email.

33
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,059
I'm working on a Minix clone. That's true.

34
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,379
That's true. Like it's straight up like

35
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,110
it's, it's, I don't know, the mutant offshoot of

36
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:45,139
MX, basically

37
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:46,430
offshoot.

38
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:47,989
Uh

39
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Yes,

40
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,120
I would agree with that 100%.

41
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,339
So.

42
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,930
Yeah. No. So, I mean, the beauty of mini is, it's, it's a very

43
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,120
old,

44
00:01:57,419 --> 00:01:58,690
well understood,

45
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:02,419
you know, very well architected, very well built, little like,

46
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,150
and with emphasis on little operating system.

47
00:02:05,669 --> 00:02:10,258
Um And apparently Intel, uh actually even got the memory footprint much,

48
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,059
much lower,

49
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,380
which, you know,

50
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:14,559
matters if you're making like a billion devices and you

51
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,500
can save like a couple megs of memory that,

52
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,110
-- that
-- does happen, even saving a couple megs of memory.

53
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:22,570
I mean, this is essentially like a hidden secret operating system.

54
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,500
You need to keep it small and you need to keep it out of the way.

55
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:28,059
Um And then of course,

56
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,740
like all pieces of software turns out it's a flaming pile of garbage.

57
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:31,740
That's,

58
00:02:32,029 --> 00:02:33,259
we'll get to that.

59
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,830
I, I know. Anyway. Anyway. So,

60
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:39,910
so I guess to add to this pile,

61
00:02:40,089 --> 00:02:42,399
it became clear

62
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:46,630
in, in recent weeks, we'll say, because this has kind of been building

63
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:47,910
that

64
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,119
Intel has taken minutes.

65
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:54,589
They've made it very tiny and they're running it inside of

66
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,039
every one of their CP US as what we call the,

67
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,070
the Intel Management engine.

68
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:02,639
And the idea is

69
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,399
people want the ability to

70
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:09,660
conduct certain management operations on systems.

71
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,679
And

72
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:14,009
if the system is powered off or sometimes even

73
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,289
you could have a system that's doing something,

74
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:16,570
I,

75
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,800
I don't know that that the operating system is incompatible or

76
00:03:19,809 --> 00:03:21,550
you just don't want to muck with the operating system,

77
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:22,070
-- you
-- can use.

78
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:23,440
Great example being um

79
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,199
I had some as

80
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,940
I motherboards and if you wanted to update the bio,

81
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,500
you had to run a Windows utility.

82
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,320
There is a story that

83
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,860
although I, I think it was a think pad, I had at one time, they distributed a

84
00:03:36,529 --> 00:03:38,160
like a flash drive image.

85
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:40,440
You could just dump onto a flash drive and then boot off

86
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:43,220
-- of it and it updated the firmware which is
-- really the free do

87
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:44,669
based one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

88
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,100
There were some that did a free dos based one which was nice because yeah,

89
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,100
you just dumped.

90
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:48,949
Yeah, you

91
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:49,369
boot

92
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:51,630
-- image boop. Done.
-- Right. Right. It was cool.

93
00:03:52,179 --> 00:03:54,720
But obviously that doesn't scale when you have 10,000 workstations and

94
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:55,910
it does not.

95
00:03:56,089 --> 00:03:59,330
And, and so I guess this is the intent of the management engine.

96
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,869
But the, the downfall being

97
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,690
you now have what is essentially a,

98
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:08,600
a super amazing back door into every system running at

99
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:12,470
what we call ring minus three. That seems to be what the term I read.

100
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,769
But basically if you think of ring zero as super user ring minus one is like the bios

101
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,950
ring minus three is the, yeah, nobody knows I'm here

102
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:24,368
and I can, you know, it's, it's like existing in the fourth dimension, right?

103
00:04:24,378 --> 00:04:26,569
-- You can manipulate the third dimension.
-- Yeah.

104
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:31,009
Well, and it has like wake on L A capability and stuff so that it can like, you know,

105
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:34,248
you can talk to it over, you can basically talk to a dead computer

106
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:38,009
over the network and tell it to update its bios, which is pretty freaking amazing.

107
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:38,128
And,

108
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:38,459
and the

109
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:40,669
point that is a feature people need,

110
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:41,408
right?

111
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:44,128
Like you think about like a university with 10,000 machines,

112
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:45,498
you want to do bios updates,

113
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,069
right?

114
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:48,009
You can just put them all out at 3 a.m.

115
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,859
And this is the fundamental problem with all

116
00:04:49,869 --> 00:04:52,170
these orchestration products like in the cloud,

117
00:04:52,179 --> 00:04:52,950
for example, you know,

118
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,989
you need to be able to control and manage this stuff at scale.

119
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:02,059
But that means that your control and management system is now a huge,

120
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,869
-- huge
-- risk. Well, and what really is annoying. A lot of people is

121
00:05:07,059 --> 00:05:09,880
you can't turn off intel me

122
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:10,609
it's just,

123
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:13,890
well, it's complicated but we'll say fundamentally you can't

124
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,880
normal people can't turn it off

125
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:18,720
even you. And I would probably struggle with it. I did,

126
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:20,529
I probably brick the machine.

127
00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:21,809
Yeah, probably

128
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,779
something like apparently Google is seriously looking at

129
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,200
uh getting like replacing.

130
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:29,279
Well, and here's the thing,

131
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,160
even if you want to replace the intel me stuff with say Linux,

132
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,440
which is something that Google and some other people are working on.

133
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,079
We'll put a link to this really great slide deck in the show notes

134
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,119
even then you can't sort of completely get rid of intel. I

135
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,000
because it also handles some of the hardware initialization

136
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,450
stuff that you kind of can't live without.

137
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:48,829
You know.

138
00:05:48,989 --> 00:05:49,630
So

139
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,470
yeah,

140
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,769
it's just one of those little, well, I, I think what it boils down to now is

141
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,440
almost everything with software now has a web server

142
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:05,010
and the tell me is like no exception, right? It has remote management. You can log in.

143
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:08,000
Apparently the default credentials are admin, admin. So

144
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:09,480
that's, that's good.

145
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:12,269
Well, and what else would they be?

146
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:17,420
Would they, you know, I mean, they could have in theory made each one different. Um

147
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,160
you know, like for example, my cable or not my cable modem.

148
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:24,750
Uh Well, actually both my cable modem and my DS L modem both come

149
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,230
with a unique

150
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,709
uh Wi Fi password and a unique like admin login.

151
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:32,059
So, you know, at some point,

152
00:06:32,179 --> 00:06:35,760
either my ISP or the original manufacturer, I assume it's my ISP

153
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,459
like flash these things to get them, you know, ready to go.

154
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:42,619
And I was part of that process, you know, gave each one a unique password and whatnot.

155
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:48,829
Um, but again that, you know, when you're making CP US in the terms of millions,

156
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:50,339
you know,

157
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:54,140
are you going to put a sticker on CPU saying the password for the Me on this thing is X,

158
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:55,630
well, if,

159
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:58,049
yes, I get what you're saying,

160
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,010
it's a huge

161
00:06:59,119 --> 00:06:59,220
scale

162
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,529
of

163
00:06:59,670 --> 00:06:59,690
it.

164
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:00,519
Yeah.

165
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:04,799
And this has always been the issue is management and scale. And

166
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:09,140
anyway, I guess it's interesting

167
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,339
that it's open source.

168
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:12,339
It's

169
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,500
interesting

170
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:17,779
that it's running on everything and, you know, it's not going to be secure.

171
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:23,230
-- Well, it's, it's BS D so it's a BS D license. So it is an open source.
-- It's

172
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:24,859
Apache two, isn't it?

173
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:27,390
Uh Well,

174
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:29,130
regardless the point is Intel doesn't have to

175
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,279
release the changes that they made in house,

176
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,059
right?

177
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,700
Like they would have, for example, the GP L you'd be able to, you know,

178
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:37,209
write to them and demand a CD with the source code for this thing

179
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,160
uh or whatever, right?

180
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,839
Where, whereas with the minix license, they can make in-house changes,

181
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,660
distribute those binaries and be like, yep, that secret sauce go away.

182
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:51,859
So, um although apparently they did push back um some changes and they did, you know,

183
00:07:51,869 --> 00:07:54,100
they actually did help Minix improve, you know, with,

184
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:54,899
like I said,

185
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:58,290
minimizing the memory footprint and some other changes to make it more modular.

186
00:07:58,429 --> 00:08:00,470
But, yeah, fundamentally, I mean, here's the reality. Right.

187
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,910
It's software so it's flawed.

188
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,619
-- Of course, it's flawed
-- regardless of things like admin,

189
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,130
admin for the password user name.

190
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:07,579
Right.

191
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,850
I, I just looked, it's BS D license which not that it matters.

192
00:08:10,859 --> 00:08:11,880
They're all basically the same.

193
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:12,769
Which,

194
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:13,660
yeah,

195
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:16,299
send your, send your licensing complaints to Kurt.

196
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:17,869
I

197
00:08:19,429 --> 00:08:19,760
know. But

198
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,739
I just said they're all the same and they're totally

199
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,980
anyway.

200
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:24,540
Right.

201
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:30,820
And I guess the other beauty of this is now that people know it's there and

202
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:34,340
they, they, they know what it is. They're going to dump it. It,

203
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,070
it is going to happen. Uh,

204
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,460
did they dump the O si don't,

205
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:42,058
I know that they've connected to the J tag essentially of it.

206
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:42,619
But

207
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,520
they, they did dump the OS.

208
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,590
Somebody claimed to have dumped it.

209
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:47,530
-- I thought
-- I,

210
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:52,010
I've only heard rumors and we've seen a demo of

211
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:56,289
using a USB device to connect to the management engine,

212
00:08:56,299 --> 00:08:56,919
which is,

213
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,729
that's kind of also crazy in its own. Right? Because

214
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,000
basically

215
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,599
you have this thing wired up.

216
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:05,489
So anything that plugs into a USB port has the ability

217
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,969
to talk to the secret operating system running in your processor.

218
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:11,859
Ok. That's neat.

219
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:13,440
Yeah.

220
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:18,099
No, my understanding was that while they claim to have dumped the Emmy a few days ago.

221
00:09:18,109 --> 00:09:19,169
Eighth of November.

222
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,419
Um, II, I mean, I don't know that it's been completely confirmed but

223
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,020
it's a matter of time.

224
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:29,260
It's, if they haven't done it. It will happen at some point.

225
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:32,099
Oh, yeah, it's totally going to happen and then they're going to look at it

226
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,820
and I'm sure people are going to find problems.

227
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:36,380
Right. It's, it's inevitable

228
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,179
and, well, and here's, here's kind of the other part of this.

229
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:43,059
I wonder is, I wonder how difficult it's going to be to update that thing

230
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,260
to make sure

231
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,130
it's not.

232
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,489
Well, yes, but micro

233
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:49,739
code is applied at boot time.

234
00:09:50,099 --> 00:09:53,530
So if you have this thing off listening for wake on land,

235
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:57,580
you conceivably have an exploit vector that you can't stop.

236
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:02,080
So I would hope they have a way to actually flash what's inside the chip, right?

237
00:10:02,289 --> 00:10:05,510
My understanding is the Intel management engine can be updated.

238
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,719
Uh Yeah, it says here.

239
00:10:07,849 --> 00:10:10,799
Uh Yeah, because Intel ships updates for the Me.

240
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,609
-- Now, do you have to install them or do they magically
-- update? Oh, it's like a bio

241
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,489
update basically is my understanding.

242
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,090
I inspect that. Yes.

243
00:10:20,729 --> 00:10:21,559
So this would also

244
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:26,950
because there was a, there was a thing a few a month or two ago, there was a CV E

245
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:32,919
for a security flaw in the Intel me stuff that we didn't quite understand.

246
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:35,840
Um And basically it was to prevent rollback attacks.

247
00:10:35,849 --> 00:10:38,969
So once once essentially once you update the Intel Amy,

248
00:10:38,979 --> 00:10:41,849
you're not supposed to be able to roll it back to an earlier version,

249
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:46,679
which would really make sense in the context. Now, of what we know about the intel, ay

250
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,250
and having said this, they'll probably never,

251
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,380
ever hire me and put me on some blacklist along with you.

252
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,479
-- Uh, that's
-- ok.

253
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,169
Yeah,

254
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:58,280
we're not knocking them necessarily. We're just pointing out the irony of all this.

255
00:10:58,789 --> 00:11:02,039
Well, I mean, the problem is we need management at scale and

256
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,080
-- doing truly secure management at scale
-- is impossible.

257
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,239
-- It's not hard, it's impossible, let's say, well,
-- it's,

258
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,510
it's

259
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,880
-- doing, it cost effectively. It's
-- impossible

260
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,700
and securely is impossible. I mean,

261
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:15,679
no cost,

262
00:11:15,974 --> 00:11:17,174
they had nothing to do with it.

263
00:11:17,294 --> 00:11:19,794
If I gave you all of the money in the world and said,

264
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,684
build a completely secure management engine

265
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:26,494
at best, you could embezzle the money and run off to a foreign country,

266
00:11:26,635 --> 00:11:30,965
-- for
-- example, some high value items kind of have these like satellites, for example,

267
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,244
you know, satellites are a high value item,

268
00:11:33,455 --> 00:11:34,534
but the thing is there,

269
00:11:34,544 --> 00:11:36,875
we're talking something that costs a couple 100 million bucks.

270
00:11:36,885 --> 00:11:40,474
So yeah, spending, you know, a million dollars on a secure update

271
00:11:40,744 --> 00:11:42,635
system for it totally worth it.

272
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,000
Um, now obviously for Intel, you know, at scale it would,

273
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,159
it would

274
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:47,700
average

275
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:49,919
like a penny per unit or whatever, but still

276
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:53,400
it, it would just be so much overhead and customers would hate it. Right? Because,

277
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,530
you know,

278
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:57,989
imagine you buy like you buy 1000 systems from Dell and it's kind of like great.

279
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,820
Now, Dell, what's like we need the me passwords for these things and Dell's like, oh,

280
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,280
right.

281
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,200
Uh, we, whatever

282
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,229
that's, you know, extra or,

283
00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:09,080
you know, here's a, here's a printout. Good luck with that. You know,

284
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,890
like, it's just, they're so, like doing,

285
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,609
you know, it always reminds me of things like the, we've just,

286
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:19,229
we've built a world where, for example, like, there's

287
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,710
hundreds of millions of people running the same web plugins, like ad blockers.

288
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:25,169
And God forbid those ad blockers ever turn malicious.

289
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,900
It wasn't there an issue where one of them was,

290
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:30,150
their

291
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:34,409
system got compromised and they, they distributed a compromised uh

292
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:35,659
uh

293
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:41,140
thing for uh it was like four or five days and then Google,

294
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,609
I think blocked it or they updated it or whatever.

295
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,320
Um,

296
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:47,369
but I mean, that's, you know, that's part of the thing, right? Is like, I mean,

297
00:12:48,619 --> 00:12:52,070
you know, 10 years ago when smart, well, 11 years ago when smartphones came out

298
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:55,530
right now we're at what I think is 3 billion smartphones globally.

299
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,690
There's a lot,

300
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,299
you know, so that's like 3 billion computers sitting in people's pockets

301
00:13:01,669 --> 00:13:02,950
which are not getting updates for.

302
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,820
There was actually a new story I saw today that said

303
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:11,020
1 billion Android phones are like hopelessly out of date.

304
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,580
A billion.

305
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,219
I totally believe that it's terrible.

306
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:19,059
Well, again, the reality is the economics of it.

307
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,500
You know, somebody sold that phone, why would they support it?

308
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,390
You already gave them your money. What are you going to do? Return it?

309
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,659
Well, this is even true.

310
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:29,859
I mean, this is part of the story of kind of this Intel Management engine. Right. So

311
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,450
they take open source

312
00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:34,349
and they put it in their product and there's nothing wrong with it.

313
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:37,330
But now the question kind of becomes, are they paying attention to it?

314
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,669
Are they updating it? Do we know what's in it? Are they building it securely?

315
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:41,900
They've been shipping Intel

316
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:46,030
-- em, me, updates on a pretty regular basis for the last few years.
-- And that is good.

317
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,440
And I'm glad they are.

318
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:50,789
So, they definitely have engineering resources behind this thing.

319
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:52,150
It's not being ignored.

320
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,349
And, and I mean, in Intel's case,

321
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:58,179
I know a lot of Intel people and I'm confident they're going to do this the right way.

322
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,479
But for every Intel,

323
00:14:00,489 --> 00:14:04,179
there are probably 1000 other companies that don't really care.

324
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,659
Well, all of the IOT

325
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:06,200
space.

326
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:08,309
Right. Right. And that was outside

327
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,460
-- of a
-- few players.

328
00:14:09,729 --> 00:14:12,909
There was, there was another story I read, I forget who even wrote this.

329
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:13,530
It might have been Schneer

330
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:14,500
Krebs.

331
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,840
But they basically point out the fact that like

332
00:14:16,849 --> 00:14:19,299
the IOT is never going to be secure because

333
00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:21,140
let's face it if you walk into the store

334
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:24,479
and there's a $400 toothbrush and there's a $4 toothbrush

335
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,340
and,

336
00:14:25,349 --> 00:14:27,719
and the $400.01 has security and that's the only

337
00:14:27,729 --> 00:14:30,169
difference you're going to buy the $4 toothbrush.

338
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:30,539
Right.

339
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:35,260
I mean, just end of story and, and it's even the same deal with these chips and stuff is

340
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:40,590
so Intel makes a chip and let's say they decide like, screw it. We don't care anymore.

341
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:42,520
We're just never gonna update Intel. I me.

342
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,460
Well, what do you do now? Right.

343
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,099
Nothing. You're gonna stop buying Intel chips.

344
00:14:47,109 --> 00:14:48,780
No, you're gonna keep buying them and,

345
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:51,229
and actually that's another interesting story is

346
00:14:51,549 --> 00:14:55,659
what happened. I mean, not that, not that I hope it happens very often.

347
00:14:55,669 --> 00:15:00,020
But what happens if people have like 10 year old CP US? Are those gonna get updates?

348
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,989
-- Um, who knows?
-- I mean, I,

349
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:03,309
I,

350
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,429
I, I generally,

351
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,059
the good news is,

352
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:11,210
uh, here's one of the best pieces of news ever for this security thing

353
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,309
is that

354
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,429
most modern hardware is so much more

355
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,909
like energy efficient person basically work unit,

356
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:18,049
right?

357
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:18,950
Because either the,

358
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:23,530
it's a lot faster or, you know, it can do more instructions per cycle or for example,

359
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:25,030
like SSD store,

360
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,450
you know, um,

361
00:15:27,099 --> 00:15:30,090
they store data at an energy cost.

362
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:34,219
Like, what is it like 0.05 watts compared to a spinning hard drive at like five watts,

363
00:15:34,229 --> 00:15:34,369
right?

364
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:34,640
That

365
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,320
essentially there's a huge incentive

366
00:15:37,619 --> 00:15:40,359
for most large scale operators to upgrade their

367
00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:42,919
hardware every couple of years because it just,

368
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:46,119
it, like my understanding is like S sds in the data center

369
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,570
basically pay for themselves in like 6 to 12 months because of the

370
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:50,440
cost

371
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:55,880
or that's like, actually I remember when flat screen TV, S came out

372
00:15:56,359 --> 00:16:01,349
and the power use was substantially less than AC RT. And I did the math once

373
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:03,929
and realized that by even if you only watch your

374
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,919
TV for something like two or three hours a day,

375
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:10,109
it basically a flat panel paid for itself in something like a year.

376
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,190
Well, I remember mentioning

377
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,250
to you, my parents' cabin has like a 70 AMP feed and you're like, oh,

378
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:15,900
you should upgrade that.

379
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:18,530
And I'm like, why? Well, literally

380
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,609
the only thing we have that uses power there is like the coffee maker in the microwave

381
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:25,510
and then like we plug in some tablets that draw,

382
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,770
I don't know, 20 watts.

383
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:31,450
Yeah, but you probably can't run the microwave and coffee maker at the same time,

384
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,590
which could be dangerous.

385
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,809
Yeah. Well, it's, we just got to get up early.

386
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:36,880
But, um,

387
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:41,349
I mean, fundamentally like, II, I look in my house now and I was uh

388
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,359
thinking, you know, do I need to upgrade the wiring here?

389
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:45,909
And the answer is no, because we

390
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,219
apart from like the stove in the microwave,

391
00:16:48,229 --> 00:16:50,229
we don't have anything that draws a lot of power anymore.

392
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,669
I've actually, I don't have desktops anymore.

393
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,309
Well, I have two Mac minis and that's it.

394
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,250
But I guess the Mac minis are, you know, my quote

395
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,659
unquote biggest computer,

396
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,159
-- everything else is laptop,
-- a

397
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:00,549
giant computer.

398
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:06,469
It is when I record this podcast on even and it consumes an enormous amount of power

399
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:10,410
because it's got like four hard drives in it and a huge CPU and tons of ra M

400
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,000
-- and a giant
-- video even compared to the old time stuff.

401
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,910
It's still only drawing like 3, 400 watts.

402
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:15,819
Probably.

403
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,540
Here's the thing that's crazy to think about when you and I were kids.

404
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:22,540
-- How many 60 watt light bulbs did your house have?
-- Oh man. Hundreds.

405
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,819
Like everything had a 60 watt light bulb in it.

406
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,010
We just finished buying, like,

407
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,010
we've replaced every single light fixture and light

408
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,660
bulb in this house with one exception.

409
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,800
And, you know, the, the new led light bulbs are like,

410
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,800
quite a bit more expensive than the old timey filament bulbs.

411
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,680
But the thing is I'm going to buy them once and then maybe 2030 years from now

412
00:17:40,689 --> 00:17:43,260
we'll move and then I'll buy a new set of light bulbs for the new place.

413
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:46,400
You need to unless someone hasn't already replaced them all.

414
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:47,069
Yeah.

415
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,189
You know, like these things have lifetimes of like, what, $22,000 or something.

416
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:52,780
And that's the other concern

417
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:56,939
with IOT stuff. Right. People buy a TV, with, you know,

418
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,219
they expect to, to, for five or 10 years.

419
00:17:59,229 --> 00:18:02,770
You know, when I, now, when I buy a light bulb with like a 22,000 hour lifespan,

420
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,969
I'm expecting that thing to run for 10 or 20 years,

421
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,369
you know, and

422
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:10,459
I was tempted to buy some IKEA light bulbs that have, um,

423
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:14,660
uh, their iot light bulbs basically, they either have a remote,

424
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,560
I think it's Bluetooth

425
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,699
or you can control them from a phone app.

426
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,290
And, you know, I've held off on that because I kind of want to see, you know,

427
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,300
security wise.

428
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:26,410
Well, I've heard the IKEA ones are pretty good. I think it's, uh,

429
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:30,479
let's see, Matthew Garrett has been tearing up iot light bulbs

430
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,449
and at some point doing, you know,

431
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:35,410
security analysis and you can imagine they're almost all terrible,

432
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,859
but I'm pretty sure the IKEA ones

433
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:41,689
he didn't say are completely terrible. Right. I'm sure they're not

434
00:18:42,609 --> 00:18:43,170
right.

435
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,660
Less bad. That's,

436
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:46,900
that's as good as they

437
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,329
-- get.
-- There's not completely terrible.

438
00:18:49,339 --> 00:18:50,069
Right. Right.

439
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:53,810
And I, I have a feeling that IKEA cares

440
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,719
-- because,
-- well, they definitely have a brand to protect. Right.

441
00:18:56,729 --> 00:18:58,609
They're not like some fly by night company.

442
00:18:58,619 --> 00:18:59,959
I mean, repainting all those stores,

443
00:18:59,979 --> 00:19:02,410
stores alone would cost several million dollars.

444
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,520
Yes.

445
00:19:04,689 --> 00:19:05,520
That's right.

446
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,239
And the meatballs. Right. Don't forget those

447
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:09,250
delicious,

448
00:19:09,729 --> 00:19:11,199
-- you know, I've never
-- had those.

449
00:19:11,209 --> 00:19:14,739
And at this point I don't think I ever will just to prove a point.

450
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,670
Right. It's, it's like

451
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,119
I've never seen an episode of Silicon Valley

452
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:22,939
and I feel like if I did,

453
00:19:22,949 --> 00:19:25,390
I would be ruining something because I can be like the

454
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,099
guy in the room that says I've never seen that show.

455
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:29,459
I don't know what you're talking about.

456
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:31,709
And then people look at me like there's something wrong with me.

457
00:19:32,219 --> 00:19:35,089
Well, speaking of not knowing what we're talking about.

458
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,050
Have you heard about the other thing Equifax does

459
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,859
they know my salary even though I didn't tell them that. And

460
00:19:44,969 --> 00:19:45,050
yeah,

461
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,400
and how they sell that data for, apparently it's 20 bucks.

462
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:52,199
-- I'm not even a
-- little surprised, man. I mean, look, here's the thing,

463
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:58,089
all of these big data organizations and in this, I'll tie back to the Facebook.

464
00:19:58,439 --> 00:20:00,530
Listens to your microphone thing where

465
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,930
there was, there was an obviously the news story talking about,

466
00:20:03,939 --> 00:20:05,680
oh Facebook listens to the microphone in your

467
00:20:05,689 --> 00:20:08,609
phone and then someone replied eventually and said

468
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:12,719
they don't have to like they know this stuff about you and and I mean,

469
00:20:12,729 --> 00:20:14,680
the Equifax thing is the same deal, right?

470
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,800
Even if they don't know exactly what my salary is,

471
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:20,619
I guarantee they can look at all the data they have

472
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:24,930
and probably get it within like 10 or $20,000 right?

473
00:20:25,469 --> 00:20:29,569
Like this is just, this is the reality of of big data

474
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,479
is

475
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,270
I I remember when

476
00:20:32,709 --> 00:20:36,650
uh what was it? Was it prism where the NSA was caught recording a bunch of con

477
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,699
or no, they weren't recording conversations, they were capturing metadata,

478
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:40,010
right?

479
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,449
That was a big excuse of,

480
00:20:41,459 --> 00:20:43,530
oh it's just metadata and it's I I think

481
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,359
people have come to realize now that thanks to all

482
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:49,449
of these algorithms and all of these storage facilities and

483
00:20:49,459 --> 00:20:53,770
and applications we have now metadata is enormously powerful,

484
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,199
you can take metadata and infer

485
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,300
things with incredible accuracy about people. I

486
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,719
mean, it's crazy and

487
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,000
you know what I love about it all too is,

488
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:05,920
is I look at all this and I think about everything going on and it's like

489
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,609
everything we see

490
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:13,180
all of the thing, all this crazy has been built on the back of open source,

491
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:17,099
right? Like this is never what anyone intended or hoped it would turn into.

492
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,250
And it's like

493
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,609
I feel like this is one of the wishes from

494
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:24,339
a genie I wish open source is used everywhere.

495
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:25,239
It's like poof,

496
00:21:25,489 --> 00:21:26,760
you got your wish.

497
00:21:27,739 --> 00:21:30,500
Well, and part of it too is this is the stuff we currently know about.

498
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,520
-- I'm sure there's even more.
-- Oh, right.

499
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:36,439
Because a place like Equifax is never going to tell you all the data they collect.

500
00:21:36,449 --> 00:21:38,189
I mean, that's part of their power, right?

501
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:41,000
Is, is knowing secret things about people that,

502
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:42,959
that people don't even know about themselves

503
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:45,510
because one thing that just happened in the last week,

504
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,910
that's interesting is so in Canada,

505
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,920
we have what's called cr A Canada Revenue Agency and it it's the tax people,

506
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,589
they just got a federal warrant

507
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:56,020
for paypal

508
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,119
for every

509
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,359
business account holder

510
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:03,000
of Canadian origin on paypal

511
00:22:03,449 --> 00:22:06,290
data from 2014 to 2017.

512
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,229
And it is the full name of every individual or

513
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:10,680
corporation holding a business account that has a Canadian address,

514
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:14,469
the date of birth of each individual holding a business account, the business name,

515
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:15,319
if applicable,

516
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:17,400
the telephone numbers on the or of the

517
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,439
corporation or individuals holding the business account,

518
00:22:19,569 --> 00:22:20,560
the full addresses,

519
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,489
the email address is the social insurance number.

520
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:25,300
And here's the best part,

521
00:22:25,369 --> 00:22:27,959
the total number and value of received transactions for each

522
00:22:27,969 --> 00:22:30,880
calendar year between January 1 2014 and November 10th,

523
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:31,729
2017

524
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:32,520
and

525
00:22:32,979 --> 00:22:34,060
the total number and

526
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:37,359
uh the total number and value of sent transactions

527
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:38,979
uh for the same period. So,

528
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:43,780
because I'm guessing there's a lot of people that thought ha ha I'll use paypal,

529
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:46,989
-- they're an American firm and I'm not going to declare this
-- income.

530
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,189
Well, ok, I see two things. I see hiding income as part of it. But I,

531
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:55,859
if they're, if they're looking for revenue in and out,

532
00:22:55,869 --> 00:22:59,260
they're probably also going to find money laundering as part of that.

533
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:02,349
Yes. Well, and it's curious though, it's just the business accounts right now.

534
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:04,770
It's not personal accounts, right? So when you open up a, a Compal

535
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,979
account, essentially, almost everybody opens up a personal account

536
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,599
and you can upgrade it to a business account,

537
00:23:10,609 --> 00:23:12,260
you have to jump through a couple of hoops, right?

538
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:15,880
You have to prove that you are that business and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, right?

539
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:18,989
Are the higher limits. I don't even know what the difference is.

540
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:22,119
Yeah, there's higher limits and you, well, back in the day you got a bit more.

541
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,630
Um they had some capabilities for businesses

542
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,239
that weren't available on personal accounts.

543
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,900
Um, you know, it was, it was, it was really like, it was really aimed at the, the,

544
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,579
the volume sellers on ebay.

545
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:36,900
-- Right.
-- Right. And, and in fact, that's all I've ever used paypal for was paying.

546
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,069
Oh

547
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:40,579
man, I've got a great story. So, so for Halloween,

548
00:23:40,969 --> 00:23:43,300
I was a rabbit, a white rabbit

549
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:44,260
and

550
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,619
I needed ears.

551
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,699
So

552
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:51,540
I ordered bunny ears off of ebay for $5. Right?

553
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:55,670
And uh they showed up like a week ago because the seller

554
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,630
demanded a signature and I kept missing the postman every time.

555
00:24:00,209 --> 00:24:02,760
Yeah. Right. For a $5 item. I'm like, what,

556
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:04,400
-- what is wrong with
-- you? I

557
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,290
refuse that because quite frankly, it's more hassle than it's worth,

558
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:08,160
you know, I should have

559
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:08,439
a

560
00:24:08,829 --> 00:24:09,099
$5

561
00:24:09,349 --> 00:24:09,810
who cares?

562
00:24:09,819 --> 00:24:10,000
Well,

563
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:12,119
-- and
-- part of me was thinking there's no way you're

564
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:14,020
going to request a signature on a $5 item.

565
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,750
I bet this is something else I ordered

566
00:24:16,069 --> 00:24:18,410
and, and they just never sent the bunny ears.

567
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:19,430
No bunny ears.

568
00:24:20,199 --> 00:24:22,989
That's one reason I like Amazon. They just throw my packages.

569
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,770
I know. Seriously.

570
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:28,089
I mean, yes, if I'm buying a eight super expensive TV or something,

571
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:29,329
great request a signature.

572
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:30,050
I'm fine with that.

573
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:30,829
I know they don't,

574
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:35,260
I've had stuff left behind my snow shovel with the door mat on the back porch.

575
00:24:35,819 --> 00:24:36,589
Honestly,

576
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,790
I, I was having this discussion, but basically

577
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:41,189
when you think about, like, yeah, package stuff happens,

578
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:43,270
like we discussed this last time and I think the,

579
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:46,150
the rate is low enough that quite honestly it doesn't really matter.

580
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,729
I guarantee it doesn't.

581
00:24:48,329 --> 00:24:49,000
-- Right.
-- You know.

582
00:24:50,729 --> 00:24:54,310
So, but anyways, it's curious to see that the revenue Canada, you know,

583
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,150
is

584
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:00,150
what I'm more shocked about is that revenue Canada did not do this sooner.

585
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:02,459
Yeah,

586
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,449
I can, I can agree with that. I wonder,

587
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,239
I'm,

588
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:12,020
I'm guessing it might be part of one of those Panama papers or what's the other,

589
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,800
those leaks that they're discovering

590
00:25:14,209 --> 00:25:16,069
that, you know, maybe some, because for example,

591
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:19,020
I used to have a contract but I got paid through paypal.

592
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:22,310
-- So it was quite a bit of money on a yearly basis, right? And I declared
-- it all

593
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,020
personal account.

594
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:25,300
Uh,

595
00:25:25,439 --> 00:25:27,079
it was personal or business.

596
00:25:27,089 --> 00:25:31,020
I forget I flipped to business at some point so long ago I don't even remember. Right.

597
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,339
But, you know, I

598
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:35,609
like most tax places you declare every penny because if

599
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:37,420
they find you not declaring every penny then they,

600
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:39,219
you know, come down on you like a sack.

601
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:40,170
Seriously, man.

602
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:44,660
Like, yeah, just don't, I, I never mess with taxes and II, I know people that,

603
00:25:44,969 --> 00:25:47,030
you know, they'll, they'll always be like, oh, what about this?

604
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,390
And you can do this and that and this,

605
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,550
and it's like I'm gonna make maybe $100 if I do those things and

606
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:57,130
if I get audited I'm going to be probably paying $4000 to attorneys.

607
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,880
It's just, it is not the return on investment. There is not worth it.

608
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:06,089
But, uh, no, I'm really curious because I was thinking about what, there's a lot of,

609
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:08,270
sort of paypal like entities now online,

610
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,489
like there's a lot of these sort of online banks.

611
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:10,949
Um,

612
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:14,300
you know, ing, being a great example. Right. It's, it's an online bank.

613
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:18,790
-- They, as far as I know, have zero branches,
-- they were bought by capital one

614
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,979
because I used to use ING

615
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,069
and now

616
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,319
now I'm a capital one customer and I'm too lazy to move.

617
00:26:25,689 --> 00:26:27,890
There are online only banks, there are

618
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,319
with respect to the Equifax salary thing. I mean

619
00:26:30,425 --> 00:26:31,844
the frustrating part here is, is that

620
00:26:31,994 --> 00:26:34,055
again, apparently you can opt out of this um

621
00:26:34,444 --> 00:26:37,484
but you have to phone or mail them or email them and of course, you know,

622
00:26:37,494 --> 00:26:39,165
the process is not going to be simple.

623
00:26:39,594 --> 00:26:40,755
And here's the problem.

624
00:26:41,015 --> 00:26:45,785
A lot of places use a salary check for actually legitimate good reasons.

625
00:26:45,795 --> 00:26:49,444
Like for example, uh if you want to rent a property,

626
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,069
you know,

627
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:51,599
it kind of makes sense that they might want to check

628
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:54,209
your salary that you actually can afford to pay for this because

629
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:56,849
um something that's recently come up in the news this

630
00:26:56,859 --> 00:26:59,479
week in Canada is like all these sort of landlord

631
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,750
tenant horror stories where the tenants, you know,

632
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,699
totally mess with the landlords and they know the law enough that they

633
00:27:04,709 --> 00:27:07,780
can prolong the process for six months and then finally get booted out,

634
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:08,619
you know,

635
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,189
and there was this article on the CBC about

636
00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:14,310
this guy who like rented out three apartments,

637
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:15,829
used a, like, he basically

638
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:18,510
provided a credit report but he like had cut and paste, you know,

639
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,469
change the info to show a good credit score,

640
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,280
you know.

641
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:24,520
So now they're saying like, landlords shouldn't take credit reports from people,

642
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:25,750
they should like run it themselves.

643
00:27:25,949 --> 00:27:30,310
I mean, I think that's a given and, and even in the context of

644
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:34,349
your, your pay, I know anytime I've rented things in the past

645
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:37,750
they demanded for, for long periods of time,

646
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,959
they demanded like two or three paychecks, you know,

647
00:27:39,969 --> 00:27:41,689
the last two or three paychecks or whatever

648
00:27:41,699 --> 00:27:44,369
steps to prove that I actually have income.

649
00:27:45,329 --> 00:27:47,109
The problem is those can easily be forged.

650
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:50,869
Yeah, they can be forged, but that's fraud, right? I mean,

651
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:52,040
so

652
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:55,729
I'm going to tie this back to security because I'm

653
00:27:55,739 --> 00:27:59,069
actually dealing with some similar problems as this is,

654
00:28:00,099 --> 00:28:02,760
those are two different problems, fraud

655
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:07,160
and it is a a that is a crime on its own, right?

656
00:28:07,449 --> 00:28:08,359
And so

657
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,020
you do need a certain amount of due diligence,

658
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:16,040
but you can't expect every single person in every process to,

659
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:18,780
to handle every possible scenario.

660
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,680
I mean, let's face it.

661
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,459
-- There's always what they're
-- suggesting here, for example,

662
00:28:22,469 --> 00:28:26,560
is rather than the person providing the Equifax printout is that, you know,

663
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:29,680
you go to Equifax and run there and like you basically get their name,

664
00:28:29,689 --> 00:28:31,380
social insurance number and you go to Equifax,

665
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:34,209
pay the 20 bucks and get the information directly from Equifax.

666
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:37,349
-- Ok. You know, so that, you know, it's quote unquote,
-- correct.

667
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,599
If, if that's your prerogative,

668
00:28:39,949 --> 00:28:42,050
I don't see a problem with that. Right.

669
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,849
But, but even if you do that, you aren't going to stop fraud.

670
00:28:45,189 --> 00:28:46,609
-- Right?
-- Well, no, no, no.

671
00:28:46,849 --> 00:28:50,719
What, what I'm trying to point out basically is that we're moving from.

672
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,180
So traditionally, whenever I've rented,

673
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:53,579
they've always been happy with a printout of

674
00:28:53,589 --> 00:28:55,099
the credit report whenever they ask for that.

675
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:59,609
But we're moving now to a system where they'll want enough personal

676
00:28:59,619 --> 00:29:01,849
information about you to call up Equifax and get your data.

677
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,780
But do you trust some random landlord to protect your personal information?

678
00:29:07,729 --> 00:29:08,949
Because by definition,

679
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:10,030
they're going to have to ask enough

680
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,430
about you to essentially perform identity theft,

681
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,119
right? So we're basically trading one problem for a new set of problems.

682
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,359
And that's my biggest concern around this thing is that,

683
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:22,750
you know, the landlords by and large, uh depending on the market, you know,

684
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,069
some markets, the landlords have less power because there's, you know,

685
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:28,099
low uh high vacancy rates, right?

686
00:29:28,109 --> 00:29:29,479
And then other markets like,

687
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:30,510
um

688
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,089
you know, there's like a very, very low vacancy rate.

689
00:29:33,099 --> 00:29:33,849
So, you know,

690
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:35,250
I'm gonna make you jump through hoops that

691
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,579
might expose your personal information to the world.

692
00:29:37,869 --> 00:29:38,209
Well,

693
00:29:38,219 --> 00:29:40,770
somebody's gonna have to be willing to do that because they need to live somewhere,

694
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:42,030
you know,

695
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,849
and that's my concern is we end up with this sort of,

696
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:49,849
you know, diffuse personal information floating around everywhere and it kind of,

697
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:50,890
you know, goes back to this.

698
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,410
Well,

699
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:53,650
I think we're sort of already there

700
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:55,060
a

701
00:29:55,219 --> 00:29:56,319
long time ago, man.

702
00:29:58,219 --> 00:29:58,750
Um,

703
00:29:59,469 --> 00:29:59,930
again,

704
00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:04,400
I've definitely rented from companies now that in hindsight,

705
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,939
I really wouldn't trust with, you know,

706
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,920
much of my personal information.

707
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,619
Um I remember there's this one local computer store that wanted a

708
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:14,079
copy of my driver's license for me to buy stuff there.

709
00:30:14,089 --> 00:30:17,800
And I'm talking about stuff like a mouse and using a debit card. And I was like, no

710
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,880
absolute like II, I

711
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:22,119
walked out of the store and drove, you know,

712
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:24,250
another 10 minutes to the apple store where they'll

713
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,900
just take my money and let me leave.

714
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,790
Um But, you know, this is my concern is that on the one hand,

715
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,459
I get that landlords want to and need to protect themselves from,

716
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,359
you know, these sort of nightmare tenants.

717
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,119
But now, you know, we have every single tenant on the planet, you know,

718
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,900
having to give up their personal information to rent

719
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:44,520
a place and exposing themselves to identity fraud.

720
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:45,719
Because um the,

721
00:30:45,829 --> 00:30:49,439
the real problem is uh talking about this Equifax salary thing

722
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:52,569
is they use what's called knowledge based authentication where

723
00:30:52,579 --> 00:30:55,319
they ask you information about yourself to authenticate you.

724
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:58,250
Right. Because you don't have an account with Equifax,

725
00:30:58,699 --> 00:31:00,439
right? They just have a copy of all your data.

726
00:31:00,579 --> 00:31:02,079
Well, how do you prove that? You're Josh,

727
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:06,489
you have an account with Equifax. Funny you say that

728
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,020
when you, when you freeze your credit,

729
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,369
you are given essentially a login,

730
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:15,089
but that's for the credit stuff though. Not for the salary.

731
00:31:15,469 --> 00:31:17,319
Yeah. I don't know. Maybe it doesn't matter.

732
00:31:17,719 --> 00:31:18,380
Right.

733
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:20,239
I know what you mean though because I've,

734
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,729
I've answered questions like this in the past where they ask, you know,

735
00:31:22,739 --> 00:31:25,239
what are your last three addresses or?

736
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,959
You know what, who, whose name is on your pay stub or?

737
00:31:29,219 --> 00:31:31,119
Yeah, crazy stuff like that. And

738
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:32,310
yeah.

739
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:33,750
Yeah, you got to love it.

740
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,430
And thanks to big data, none of it's a secret.

741
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,369
Well, and also thanks to the way these companies operate,

742
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,569
I can now use that information to assume your identity.

743
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:43,819
Uh

744
00:31:44,489 --> 00:31:47,020
Maybe

745
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,819
you can't unlock my credit yet

746
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:51,589
but

747
00:31:52,229 --> 00:31:52,410
you talking

748
00:31:52,589 --> 00:31:53,040
about. So the

749
00:31:53,229 --> 00:31:56,459
problem is if you, for example, do freeze your salary reports,

750
00:31:56,829 --> 00:31:59,339
you may not be able to rent an apartment or something that, you know,

751
00:31:59,349 --> 00:32:01,660
for somebody that wants to do a salary check on you.

752
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,709
You know, how do you deal with that now? Right. And so it's,

753
00:32:03,969 --> 00:32:04,349
they're,

754
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:07,270
they're sort of letting people take a secure option but that secure

755
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,689
option in the modern world is such a giant pain in the.

756
00:32:09,699 --> 00:32:13,869
-- But
-- yeah, but no man, I mean, that, that's not a valid argument.

757
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,030
I mean, this would be like going to the bank and getting a loan and saying

758
00:32:17,219 --> 00:32:20,319
I can't check my credit, they're going to say great, then we're not giving you a loan.

759
00:32:20,329 --> 00:32:20,640
Right?

760
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,250
That's what I mean. Right. Is

761
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,260
you want to take these security measures and you

762
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:26,319
won't be able to participate in the modern world.

763
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:30,280
Uh Yes. And that is becoming the new challenge, isn't it? Is?

764
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:32,359
How do we, how do we balance

765
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,520
all of these things together?

766
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:38,459
And, and I don't, I don't know what the answer is. I mean, I,

767
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,920
there's always like that,

768
00:32:40,069 --> 00:32:42,989
that open source, freedom, loving side of me that says, you know,

769
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,699
everything should be free and we shouldn't give

770
00:32:44,709 --> 00:32:46,510
any information to anybody and we should,

771
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,760
you know, do it all ourselves.

772
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:50,880
Then there's a part of me that's like I'm too lazy and old to care.

773
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:53,839
Just take some money and, and make this go away.

774
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,479
Right.

775
00:32:55,489 --> 00:32:57,579
Well, I'm not going to give up my cell phone,

776
00:32:58,739 --> 00:32:59,079
right?

777
00:32:59,089 --> 00:33:05,420
Like I, I can't, I my calendar, my email, my to do list my, you know, my army focus

778
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,959
like my life literally would fall apart without army focus.

779
00:33:08,969 --> 00:33:14,239
-- I would be outside in the cold, naked,
-- dying. I, I think this is a challenge

780
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:18,420
that we should figure out how to test.

781
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,219
But no, II, I totally understand what you're saying.

782
00:33:21,229 --> 00:33:24,189
And you know, that's something I think about too every now and again is,

783
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,140
how long have we had smartphones?

784
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:26,800
10 years

785
00:33:27,719 --> 00:33:31,140
and, and my life is unlivable at this point without one. I mean,

786
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,579
-- I mean,
-- think about it, but the same is true of running water.

787
00:33:33,989 --> 00:33:36,160
Yeah. But we've, we've had that longer than 10 years.

788
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:39,890
-- Right.
-- There was a, many years ago in Canada there were some, uh,

789
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,770
issues with, uh, water supplies in towns

790
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,400
and I,

791
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:47,839
I think it was in ML A ended up writing a brilliant letter on how to kill a community.

792
00:33:47,849 --> 00:33:52,630
And one of the top ways to kill a community, no fresh water, like no drinkable water,

793
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,430
water supply

794
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,750
because it makes life impossible. I mean,

795
00:33:55,859 --> 00:33:56,520
it does,

796
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:00,189
you know, I remember once, um when I was living with my parents, the,

797
00:34:00,199 --> 00:34:01,859
the water made out in the street broke

798
00:34:02,339 --> 00:34:05,349
because, you know, it was like 60 years old cast iron, whatever.

799
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,629
So, you know, we were without water for like, it was like

800
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,989
12 or 18 hours, it was under a day

801
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,688
and like the water truck was actually literally

802
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:14,750
parked in front of my parents' house.

803
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,760
So we, you know, we could go outside, get a bucket of water, go back in

804
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:19,389
and it was just complete

805
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:23,540
pain. Like, I don't know how people lived without running water,

806
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:24,989
-- but
-- they all had cholera

807
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,610
like because they,

808
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:27,708
they, they,

809
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,739
they did their business in a bucket and then

810
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,438
they threw it into the street and this is why

811
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,870
if you are rich you lived on the top floor

812
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,870
because then nobody was throwing their bucket past your window.

813
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,820
You know, like I would like to flush the toilet.

814
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,340
No, you can't do that without going outside for a bucket of water.

815
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:44,399
I'd like to,

816
00:34:44,735 --> 00:34:44,774
you

817
00:34:44,965 --> 00:34:45,125
mean

818
00:34:45,514 --> 00:34:45,925
in, in that

819
00:34:47,364 --> 00:34:50,445
-- there were no buckets of water back in the day? Yeah,
-- exactly.

820
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:53,955
So, I mean, you know, and so things like, can I live without running water?

821
00:34:53,965 --> 00:34:56,774
-- Well, technically, yes, because
-- you know, you cannot,

822
00:34:57,024 --> 00:34:57,625
you cannot

823
00:34:57,784 --> 00:34:58,125
do

824
00:34:58,935 --> 00:34:59,995
without running water

825
00:35:02,274 --> 00:35:02,324
people.

826
00:35:02,635 --> 00:35:02,665
Yes.

827
00:35:03,274 --> 00:35:03,294
Yeah.

828
00:35:04,334 --> 00:35:04,594
Well,

829
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:06,135
I think part of it is you definitely can't

830
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:08,665
have density of people without infrastructure like roads,

831
00:35:08,675 --> 00:35:09,814
electricity power,

832
00:35:10,245 --> 00:35:13,435
you just can't have density of people without it being miserable.

833
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,000
You know,

834
00:35:15,189 --> 00:35:18,620
and that's kind of, for example, like the modern world with smartphones,

835
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:22,280
I can't have as much going on in my life without having, you know,

836
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,969
a system that lives in my pocket that helps me.

837
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:26,770
-- So
-- you're actually saying that these smartphones are

838
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,409
making us busier in reducing our quality of life

839
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,090
well,

840
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,270
or you could flip it on its head and

841
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,129
they're making us more efficient because for example,

842
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:37,739
when I'm standing in the checkout line at the superstore now, I can like be

843
00:35:37,899 --> 00:35:41,010
browsing the internet checking, email, buying stuff on Amazon.

844
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:44,520
Uh you know, I do a lot of price checking now when I'm buying stuff,

845
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,159
you know, because for example, I,

846
00:35:46,449 --> 00:35:48,669
I was at a store the other day and the board game,

847
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:53,189
one board game at the store was actually $3 cheaper than on Amazon quite shockingly.

848
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:56,639
And then another board game was uh $30 less on Amazon.

849
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,790
So for example, just, you know,

850
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,429
I can't do smart checking with a dumb phone or a

851
00:36:02,439 --> 00:36:05,570
-- price checking with a dumb phone
-- and I don't price check.

852
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,830
Right. Anyway,

853
00:36:07,659 --> 00:36:10,159
it's, I don't know, man, it's crazy stuff.

854
00:36:10,219 --> 00:36:12,370
Well, and I think this really goes back to what Bruce Schneier

855
00:36:12,489 --> 00:36:17,719
has been talking a lot is about like what we thought of as privacy is dead

856
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,500
and it's never coming back,

857
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:21,209
right? Like

858
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:23,560
nobody is going to rent like

859
00:36:23,989 --> 00:36:26,399
to anybody without doing a proper credit check

860
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,659
soon because you know, you can either

861
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:34,189
not do it and you have this huge risk of like fraud and this person screwing

862
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:37,520
you over and like tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees and fixing the house

863
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:40,370
or you can spend 20 bucks and require enough personal information to

864
00:36:40,379 --> 00:36:42,800
do a credit check or a salary check on the person.

865
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:43,860
Right.

866
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:48,669
Any, well, you know, the major landlords, like the companies are,

867
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:51,439
are obviously going to start doing this if they are not already

868
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:53,840
and it's going to trickle down to the small landlords, you know,

869
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:56,870
because once they get bitten or know somebody that got bitten, they're not,

870
00:36:56,879 --> 00:36:57,949
they're not going to take that risk.

871
00:36:57,959 --> 00:36:59,000
I mean, it would be insane to.

872
00:36:59,169 --> 00:37:02,300
Yep. Oh, I get it. I, I totally get it.

873
00:37:02,479 --> 00:37:02,860
Right. A

874
00:37:02,969 --> 00:37:05,360
great example is I know the local ski hill now,

875
00:37:05,919 --> 00:37:08,939
starting this year requires all the ski instructors

876
00:37:08,949 --> 00:37:10,899
to go get a criminal background check.

877
00:37:10,909 --> 00:37:14,780
And I believe also a child welfare check, you know, which costs about 70 bucks to get.

878
00:37:15,229 --> 00:37:16,729
It takes a couple of hours because you got to go

879
00:37:16,739 --> 00:37:18,739
down to this office on the west side and like,

880
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,510
fill out a bunch of paperwork and, like,

881
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,500
submit it and then wait like a couple of weeks.

882
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:26,209
Um, and they're basically passing that cost on to the ski instructors.

883
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:26,879
You know,

884
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:30,370
you have to, the $70 cost if you want to be a ski instructor at the ski.

885
00:37:30,699 --> 00:37:32,649
I don't see that kind of stuff annoys me.

886
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:35,570
Don't do that at least pay for the thing if you're going to make them get it.

887
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,600
That seems unfair.

888
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,399
I would agree. But

889
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,409
there's a lot more people that want to be ski instructors than,

890
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,090
you know,

891
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:45,250
they need so they can do this. Right. There's a lot of people.

892
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,649
Yeah. Well, it's supply and demand. Right.

893
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,500
Yeah, I suppose, I suppose

894
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:52,620
so.

895
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,409
You know, it's just, it's, I see a lot like, well,

896
00:37:55,419 --> 00:37:58,360
think about all the companies that are passing like the whole identity theft thing.

897
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:58,899
Right? Like

898
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:02,500
that cost the hassle of that is born

899
00:38:02,629 --> 00:38:04,199
primarily by the consumer now. Right.

900
00:38:04,209 --> 00:38:05,820
You read all these stories, these people spent

901
00:38:06,149 --> 00:38:08,120
hundreds of hours trying to un

902
00:38:08,229 --> 00:38:09,620
you know, mess their lives.

903
00:38:10,879 --> 00:38:16,050
But even then it's not enough people to create any real change. Yet,

904
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:19,199
we're going to need a whole lot more people to have

905
00:38:19,209 --> 00:38:22,459
their identity stolen before anyone cares enough to fix it.

906
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,020
Yeah.

907
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,340
Well, the problem is, is that, um,

908
00:38:28,149 --> 00:38:30,620
even if a whole pile of people get their identity stolen, well,

909
00:38:30,629 --> 00:38:31,530
what's going to happen?

910
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,340
I mean, unless we get legislation that forces companies,

911
00:38:34,989 --> 00:38:35,340
that's what

912
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:42,080
is, is I compare it to things like auto safety and pollution and things like that is

913
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,409
basically things had to get so bad

914
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:47,570
that the people demanded the government fix it.

915
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:53,479
And we're, I mean, this is where security. I, I feel like a crazy person a lot is

916
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,500
we talk about this stuff and we say things like, oh,

917
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,959
we should fix that or we should do this or we should do that.

918
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:02,699
And the reality is most of the things we think are important

919
00:39:02,709 --> 00:39:06,689
topics aren't even on a person's top 100 list of problems.

920
00:39:06,879 --> 00:39:07,280
Right?

921
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,330
And, and

922
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,679
there's no hope any of this is going to get fixed.

923
00:39:10,689 --> 00:39:13,000
I mean, Iot security is a great example, right? Where

924
00:39:13,419 --> 00:39:17,120
these IOT devices are just terrible and they're super insecure

925
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,169
and, and you've got people like us complaining about it

926
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:20,510
a

927
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:20,780
bit.

928
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:26,659
I don't know if you saw but arm the CPU arm people are doing

929
00:39:26,669 --> 00:39:29,689
a security framework for updates and software

930
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:32,000
and everything for IOT and they're releasing it

931
00:39:32,225 --> 00:39:35,135
-- publicly is my understanding,
-- I heard about that and

932
00:39:35,264 --> 00:39:39,044
I, I guess we'll wait and see if it works. I hope it does.

933
00:39:39,094 --> 00:39:42,774
Well, the good news is that gets like the low level sort of operating system,

934
00:39:42,784 --> 00:39:43,574
stuff taken care of.

935
00:39:43,584 --> 00:39:44,725
But the problem is you're still going to have, like,

936
00:39:44,735 --> 00:39:47,735
people writing absent PHP on top of it that are garbage like

937
00:39:48,685 --> 00:39:50,925
that you can't change or whatever.

938
00:39:51,735 --> 00:39:51,745
I

939
00:39:51,965 --> 00:39:53,195
-- know.
-- But, you know, it's a start,

940
00:39:53,205 --> 00:39:55,485
right. It is, it's the beginning. But

941
00:39:55,614 --> 00:39:57,004
here's the thing

942
00:39:57,344 --> 00:39:58,534
they are,

943
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:03,409
they're, they're giving people some of the tools they need to do something, right?

944
00:40:03,419 --> 00:40:06,459
But that doesn't mean people are going to do it right or care

945
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:09,020
and the only reason they're going to care or do it right is

946
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:12,770
if using this thing from arm costs less money than doing it themselves.

947
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:13,530
Right.

948
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,149
Well, that's my hope is, you know, like the frameworks, right?

949
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:19,860
That people will hopefully start using these frameworks more and more because,

950
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:23,290
you know, like going back to your slides with the OAP top 10 and how,

951
00:40:24,209 --> 00:40:26,040
yeah, basically it's actually three issues,

952
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:29,010
all of which are basically solved by use a framework.

953
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,219
-- That's good.
-- Uh

954
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,489
That's, that, that solves most of them.

955
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,989
Actually the, the new OAP list uh just came out

956
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,260
and I think it is a draft now,

957
00:40:38,699 --> 00:40:41,199
I don't think it's been officially announced,

958
00:40:41,479 --> 00:40:43,250
but we should talk about it at some point

959
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,840
because I actually looked back at all the historic O

960
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:46,889
AP lists

961
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,010
and they are

962
00:40:48,189 --> 00:40:49,639
painfully similar.

963
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:51,189
Yes.

964
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,469
Well, we still have the same problem. So they're not wrong.

965
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,770
-- I
-- don't even think it's at the end of

966
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:56,159
the

967
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:56,280
o

968
00:40:56,409 --> 00:40:56,439
was

969
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:00,879
goal I think is to make a list not to fix problems.

970
00:41:01,449 --> 00:41:01,860
So

971
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:02,709
good

972
00:41:02,939 --> 00:41:02,989
job

973
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:03,530
guys

974
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:04,949
there actually

975
00:41:05,169 --> 00:41:05,850
any,

976
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,310
like, there's sort of,

977
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,399
they have that generic advice of what the problem is and how to solve it, which is not

978
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,500
completely useless, but more to the point,

979
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:14,699
like, has somebody like Ola

980
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:19,409
done an actual review of, say the top 20 or 50 web frameworks

981
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,790
-- and what we should be using.
-- They've done certain things.

982
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,739
They're pretty good about a lot of that stuff actually.

983
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:26,399
But part of my complaint is 10 is too many

984
00:41:27,419 --> 00:41:28,100
and

985
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:30,080
they're, they're probably not getting,

986
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:32,590
they're, they're not reaching the people they need to reach.

987
00:41:32,929 --> 00:41:34,959
And that, that's part of the challenge is how do you,

988
00:41:34,969 --> 00:41:37,439
how do you get some of this messaging to the right people?

989
00:41:37,449 --> 00:41:38,600
And I, I don't know

990
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:40,600
if I did, I, obviously

991
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:41,929
we have fixed a lot.

992
00:41:41,949 --> 00:41:45,280
I mean, a lot of people would go back to that whole education piece, which

993
00:41:46,179 --> 00:41:49,810
in principle. Yes, but in practice, obviously, no,

994
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,600
you can't educate our way out of this one.

995
00:41:53,209 --> 00:41:55,780
Well, it's, I don't know, I mean, we don't have the,

996
00:41:56,429 --> 00:41:59,189
some industries have like engineering is a great example.

997
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:02,629
Engineering has largely educated themselves out of like bridges.

998
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:08,020
The government throws people in jail if the bridge collapses. No one educates

999
00:42:08,229 --> 00:42:08,750
themselves.

1000
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,429
They don't want to go to jail.

1001
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,510
And as a result of that,

1002
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,409
you know, you have very good education for engineers.

1003
00:42:17,419 --> 00:42:20,429
And then, for example, to be a professional engineer in Canada,

1004
00:42:20,629 --> 00:42:24,969
you have to effectively apprentice, you have to work under another PN for a while.

1005
00:42:24,979 --> 00:42:27,800
I think it's four years now or something before you can become one

1006
00:42:28,219 --> 00:42:29,800
that's part of that education piece.

1007
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:31,520
And yeah, there's totally the stick of, like,

1008
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:33,949
you sign off on something and it falls down and kill somebody.

1009
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,290
-- Things happen
-- to go to

1010
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:35,500
jail.

1011
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:35,649
Uh,

1012
00:42:35,939 --> 00:42:38,479
actually I remember when I graduated from college,

1013
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:40,520
many of the people I went to school with were getting,

1014
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:43,379
they were taking the pe test and I knew I was going to go into it.

1015
00:42:43,389 --> 00:42:44,479
So I'm like, I don't need that

1016
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:44,979
and

1017
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:50,979
it was so much work and they studied so hard and I was like, at the bar drinking beer.

1018
00:42:50,989 --> 00:42:52,000
It was, it was great.

1019
00:42:52,709 --> 00:42:53,139
Uh,

1020
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,780
but so the thing is I, the,

1021
00:42:55,979 --> 00:43:01,260
the, well, I guess what I'm trying to say is education is not necessarily

1022
00:43:01,439 --> 00:43:04,770
the answer in the sense of there needs to be something driving

1023
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:07,899
that education both providing it and people wanting to take it.

1024
00:43:07,909 --> 00:43:09,699
Let's, let's look at pollution.

1025
00:43:09,919 --> 00:43:13,370
Do you think if we just educated everyone about pollution that would have solved it?

1026
00:43:13,889 --> 00:43:14,409
No.

1027
00:43:14,909 --> 00:43:16,580
No, it wouldn't have solved anything.

1028
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:21,600
-- Uh, people still smoke cigarettes. Yes.
-- And that one is,

1029
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:25,590
I don't know if education solved that or did that, the high prices?

1030
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:29,360
Maybe because I know that these things are taxed to death in a lot of places.

1031
00:43:29,669 --> 00:43:34,600
Uh, well then partly it's, you, you can't smoke as easily.

1032
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:36,040
Like, for example, smoking

1033
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:38,639
you can't smoke in public places in

1034
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,429
most of Canada, I think, you know,

1035
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,239
uh, well, when I say public places, I mean, indoors outdoors, obviously, you know,

1036
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:48,129
uh, there's signs always saying you have to be 20 ft from the door or whatever.

1037
00:43:48,169 --> 00:43:49,139
-- So there's like this
-- little, like,

1038
00:43:49,929 --> 00:43:50,820
huddle of smokers.

1039
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:52,209
Yeah.

1040
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,310
You know, and there's been,

1041
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,100
I know some places have banned smoking in cars with Children,

1042
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:57,729
um, things like that.

1043
00:43:57,739 --> 00:44:01,739
So, you know, I, I still see people smoking in their cars, which I find just bizarre.

1044
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:03,250
But, um,

1045
00:44:03,989 --> 00:44:08,770
no, I, I think education only works if essentially people,

1046
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,610
well, first of all this presupposes that there is good education.

1047
00:44:13,669 --> 00:44:14,050
Right.

1048
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:16,280
Because, you know, if you have bad education that's not gonna happen,

1049
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:18,280
-- it is
-- worse than nothing insecure.

1050
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:22,689
And number two people actually have to want to take this education and use it.

1051
00:44:23,729 --> 00:44:28,270
Ok. I'm going to, I'm going to say no one wants to take it. You have to make them

1052
00:44:29,179 --> 00:44:29,929
pretty much. Yeah,

1053
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:30,889
I

1054
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,719
think either require certification or,

1055
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:34,040
yeah,

1056
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:35,709
you have to make the penalties high enough that they

1057
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:36,939
want to make sure they're doing the right thing.

1058
00:44:36,949 --> 00:44:38,800
Right. But then, but then

1059
00:44:38,929 --> 00:44:40,399
to make it mandatory

1060
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,939
you need an incentive for some organization.

1061
00:44:43,949 --> 00:44:47,360
Be it like an insurance company or the government or something

1062
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:48,719
to care.

1063
00:44:48,889 --> 00:44:49,959
And today

1064
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:53,459
you can make the most terrible insecure software on the planet

1065
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:56,360
and it doesn't really make a difference, does it?

1066
00:44:57,639 --> 00:45:01,989
Well, I think we've pretty firmly established with the user, end user license.

1067
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:02,639
What's you

1068
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:04,739
stand for? Again, end user license agreement.

1069
00:45:04,919 --> 00:45:05,469
That's what the,

1070
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:08,820
I was thinking association for some reason anyways. Um,

1071
00:45:09,219 --> 00:45:11,699
we, we've largely established that, yeah,

1072
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:14,590
even if your software does something terrible

1073
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,530
suing and recovering that is nontrivial in almost all jurisdictions.

1074
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:27,310
So, yeah, just, uh, well, there's that happy bit of news. I

1075
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:27,649
know.

1076
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:27,850
I

1077
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:28,209
know.

1078
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:29,570
And on the flip side,

1079
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:32,409
it's good though because it's allowed innovation in the it industry there,

1080
00:45:32,419 --> 00:45:32,770
you know,

1081
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:37,310
quite often people do build garbage things that sort of slowly get better.

1082
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,489
I mean, look at a PHP is a great example. PHP.

1083
00:45:39,669 --> 00:45:41,040
I think people would widely agree

1084
00:45:41,209 --> 00:45:46,010
from a design and engineering point of view is, is a train wreck, huge train wreck,

1085
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:51,149
-- but it's enabled so many awesome things like wordpress and Facebook
-- like, ok,

1086
00:45:51,159 --> 00:45:52,429
so let, let me ask this though,

1087
00:45:52,439 --> 00:45:57,010
is PP the problem or is it the people using PP that are the problem?

1088
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:02,040
Well, judging by the number of security flaws actually in the language PHP,

1089
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,179
let alone the PHP applications.

1090
00:46:04,189 --> 00:46:08,199
I mean PHP is, it wasn't designed, it was, it was evolved. I mean, it's got

1091
00:46:08,389 --> 00:46:08,659
you see

1092
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:08,860
those

1093
00:46:09,409 --> 00:46:10,939
slide decks where it's like,

1094
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,419
you know, zero equals equals zero false or whatever.

1095
00:46:14,429 --> 00:46:17,280
Like you get these crazy results because of the way PHP does typing and

1096
00:46:17,429 --> 00:46:19,340
stuff, right? Like it's, it's obviously a bit of a train wreck

1097
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:20,449
but who cares?

1098
00:46:20,459 --> 00:46:23,340
People have built things of amazing value on top of them,

1099
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:25,020
like wordpress or Facebook or

1100
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:27,659
like the number of PHP apps out there

1101
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:28,370
is

1102
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:29,280
stupid

1103
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:30,179
and

1104
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:34,409
you know, are they all insecure? Yeah, generally, yeah, they are all insecure.

1105
00:46:34,419 --> 00:46:37,100
But do they also provide a ton of value

1106
00:46:37,429 --> 00:46:40,379
and let people get things done and sell stuff online? Yeah, totally.

1107
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:43,199
And that generally outweighs,

1108
00:46:43,699 --> 00:46:44,570
you know, it's like the crew.

1109
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:45,149
It's like, oh,

1110
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:47,330
everybody's discovering container ships or running it

1111
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:48,699
systems that were designed to be stand

1112
00:46:48,709 --> 00:46:51,709
alone except now they have like satellite internet hooked up on all of these.

1113
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:53,189
Right.

1114
00:46:53,479 --> 00:46:56,350
And the good news is generally speaking, well,

1115
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,949
outside of one or two spots in the world,

1116
00:46:57,959 --> 00:47:01,629
people generally aren't hijacking container ships or robbing them

1117
00:47:02,149 --> 00:47:02,510
now that

1118
00:47:02,649 --> 00:47:04,560
they've learned from us, they can,

1119
00:47:05,149 --> 00:47:05,860
well, I think

1120
00:47:06,169 --> 00:47:08,600
there would be some real physical challenges and like

1121
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:12,060
getting the container off the ship or getting into

1122
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:13,830
the container depending where it is in the stacks,

1123
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,310
things like that.

1124
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:14,600
But

1125
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:15,919
regardless the point is,

1126
00:47:16,169 --> 00:47:18,469
you know, the container industry has enabled

1127
00:47:18,939 --> 00:47:20,949
the global economy that we have today,

1128
00:47:21,989 --> 00:47:24,919
like straight up, you know, the, the economy that we have

1129
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:27,449
flat out would not exist without containers.

1130
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:32,610
This is true. It's true. It's similar to the internet or smartphones. Right.

1131
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:35,370
Like, it is part of life and we can't get rid of it.

1132
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:38,610
-- Yeah.
-- I mean, it's just, it's enabled so much. I mean,

1133
00:47:38,979 --> 00:47:41,830
you know, when these, when these, uh, legislature, uh,

1134
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,860
when these legislators talk about

1135
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:46,679
limiting the internet, I mean, for example, you know,

1136
00:47:46,689 --> 00:47:49,429
there's court cases where somebody is banned from using the

1137
00:47:49,439 --> 00:47:51,810
internet or banned from using phones And it's like,

1138
00:47:52,629 --> 00:47:56,600
uh, I, I believe there's a challenge in Canada whether or not that's constitutional

1139
00:47:57,659 --> 00:47:58,320
because like,

1140
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:01,479
how would you live in the modern world without access to the phone and internet?

1141
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:04,050
Right.

1142
00:48:04,389 --> 00:48:05,600
I, I don't know.

1143
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:09,810
It's, I agree with you though. It's certainly something you can't live without

1144
00:48:11,219 --> 00:48:14,010
-- anymore. You can't,
-- unless you're like a crazy dude living in the woods,

1145
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:18,229
-- random animals. It's the dream
-- right there. It's living the dream.

1146
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:20,610
Kurt live in the dream. All right. We should,

1147
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:23,560
we should call it any, any parting thoughts

1148
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,810
we need to start thinking about

1149
00:48:26,209 --> 00:48:28,889
what actually does matter with privacy because I've,

1150
00:48:28,899 --> 00:48:32,209
-- that's something I've not really heard people talk about
-- because we don't know,

1151
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:34,760
we have no idea

1152
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,840
what the answer to that is.

1153
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:39,100
We know privacy sounds like a neat idea,

1154
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:41,560
but we don't know what it means and we don't know how to get there.

1155
00:48:41,629 --> 00:48:42,550
So, there you go.

1156
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:44,419
All right.

1157
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,659
All right, man. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you, everyone for listening.
