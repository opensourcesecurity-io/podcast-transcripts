Hello and welcome to episode 28 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:11,039
Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime.

2
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:11,850
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,430
Kurt. How are you?

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:18,479
-- I'm excellent. It's like six above here. Celsius. Like
-- a crazy heat wave.

5
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,680
Yeah. Basically I went skiing without any mittens or gloves yesterday.

6
00:00:22,069 --> 00:00:23,680
I've done that before,

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,790
but it's

8
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,639
pretty rare to say the least.

9
00:00:27,049 --> 00:00:28,399
Yeah. So, no, it's nice.

10
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:29,540
So

11
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,670
today Rs A is coming up.

12
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,080
Oh, yes, it is. I can hardly wait.

13
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:38,430
Hopefully my head cold to be gone by then and we can freeze to death in San Francisco.

14
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,060
-- It'll be cold, man. Bring a coat. True.
-- Yeah. Well, it's, you know what it is?

15
00:00:43,069 --> 00:00:45,029
Honestly, it's a damp cold. Right.

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,259
And I'm, I, I can handle, uh, dry cold, like, minus 30 dry. Sure, whatever.

17
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,840
But like, even like five

18
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,509
Â°C and damp and I'm like miserable.

19
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:54,669
You're insane.

20
00:00:54,779 --> 00:01:00,099
I will take my, the damp five degrees over your minus 30

21
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,430
any day.

22
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:01,959
Uh,

23
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,279
it's, it's, you breathe it in and it just feels cold.

24
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,699
Uh Yeah. Yeah, it kind of does, but it's ok.

25
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:10,900
The, the Mosconi Center will be filled with people and it will be

26
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,959
-- so hot. We can't stand it.
-- It does get pretty funky

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,269
-- in
-- there.

28
00:01:14,279 --> 00:01:15,779
It is, man. It's crazy.

29
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,169
And you end up with the,

30
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,940
the, the floor with all the,

31
00:01:19,949 --> 00:01:22,510
the booths and all the craziness there and there's always

32
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:25,830
just strange smells and horrible noises and I mean,

33
00:01:25,839 --> 00:01:26,809
it is what it is.

34
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:27,410
Right. It's,

35
00:01:27,669 --> 00:01:29,930
it always reminds me of, I don't know

36
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:34,019
if you've ever lived in an apartment complex but in my younger days I did and

37
00:01:34,279 --> 00:01:34,699
there's,

38
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:38,730
there's always somebody cooking something that it's like, how can they eat that?

39
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,500
It smells terrible.

40
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,980
And that's, that's the conference center, right?

41
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,889
-- I've decided I'm not shaking hands anymore at conferences. Oh, who
-- cares, man.

42
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,459
Whatever. Don't be a sissy.

43
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,470
I just, I keep picking up horrible,

44
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,169
horrible bugs and I get sick like a day or two after I get home.

45
00:01:55,309 --> 00:01:58,050
If you don't shake hands, I will ensure you,

46
00:01:58,059 --> 00:02:01,760
you gain some terrible incurable disease from the floor of the muscular.

47
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:02,930
Its

48
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,620
more likely than not,

49
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,650
you know, the way I kind of look at it is,

50
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,610
yeah, shaking hands probably transmit some level of disease.

51
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,669
But in all seriousness, just like just being there is probably as bad over

52
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:18,059
Mythbusters episode

53
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:22,529
when they did the shaking hands and myth like touching and stuff.

54
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,429
I recall this and shaking hands did transmit a significant amount of

55
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,050
because people touch their faces constantly. And I mean,

56
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,820
that's like the least scary thing people touch

57
00:02:32,529 --> 00:02:32,649
Yeah,

58
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,570
like my one kid keeps scratching his butt.

59
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,110
-- I like
-- go

60
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:36,610
-- to the bathroom
-- and wash your hands.

61
00:02:36,619 --> 00:02:39,000
I think we didn't need to say that

62
00:02:39,339 --> 00:02:40,410
while he's young.

63
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,919
But, uh,

64
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,250
yeah. No.

65
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:48,570
Anyway, so Rs A so for those of you that don't know, both myself and Josh will be there.

66
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,570
And, uh,

67
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,000
so I'll be doing a talk with Kent Landfield of Intel on saving

68
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:57,009
CV E the common vulnerability and exposure database with the open source way.

69
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,570
Basically.

70
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,679
Now tell me,

71
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,490
are you focusing just on CV E or are you going to

72
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,729
work DWF into this or what's kind of your angle here?

73
00:03:04,899 --> 00:03:05,250
Well,

74
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:08,440
that's so the DWF is basically was sort of one of

75
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:10,610
the catalysts of how we're going to save CV E.

76
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,080
Uh But in general, the whole model of CV E is

77
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,300
changing to a much more open collaborative model, right?

78
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:21,619
Because like when it started back in actually 1999

79
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:25,449
it was essentially run and all the work was done by Miter,

80
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:26,179
-- right?
-- And

81
00:03:27,149 --> 00:03:28,139
Steve Christie,

82
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,399
all

83
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:29,809
of the work

84
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:30,919
who worked for me.

85
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,589
And yeah, he was, he was a workhorse, literally a workhorse. Um

86
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,990
You know, and

87
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,539
that was appropriate back then because quite frankly, you know,

88
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,710
we didn't have the buy in on CV E, you know,

89
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,750
um I remember there were competing standards like, you know,

90
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,820
bug track ID numbers and stuff like that.

91
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:46,789
Um

92
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:47,520
I think

93
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,800
nus nus I DS

94
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,360
and um so you know, basically miter kind of bootstrapped it

95
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,860
the good old fashioned way by, you know, doing all the work.

96
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,740
Um, which, and, and, you know, it's almost comical looking back like they, they,

97
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,369
for example, had a process where

98
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,100
a vulnerability would

99
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,660
-- start out as a candidate. A
-- CV N

100
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,889
and, and if it was, like, sufficiently bad

101
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,759
it would be voted on and become a real CV E

102
00:04:13,309 --> 00:04:14,520
-- which, you
-- know, Pinocchio.

103
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,459
Well, exactly. And, and, you know,

104
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,440
now with the,

105
00:04:18,565 --> 00:04:20,244
the volume of CV ES we have, that's,

106
00:04:20,515 --> 00:04:22,184
it's just impossible, right?

107
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,704
Like CV E assignments have to take less than five minutes

108
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:28,894
because we have right now. Well, last year we broke 10,000 CV S,

109
00:04:29,355 --> 00:04:34,174
right? Like, and there's a few more trickling out. So I think it's about 10,500 CV ES

110
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:35,614
last year,

111
00:04:36,084 --> 00:04:38,904
you know, and, and if they take more than five minutes to assign each, that's,

112
00:04:38,915 --> 00:04:40,265
that's a huge amount of time.

113
00:04:41,825 --> 00:04:45,184
Um, and going forward. Well, and that's basically where, where we're going is.

114
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,339
So some of the big things we're gonna be doing

115
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:50,000
in the CV world is we're moving to a Federated model

116
00:04:50,109 --> 00:04:52,260
of CV numbering authorities.

117
00:04:52,269 --> 00:04:56,809
So kind of like DNS U of Miter as the root, you know, the catch all they control it.

118
00:04:57,369 --> 00:04:58,399
And then you have these

119
00:04:58,739 --> 00:04:59,989
essentially hierarchies.

120
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,880
So for example, the D, the DWF will be the open source hierarchy.

121
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,910
So like you're dealing with open source and you want to be a CV numbering authority,

122
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,890
you come to us and we make you AC N A

123
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:14,010
uh JP Cert, the Japanese cert is also going to be

124
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,279
a hierarchy, you know, for the Japanese software market which

125
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,299
you know, that deals with the language barrier, the time zone issue,

126
00:05:20,309 --> 00:05:22,890
the cultural issues, all that, you know, boom problem solved.

127
00:05:23,149 --> 00:05:24,200
They're dealing with the,

128
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,600
like the beauty is they're dealing with JP Cert who

129
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,690
is who they've been dealing with,

130
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,450
you know,

131
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:31,679
and

132
00:05:31,929 --> 00:05:33,700
so we're going to see more of that, you know, for example,

133
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:36,329
we're looking at uh the medical device market, you know,

134
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:39,089
they're gonna need their own hierarchy with their own sort of

135
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:39,679
uh

136
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,679
flavor of CV E, you know,

137
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,420
they have slightly different requirements because they have

138
00:05:43,429 --> 00:05:45,130
a lot of regulations covering what they do.

139
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:45,470
Now,

140
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,910
is there gonna be some special way to denote the difference between a miter

141
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:55,049
CV E and say ad WF CV E and a JP Cert CV E.

142
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,820
So that's a good question.

143
00:05:56,829 --> 00:06:00,029
That's um so the provenance of the data is important because

144
00:06:00,299 --> 00:06:04,019
different CNAs will have slightly different, you know, qualities and,

145
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:05,500
and reporting requirements and stuff.

146
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:08,000
So the open source world is a good example because quite frankly,

147
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,220
most of my CV S are really easy because,

148
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,859
you know,

149
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,369
here's the line of the code,

150
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:13,540
right?

151
00:06:13,549 --> 00:06:14,470
So, you know, it's like,

152
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,260
I don't need a whole bunch of research and

153
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:17,869
proof because it's like here's the source code,

154
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,339
it's on github,

155
00:06:18,549 --> 00:06:19,489
it's this line.

156
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:21,410
Oh yeah, that's totally a buffer overflow,

157
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,739
you know. So

158
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:25,239
other, you know, close source vendors, for example,

159
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,600
you have to maybe trust them a bit more.

160
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:29,140
And so there will be um

161
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:31,589
essentially blocks of CV S,

162
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,820
right? So

163
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:33,630
Miter

164
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:36,049
will essentially, well, ultimately,

165
00:06:36,059 --> 00:06:39,179
Miter owns all the CV S and they've given the DWF, for example,

166
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,149
-- the block of 1 million to 1,999,990
-- nine.

167
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,500
Ok. Let's, uh, just in case someone doesn't know,

168
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,209
let's tell them what a CV E ID looks like.

169
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:50,410
So CV ID

170
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:56,920
historically looks like CV E hyphen year hyphen a four digit number starting at 0001

171
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:59,519
going all the way to 9999.

172
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:00,429
Obviously,

173
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,940
that was a problem because we needed more than 10,000 vulnerabilities here.

174
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,739
And so the format changed

175
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,890
and what we did simply to make it very backwards compatible is

176
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:15,769
0001 through 9999 are still a four digit number.

177
00:07:15,989 --> 00:07:20,640
And then we go straight to a six digit number and larger. So for example,

178
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:23,850
-- um,
-- or, or just do infinity, right? I think people

179
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,730
understand how,

180
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:27,769
like there's, there's no end now.

181
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:32,529
And so the idea is we assign blocks and then, you know, sub CNAs will

182
00:07:32,809 --> 00:07:33,660
have.

183
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:37,350
So for example, the DWF has a block of a million CV S and

184
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:38,399
for the sake of argument.

185
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:42,829
Yeah. Well, we might need more, but we got a lot of engineers

186
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,109
and then we can use the imaginary numbers.

187
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:48,809
And, you know, part of my goal is to make this a bit easier for people. So

188
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:52,600
my plan within the DWF is to assign essentially a static block.

189
00:07:52,609 --> 00:07:57,130
So for the sake of argument, you know, open stack becomes a CV numbering authority

190
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:59,290
and I'll give them a block of, say

191
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:03,070
100 or 1000 or how many ever CV S they're typically gonna need in a year.

192
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,859
And part of that will be is it'll make a lot easier to search for stuff because you'll,

193
00:08:07,869 --> 00:08:10,940
you know, kind of know what prefix to look for, kind of like a phone number, right?

194
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:11,519
Yeah.

195
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:12,119
And you know,

196
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:16,320
obviously blocks can be recovered if projects merge or go out of business as it were.

197
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,589
Um And you know, and that data will be kept

198
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:21,750
um but it will make life a bit simpler because also,

199
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:25,339
you know, the reality is when you give a block of numbers to somebody,

200
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,309
if you give it like currently the, the,

201
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:29,540
the way they do it is every year you get

202
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,239
like your blocks. And actually in past, you had to basically do it quarterly.

203
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,869
So you had to keep going back for more numbers.

204
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:38,840
Yeah. Or in red hat's case, I was going back to them like every month I was

205
00:08:38,989 --> 00:08:39,030
gonna

206
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,260
say, I remember at one point

207
00:08:41,489 --> 00:08:44,549
Steve was only willing to give us something like 10

208
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:47,510
or 20 at a time and literally twice a week,

209
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,700
I was begging for more.

210
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,500
I remember when I took over that job for you, I still,

211
00:08:51,885 --> 00:08:56,755
I managed to get them up to 50 then 100. And I think the biggest we got to was 500.

212
00:08:56,765 --> 00:08:57,395
I want to say,

213
00:08:57,705 --> 00:08:58,875
um something like that.

214
00:09:00,044 --> 00:09:02,534
And one thing so people may have noticed this year is

215
00:09:02,544 --> 00:09:05,145
that the CV numbers miters assigning are starting in like,

216
00:09:05,155 --> 00:09:07,125
I think it's the four or five thousands

217
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,554
because they essentially gave everybody a big block for the entire year,

218
00:09:10,565 --> 00:09:12,354
which is totally the right thing to do.

219
00:09:12,849 --> 00:09:13,330
I agree.

220
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,640
Well, and part of it too is, you know,

221
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:18,059
because we're not going to run out of numbers now because we fixed the CV

222
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,510
10-K problem. Right. And that was legitimate, you know, back in 99 right.

223
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,309
You know, I remember.

224
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:29,929
So I, I just looked here and in 1999 it looks like there were 894 CV E I DS,

225
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:32,239
which is,

226
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:33,359
I, I mean,

227
00:09:33,369 --> 00:09:35,070
I guess for the year that that's a pretty

228
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,309
impressive number given in 1999 nobody cared about security.

229
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,869
-- For the most part,
-- we literally had like bug track and maybe

230
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:44,140
I

231
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:44,450
was gonna

232
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:44,590
say

233
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,400
full disclosure,

234
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,640
full disclosure was,

235
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,190
yeah. Yeah, full disclosure probably came out. It's been around a long time.

236
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,010
I feel like

237
00:09:52,849 --> 00:09:54,840
I bet I subscribe to most of that stuff.

238
00:09:54,849 --> 00:09:58,750
It would have been about 9495 and I started to care and I'm

239
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,150
pretty sure full disclosure has been around for most of that time.

240
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,440
I do know Bug Trek was

241
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,140
and there was even, oh

242
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:07,700
man, I can't even remember some of the other mailing lists. Now it was

243
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:08,969
uh

244
00:10:09,099 --> 00:10:09,559
there was

245
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:09,679
a,

246
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,130
there, there were, there were a handful and, and none were great for the most part

247
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:16,419
closure archives go back to 2002.

248
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:16,799
Well, no, no,

249
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:18,700
that's the new full disclosure because remember there was

250
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:21,489
the old full disclosure that was shut down and then

251
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:23,609
somebody started up the new one.

252
00:10:24,369 --> 00:10:24,609
Yeah,

253
00:10:24,989 --> 00:10:27,289
Larry Rosen was the original one if memory serves

254
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:29,250
and he got sick of just being

255
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:32,632
like, treated very poorly, which I mean, I kind of get it right.

256
00:10:32,643 --> 00:10:32,773
It's,

257
00:10:32,783 --> 00:10:36,043
you're very much the messenger in that instance and there's not a

258
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:41,263
good answer to running a mailing list filled with zero day vulnerabilities.

259
00:10:41,562 --> 00:10:43,603
Well, and this was back in the day too where, you know,

260
00:10:43,612 --> 00:10:46,182
there was talk of suing and lots of, you know,

261
00:10:46,192 --> 00:10:48,643
this is back when vulnerabilities were really, really scary.

262
00:10:48,653 --> 00:10:49,783
And then we learned that, no,

263
00:10:49,895 --> 00:10:51,156
this is just how life is.

264
00:10:52,056 --> 00:10:53,195
You know, it's like car accidents there.

265
00:10:53,205 --> 00:10:56,536
It's just a thing like the police don't even come to accidents now, unless it's,

266
00:10:56,546 --> 00:10:58,255
you know, there's enough damage or people are hurt,

267
00:10:58,265 --> 00:11:01,346
they're just like whatever you can report it online if it's under two grand now.

268
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,426
That's right. So, so tell me about your talk.

269
00:11:03,435 --> 00:11:05,466
-- We're kind of getting, getting ourselves
-- into the weed here.

270
00:11:05,476 --> 00:11:07,395
So we're gonna be talking about how we are

271
00:11:07,406 --> 00:11:09,575
basically saving CV with the open source way.

272
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:10,395
And, um,

273
00:11:10,926 --> 00:11:13,945
the biggest takeaway is we're gonna really teach

274
00:11:13,955 --> 00:11:16,195
people what they can do to get involved,

275
00:11:16,445 --> 00:11:18,825
you know, with respect to becoming a CV mentor

276
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:23,309
and, or becoming a CV numbering authority and how that whole process works.

277
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,520
And we've, I've greatly simplified it now like a

278
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:25,750
three

279
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:26,690
step process.

280
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,400
The CV E mentors exist yet.

281
00:11:28,409 --> 00:11:31,049
-- I know you've been talking about it, but they don't
-- exist yet,

282
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:34,489
but they will hopefully in the next uh they'll start existing in the next week or two.

283
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,809
Nice. Very cool. And um so we have a list essentially of people who are

284
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,059
basically, it boils down to train to do two things. Number one,

285
00:11:42,229 --> 00:11:43,780
is this a vulnerability? Yes or no.

286
00:11:43,789 --> 00:11:47,030
And number two, how to assign the CV E counting rules to it?

287
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:47,700
Like how we,

288
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:51,690
because we actually sort of pragmatically smush some vulnerabilities together.

289
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,090
Like if you find a big pile of cross site scripting vulnerabilities

290
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,659
in one piece of software in the same version, then

291
00:11:56,929 --> 00:12:00,690
there's no real value in having a lot of CV S just one will cover it, you know,

292
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,619
assuming they all get fixed in the same patch.

293
00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:04,260
I remember,

294
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,020
you know,

295
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,450
and that's basically it. And then

296
00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:12,250
the beauty is this will allow organizations to uh use a CV numbering authority

297
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,419
to either get a CV E number like when they need one or

298
00:12:16,859 --> 00:12:19,599
to get the CV, mentor to sign off on the request

299
00:12:20,099 --> 00:12:21,280
and then they can hold on to it.

300
00:12:21,289 --> 00:12:23,719
And then when they actually want the CV number,

301
00:12:23,729 --> 00:12:25,900
like say they wanted an hour before disclosure,

302
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,890
they can just submit that signed request. And essentially,

303
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,140
you know, we'll look at it and be like, yeah,

304
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,859
that's a properly signed request by Josh Pressers, for example, we trust them.

305
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:35,159
So boom, here's your CV,

306
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,400
right?

307
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:39,950
And that handles the uh the embargo issue because the one of the problems

308
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,109
with the signing CV S is when it's a public issue super easy,

309
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:43,260
right?

310
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:46,440
You ask for a CV, I give you the CV, I put the information in the database

311
00:12:46,619 --> 00:12:47,119
done.

312
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,729
But what if you need an embargoed CV for an issue that's not

313
00:12:50,739 --> 00:12:53,830
yet public and maybe won't be public for hours or days or weeks?

314
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:55,739
You know, I don't want to have to hold on to

315
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,390
secret information and like

316
00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:02,179
-- make sure I don't disclose it until the right time.
-- So you're pushing this,

317
00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:05,140
I guess responsibility

318
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:08,619
onto the mentor to sign off on.

319
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,070
Well, they don't have to keep the information around.

320
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,049
See, that's the beauty of it, right? They just sign the record

321
00:13:13,369 --> 00:13:16,400
and then they can forget about it. It's not their problem anymore.

322
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,299
Interesting

323
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:21,109
because there's really no need for the CV mentor to keep that information,

324
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:21,520
right?

325
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:24,900
So they don't have to worry about holding and handling private information now.

326
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:28,520
Well, I mean, you say that, but when people send

327
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,799
information,

328
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,400
be it email or instant messaging or whatever,

329
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:36,799
it's often difficult to keep them secure.

330
00:13:37,229 --> 00:13:38,119
Well, true.

331
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:42,130
So for example, if they use um well, one requirement will obviously be that,

332
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,830
you know, signed requests are well signed using GP G.

333
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,280
Uh which means of course, every CV mentor has to have a, you know, a working GP G key,

334
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:52,099
which means people can send them encrypted email and you can just

335
00:13:52,109 --> 00:13:54,900
have the encrypted email sitting in your mailbox and reply to it

336
00:13:55,059 --> 00:13:58,559
-- with a signed message. And you're done so very
-- simple,

337
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,080
very simple. Yes. As we

338
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:05,099
talked about how terrible P GP is what, three episodes ago?

339
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,049
It's, you know,

340
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:09,400
these are people who are somewhat hopefully security knowledgeable.

341
00:14:09,409 --> 00:14:09,520
That's

342
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,169
-- probably
-- fair, you know, and this is

343
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,640
I, I can't really find a better way to do it, to be honest.

344
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:16,210
-- And I've thought about this quite a bit uh
-- signal. Yo

345
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:16,679
uh

346
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:21,719
the problem with signal is um what if I need to send you some sort of file artifact,

347
00:14:21,729 --> 00:14:23,460
you can send files over signal, right?

348
00:14:23,469 --> 00:14:26,630
But then the person now has that file artifact on their system.

349
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,590
So they'd have to encrypt it anyways to keep it secure.

350
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,820
-- Yes.
-- See, that's the problem.

351
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:33,200
No, but that's

352
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,369
nonsense. Because

353
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:39,419
if you send me an artifact with GP G, I'm going to have to decrypt it

354
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:41,440
somehow on disk

355
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:44,760
to do something with it. I mean, I know. Yeah. Yeah. There's things I can do without,

356
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,570
-- I
-- think into the details here.

357
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,190
It, but fundamentally, you know,

358
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,770
there has to be a simple secure communications channel

359
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,650
and here's the reality, everybody has email,

360
00:14:54,869 --> 00:14:56,820
not everybody has a cell phone or more importantly,

361
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:00,450
like me is I'm definitely not giving my cell phone out to random people.

362
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,299
I used to be like that.

363
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:04,669
I've given up like my cell phone number at this point is like my email address.

364
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:05,960
It's not even hard to find

365
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,250
my cell phone number.

366
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,900
You know what that's asking for trouble. But

367
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:12,719
if you want to,

368
00:15:12,729 --> 00:15:15,679
you can email me or message me on Twitter and I will give

369
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,260
it to you and then you can send me messages on signal,

370
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:18,909
for example.

371
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:22,799
And in fact, there was, I remember there was one time I saw a

372
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,400
support person

373
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,599
at a conference was talking about, you know,

374
00:15:26,609 --> 00:15:28,960
how important it is to contact customers and stuff.

375
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:29,409
And

376
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:32,340
he, he put his cell phone number up on the, on the slide

377
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,250
and said this is my number and this guy is like a VP of, of customer support at this,

378
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:36,919
this place.

379
00:15:37,619 --> 00:15:38,520
And he did that.

380
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,059
And then after like five minutes, he's like,

381
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,520
I have to turn my cellphone off now because

382
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:44,599
people kept calling him while he's on stage.

383
00:15:44,729 --> 00:15:45,429
And that's,

384
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,250
it's that quality of life issue. Right.

385
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:51,119
I don't, I, I prefer to use my cell phone as little as possible for incoming calls

386
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:52,679
unless it's people I know.

387
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:57,719
-- And I like, but,
-- but here's the thing too is if I give it out too easily,

388
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,380
it would be

389
00:15:59,489 --> 00:16:01,820
potentially someone could use it just to cause trouble.

390
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,380
But basically I,

391
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,979
if you want to get a hold of me and you go look for it and it's not hard to find,

392
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:09,500
then you have a purpose. So I'm less concerned in that instance.

393
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,419
So, well, it, it seems weaselly of me to say this and then not, not give it out on,

394
00:16:13,429 --> 00:16:14,809
on the podcast.

395
00:16:14,859 --> 00:16:20,450
There, there is a method to demand. So anyway, OK, so you're at CBE talk if I show up

396
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,340
and I say I wanna be a mentor at the end.

397
00:16:23,619 --> 00:16:24,169
Mhm

398
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:25,080
Is it gonna happen?

399
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:28,309
Hopefully by then I'll have the website up and running.

400
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,000
Um But essentially to become a CV mentor, the absolute minimum

401
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:35,080
process is essentially you have to have a working email address,

402
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,669
you have to have a GP G key.

403
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:41,559
Uh that doesn't expire anytime soon. Like I don't want to deal with

404
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:41,950
all of them

405
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,359
ideally. Yeah, that'll work. Um

406
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:46,234
And then essentially you're gonna have to take

407
00:16:46,244 --> 00:16:48,135
a little bit of training on essentially,

408
00:16:48,145 --> 00:16:50,294
you know, by miters and CV E standards.

409
00:16:50,304 --> 00:16:51,875
Is this a vulnerability? Yes or no?

410
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,674
Because quite often, some of these things are more security hardening.

411
00:16:54,695 --> 00:16:56,724
So they don't, you know, they're security related

412
00:16:56,965 --> 00:16:59,184
but they don't actually qualify for a CV E.

413
00:16:59,854 --> 00:17:03,265
Um, there's some rules around sort of what is, and is not covered and how we do that,

414
00:17:03,275 --> 00:17:05,675
you know, just sort of some housekeeping stuff and,

415
00:17:06,084 --> 00:17:07,395
and the, uh, the CV,

416
00:17:07,405 --> 00:17:10,635
counting rules around how we split and merge vulnerabilities to make sure that,

417
00:17:10,645 --> 00:17:12,594
you know, the CV S are kind of applied correctly.

418
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:13,949
Um

419
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:16,790
And then, you know, a little bit of basic process where essentially,

420
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,130
well, basically the two ways you do CV assignments are you either

421
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,569
um assign them sort of in real time

422
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,189
and give the data, you know, back to the parent uh numbering authority

423
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:31,140
or you sign off on this request and give it to a person who can then, you know,

424
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,750
use that signed request to get a CV later on like when they need it.

425
00:17:35,439 --> 00:17:36,150
And um

426
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,630
-- that's basically
-- it, that seems remarkably simple to do.

427
00:17:39,949 --> 00:17:40,250
Yeah.

428
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,670
And the only other thing is so there,

429
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:46,660
there will be a public registry of these uh CV mentors and all it is is the, the name

430
00:17:47,069 --> 00:17:49,810
and when I say name, the name they want to be known by,

431
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,010
like I don't care if it's Fluffy bunny 69.

432
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,729
Um I really don't

433
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,119
uh they have to have a uh like a primary

434
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,589
and a backup email address because like one thing I

435
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:02,099
run into is people use like their work email address

436
00:18:02,189 --> 00:18:04,699
and then they move somewhere else like companies or whatever.

437
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,869
And then they're like, oh, it's me, trust me, it's me.

438
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,790
And I'm like, well, I can't really verify that.

439
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:12,189
So I, you know, they'll have to submit two email addresses which let's face it.

440
00:18:12,199 --> 00:18:15,369
Everybody at this point has at least two emails, a work one and a private one.

441
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,719
Or you just set up a Gmail account again, I don't care.

442
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:20,589
I just, I want a way to reach you when your primary address goes bonkers.

443
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,920
Um optionally, they can also, you know,

444
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,319
I'll let them submit like their linkedin or

445
00:18:25,329 --> 00:18:27,339
Facebook profile or whatever if they want.

446
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,300
Um

447
00:18:28,459 --> 00:18:31,219
Because ironically that's something that like people never change.

448
00:18:31,229 --> 00:18:33,130
Like once they set that up, they keep it for life

449
00:18:33,469 --> 00:18:36,439
and then you have to submit a copy of your GP G key

450
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,410
and then there's a little bit of information on sort of whether or not,

451
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:39,839
yeah,

452
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,589
your public key obviously.

453
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:44,689
Uh And then there's a little bit of information to confirm that you've taken

454
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,859
uh the training on, you know, yes or no.

455
00:18:46,869 --> 00:18:49,959
Is that a vulnerability uh how to do split and merge?

456
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,880
Uh whether or not you've agreed to like the terms of

457
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:56,520
use the contributors agreement and the uh the CN A guidelines.

458
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,069
So basically, you have to like, just agree to the rules,

459
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,829
you know, the community rules and whatnot.

460
00:19:01,979 --> 00:19:04,040
Uh And that's the minimum and then also, for example,

461
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:07,739
some people will choose to uh also provide training.

462
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,510
So, you know, you might

463
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,500
um because there will be CV, mentors, for example, that don't do CV S,

464
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:14,839
they might just do the training primarily and train other CV mentors.

465
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:17,160
You know, that's, that's one of my personal goals.

466
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:20,439
I don't actually want to do CV, si just wanna create people who are CV mentors.

467
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:23,579
Um So optionally, there'll be people who are, you know,

468
00:19:23,589 --> 00:19:25,920
trained on how to give the training and

469
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,859
they in turn will be able to help create CV mentors, right?

470
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:29,959
Because we got to scale this out.

471
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,599
Um So essentially, my goal is to make it look kind of like the Linux kernel, right?

472
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:36,900
You have subsystem maintainers who have their own little groups of people

473
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,060
that they know and trust and validate and

474
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:42,989
you know, stuff feeds up hill and well, you know, I trust Bob.

475
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,500
Bob, trust, Alice, Alice trusts Eve, therefore, Eve's OK.

476
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:49,670
This is sounding remarkably like the GP G web of trust, Kurt.

477
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:49,920
It

478
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,989
is except it's actually a small community. It's not some random group of

479
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:55,699
-- people.
-- That's true. It's not random.

480
00:19:55,849 --> 00:19:56,160
You need

481
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,020
some level

482
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,619
and fundamentally like for CV, mentors to work, well,

483
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,880
we have to be able to find each other.

484
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,920
Like people have to be able to find you. It's true,

485
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:03,709
right?

486
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,010
Otherwise it's just not going to work.

487
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,500
Um And then optionally in the,

488
00:20:07,849 --> 00:20:10,250
you can also declare sort of what your specialties or interests are.

489
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,319
So, for example,

490
00:20:11,449 --> 00:20:15,199
you know, I know one guy who, like, he writes firewall or a VPN software,

491
00:20:15,209 --> 00:20:17,739
so he's probably gonna specialize in like VPN and crypto because

492
00:20:17,949 --> 00:20:21,959
especially when he asked for CV S, I'm kind of like, uh, those,

493
00:20:21,969 --> 00:20:23,410
I recognize some of those words.

494
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,800
Sure. Here's your CV E

495
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:25,369
I,

496
00:20:25,569 --> 00:20:29,489
you know, III, I don't want to spend six hours like rereading, applied crypto

497
00:20:29,939 --> 00:20:30,819
to, you know.

498
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,410
Right. Right.

499
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:35,829
Understand what his email said in depth. You know, it's, it's a trust thing, right?

500
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:36,630
And fundamentally,

501
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,609
if a CV E assignment goes wrong, we just reject

502
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,640
it. And that's the most important part of this I think.

503
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:47,609
And this is something actually that, that Miter struggled with for a long time is

504
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,449
people are gonna make mistakes. It's never gonna be perfect.

505
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:52,829
And so you just make sure your system can deal

506
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:56,599
with mistakes which the old CBE system really couldn't do.

507
00:20:57,829 --> 00:21:00,530
And you know, so, yeah, I mean, that's basically what it boils down to.

508
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,930
Um I'm also gonna talk a bit about where I'm currently working on the new,

509
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:08,819
uh I'm now on to the fourth version of the uh data format we're gonna be using.

510
00:21:09,219 --> 00:21:11,449
Um, so we've iterated quite a few times and it's,

511
00:21:11,459 --> 00:21:13,530
it's a good time for us to iterate because basically

512
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,790
nobody's using it except for Miter and uh Nist. So

513
00:21:16,949 --> 00:21:18,770
you should take a bet

514
00:21:18,979 --> 00:21:26,630
and say when Rs A 2018 rolls around. What version of the data set will you be on?

515
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:29,869
Well, we're going to do again back to what uh

516
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,729
Glynis did we,

517
00:21:30,849 --> 00:21:32,599
well, back in the day we're going to do even a number.

518
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,640
So the event

519
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,280
4.0 will be like the stable stream

520
00:21:36,699 --> 00:21:39,329
and then we'll have a 5.0 for experimental.

521
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:43,979
I bet you're going to be on version 10 in a year.

522
00:21:44,699 --> 00:21:48,089
I my hope is to rapidly iterate and

523
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:51,670
the only time we'll actually have to bump from like version

524
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,890
4 to 6 is if we make an incompatible change.

525
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,729
So we either require something new that must be there or

526
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,339
we remove something that used to be required.

527
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:02,430
10,

528
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,569
here's the dirty secret

529
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:08,579
for Miter to accept a CV E

530
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,069
uh assignment from somebody.

531
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,420
They actually only require five pieces of information.

532
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:16,250
And that is the CV V number. Obviously, you have to have that

533
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:20,560
you have to have the vendor and the product like that's affected, right?

534
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,359
Sure.

535
00:22:21,589 --> 00:22:26,729
What the problem type is like buffer overflow XSS, whatever.

536
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:27,900
Um

537
00:22:28,739 --> 00:22:33,000
And I'm blanking on the fifth one. Wow, my brain just walked up completely.

538
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,229
It must not be important that

539
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:35,479
anyway.

540
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,229
So the point is, you know, this isn't rocket science.

541
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:41,829
No, it really isn't. So that, that's really cool. That's really fun.

542
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:43,369
The description of the vulnerable

543
00:22:43,589 --> 00:22:44,609
description of course.

544
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,050
Yeah,

545
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:45,790
literally.

546
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:47,280
So

547
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,719
very exciting. And your, your file format is

548
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,280
JSON, which means it is

549
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:52,930
very

550
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:53,430
easy to

551
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:59,354
um the only catch being is uh you will want to or not want to,

552
00:22:59,364 --> 00:23:02,375
you will have to also support Unicode because you know, like JP, sir,

553
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:06,234
those Japanese guys, they would like to use their language.

554
00:23:06,265 --> 00:23:09,494
There's no reason not to do unicode these days.

555
00:23:09,604 --> 00:23:10,185
I'm just gonna,

556
00:23:11,505 --> 00:23:11,584
I

557
00:23:11,854 --> 00:23:11,885
would

558
00:23:12,025 --> 00:23:12,165
fully

559
00:23:12,444 --> 00:23:17,135
-- agree. Now,
-- if you ever want to experience nailing your hand to the wall,

560
00:23:17,425 --> 00:23:20,614
you should try doing unicode in Python two.

561
00:23:21,209 --> 00:23:21,910
It is

562
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:24,869
the most ridiculous horrible process

563
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,630
ever.

564
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:26,140
Yeah.

565
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:31,569
And yeah, I mean, that's gonna be unfortunate for me because I mostly live in Python.

566
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:32,099
But, um,

567
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,400
realistically it's, it's, you know, it's text,

568
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:38,079
it's like strings of descriptions of the vulnerability and stuff.

569
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:40,219
It's, you know, again, it's really not rocket science.

570
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:46,520
-- I'm
-- going to turn myself into a new security researcher whose name is Snowman.

571
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:51,410
Snowman Airplane just to watch all of the various CV E

572
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:55,920
tracking applications fail when they try to parse my name.

573
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,449
Yeah. No, it's, it's gonna happen. Right. I mean,

574
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,280
I've often wondered, you know, how long,

575
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,660
well, there was actually the case of, there was a CV E

576
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:08,369
where in the description they put, um, an example of the regular expression

577
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:13,829
that caused the problem and it actually made, uh, one of the vendors CV systems,

578
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:14,239
like,

579
00:24:14,709 --> 00:24:17,510
really choked hard on it and did not like

580
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:17,900
it.

581
00:24:18,349 --> 00:24:18,949
I love it.

582
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,670
And that's the other thing to remember too. Right?

583
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,939
Is because we're going to have you know,

584
00:24:21,949 --> 00:24:24,290
descriptions might have like an example of regular

585
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,290
expression or some mangled unicode or whatever.

586
00:24:27,989 --> 00:24:30,650
Um And that's the other good news we're gonna have test data.

587
00:24:31,699 --> 00:24:31,849
What

588
00:24:31,949 --> 00:24:32,310
is that? I

589
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:32,530
know

590
00:24:33,349 --> 00:24:36,540
we're literally, we're, uh it looks like right now,

591
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,390
what we're gonna do is set aside a block of CV S

592
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:43,079
and essentially we'll have a block of test CV ES that are like intentionally

593
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:45,530
slightly mangled like, but within the spec, right?

594
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:49,109
So they're like, man, like very, maybe a lot of nested data or a

595
00:24:49,329 --> 00:24:53,630
-- whole bunch of like, yeah, poop emojis in the title or whatever.
-- I like what I hear.

596
00:24:53,939 --> 00:24:55,270
Um And so essentially,

597
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,550
that'll be kind of like your for like unit testing and

598
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,560
stuff like essentially if you can parse all of those valid,

599
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:03,890
but you know, ugly CV S, then your system is probably gonna be OK.

600
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,599
And you know, ideally as we

601
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:10,780
find more, you know, cases where somebody submits a CV that makes the system break,

602
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,069
we'll add that to the test data.

603
00:25:12,849 --> 00:25:15,209
And then there will additionally be sort of a set of reserve numbers

604
00:25:15,219 --> 00:25:17,949
for like internal testing because part of it too is with CV,

605
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:19,589
we're, we're moving towards automation,

606
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:23,079
which means I'm going to want to test my system and generate a bunch of

607
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:25,390
CV S and then hand it over to your system and see what happens.

608
00:25:26,369 --> 00:25:27,060
We

609
00:25:27,219 --> 00:25:31,910
don't want to run the risk of maybe those weird CV S escaping into the wild as it were.

610
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,349
But if they do escape into the wild,

611
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:37,170
they'll be using numbers that are registered as being like, these are test CV S.

612
00:25:37,199 --> 00:25:40,010
If you see them in the wild, ignore them. They're not real,

613
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,209
you know, because

614
00:25:41,349 --> 00:25:42,829
people will need to, for example,

615
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:46,989
create CV s with like really high impact ratings to test that their CV E, you know,

616
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,189
munching system

617
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:50,000
sends out a phone alert saying, hey,

618
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:52,869
I just saw the CV with a really high rating that affects something we use.

619
00:25:53,209 --> 00:25:53,619
Right.

620
00:25:54,109 --> 00:25:55,469
-- Yeah,
-- and that makes sense.

621
00:25:55,849 --> 00:25:56,140
Yeah.

622
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:59,489
And so essentially we'll have that testing ability which will help lead,

623
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,680
uh towards the automation stuff that we're working on.

624
00:26:01,689 --> 00:26:08,339
You should, uh, use 19216811 as the first test CV E ID.

625
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:11,140
-- Uh,
-- we probably wanna use the 900,000 range.

626
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,020
-- Yeah,
-- that's, that's cool and make sure, don't forget to have a test CV ID.

627
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,780
That's like 30 digits long.

628
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,099
Uh, well, we already have those, uh, for the, the CV E

629
00:26:20,349 --> 00:26:21,670
10-K stuff they issued like,

630
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:25,420
uh CV E, what was it like 11,000,

631
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:28,030
uh, like 123456.

632
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,359
I think some, you know, a couple, there's about 13 or 14 CV S like that,

633
00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:31,989
that they issue,

634
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,119
you need to make sure one

635
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:37,500
exceeds the 32 bit integer maximum value

636
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,290
because, you know, something will break

637
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:41,829
and

638
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,310
maybe, maybe if you really want it to be exciting,

639
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:48,630
you could exceed the 64 bit integer value, but we'll, we'll let that one go probably.

640
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,180
Um, well, I actually have a plan for that.

641
00:26:52,489 --> 00:26:53,859
That will scale better.

642
00:26:54,439 --> 00:26:55,880
But, um, anyways,

643
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:58,300
so, yeah, we'll have, you know, long term,

644
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,810
uh, CV, is getting a lot more healthy.

645
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,579
We're making a lot of changes that needed to be changed.

646
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:06,300
I mean, one of the beautiful things is last year. I mean, they minted,

647
00:27:06,969 --> 00:27:09,670
I think it was like a dozen new CN CV numbering authorities.

648
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:09,790
You know,

649
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,969
there's like a lot of new CV numbering authorities

650
00:27:11,979 --> 00:27:14,550
like the Apache Foundation and heck even Larry Cash

651
00:27:14,939 --> 00:27:15,849
dollar like Larry Cash,

652
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:19,229
-- Daler himself is a CV numbering authority. You know,
-- that's

653
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,500
human.

654
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:25,329
He's the only individually that is officially their own CNA I guess.

655
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:27,400
I mean, technically I quasi

656
00:27:27,589 --> 00:27:29,069
am but not officially,

657
00:27:29,459 --> 00:27:32,920
but no, he is like, he's the, he's a one man CN A literally.

658
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:33,660
And I mean,

659
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,400
he also holds the record for like one year

660
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:38,560
skewing the entire stats for the CV numbering system.

661
00:27:39,229 --> 00:27:39,709
Uh

662
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:44,459
-- You know, he went through um what was it? Um
-- He did the, it was Jumla,

663
00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:45,390
right.

664
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:48,729
Yeah. And well, and just other plugins and whatnot and just found

665
00:27:48,969 --> 00:27:49,680
gazillions of

666
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:50,969
you gotta think.

667
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:55,380
Now I actually, I read a statistic the other day that, that N PM,

668
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:59,939
the node Js package manager has 40,000 packages in it.

669
00:27:59,949 --> 00:28:00,339
Now,

670
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:05,459
you gotta think that is a bare minimum of 40,000 security issues.

671
00:28:05,469 --> 00:28:08,300
Probably magnitudes more.

672
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,260
Well, yeah, same last time I

673
00:28:10,479 --> 00:28:12,489
Ruby Gems, it was 54,000

674
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:13,969
and

675
00:28:14,689 --> 00:28:17,849
was about 50,000 as well. Like, there's

676
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:21,250
a lot of software now. Like, that's just the reality of it.

677
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:21,560
A

678
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:27,109
lot of terrible software. Now, let's admit it. Most of it is awful.

679
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:30,349
And these people don't even know what security issues are now.

680
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:33,089
Mind you, I'm not blaming the people. It's not their fault.

681
00:28:33,099 --> 00:28:34,770
They don't know, they just don't.

682
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:36,489
It's crazy.

683
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:38,290
And that's a good point.

684
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:42,680
Actually, this totally leads into what I'm talking about at RS A.

685
00:28:42,689 --> 00:28:46,040
So I'm gonna steal your spotlight now because I can.

686
00:28:46,449 --> 00:28:48,599
And so I'm doing a peer to peer session

687
00:28:48,849 --> 00:28:51,180
on managing your open source.

688
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:51,939
And

689
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:55,640
the challenge here is the way I like to say it is open source one.

690
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:59,650
So literally, you are using open source in your organization,

691
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:00,959
you either know it

692
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:02,489
or you don't know.

693
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,319
And you are,

694
00:29:03,329 --> 00:29:05,969
there's no like secret option three where you're not using

695
00:29:05,979 --> 00:29:09,469
open source and that's basically accepted today in the universe.

696
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:11,829
At least everywhere I've gone, everyone I've talked to,

697
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,199
they understand that this is real.

698
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:17,439
But the problem now is if you have all this open source everywhere, you know,

699
00:29:17,449 --> 00:29:19,839
in the instance of like N PM is a great example.

700
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:23,119
What are your developers using? Where are they getting this stuff from?

701
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:26,020
Is it any good? Can you trust it? Should you trust it?

702
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,520
And how are you gonna take care of it?

703
00:29:27,829 --> 00:29:32,290
And this is true of there, there's kind of two sides to this discussion.

704
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,050
There's the developer side

705
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,449
which is obviously, you know, things like pulling stuff out of N PM, for example,

706
00:29:37,689 --> 00:29:40,290
but there's also the operation side where you think there's

707
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,170
guys running Linux distributions where they get them from.

708
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:46,609
There are people using containers they found under the rug.

709
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,530
You've got people who might say, you know,

710
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:51,500
we need these 12 libraries to make this application work and they just

711
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:54,410
literally like type it into Google and download the first thing they find.

712
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:55,439
And

713
00:29:55,569 --> 00:29:59,819
so part of the, the, the challenge for the security folks is like, what do we do now?

714
00:29:59,829 --> 00:30:02,939
We've got all this crap everywhere. How do we start taking care of it?

715
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:07,930
And so the, the idea is it's meant to be a very discussion oriented session

716
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:08,780
where,

717
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:12,510
you know, come with ideas and we can discuss what works, what doesn't work,

718
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,530
kind of kind of how it's going.

719
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:17,140
And my job is to basically just keep the train on the tracks essentially.

720
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,680
So one thing I'm curious, have you found that cloud has impacted this?

721
00:30:20,689 --> 00:30:23,079
Because I, I find with cloud, one of the biggest things is

722
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:26,930
people have realized, yeah, I'll go to my IT department and ask but if they say no,

723
00:30:26,939 --> 00:30:28,319
I'm just gonna go do it anyways.

724
00:30:28,449 --> 00:30:28,599
I

725
00:30:28,709 --> 00:30:31,189
don't even think it's that man. I think like Dev

726
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:32,560
ops is

727
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,650
really changing the face of all of this. And

728
00:30:35,979 --> 00:30:39,880
I know the discussion we've had in the past is it's pets versus cattle,

729
00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:41,319
right? Where

730
00:30:41,689 --> 00:30:43,989
it's difficult to shoot your dog.

731
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:48,890
If it's a cow, you're happy to, to turn that into a hamburger. And so

732
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,020
I, I think Dev

733
00:30:50,189 --> 00:30:52,939
Ops is kind of seeing that where people are becoming less,

734
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:53,859
uh,

735
00:30:53,869 --> 00:30:58,680
reliant on systems that are kind of carefully constructed and make

736
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:01,239
sense and it's moving to something that's a little more quick.

737
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:04,369
And I think the impact Cloud has from what I see is

738
00:31:04,689 --> 00:31:06,079
if you do it right.

739
00:31:06,189 --> 00:31:11,030
And I'm putting a huge asterisk next to that because most people aren't.

740
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,310
But if you do it right,

741
00:31:12,849 --> 00:31:15,400
you can move quickly enough that you don't have

742
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,599
to worry about a lot of these security issues

743
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:21,250
as long as your developers are are doing the right thing,

744
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,790
stuff like when you rebuild a container you use,

745
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,050
make sure you're refreshing all of the software there.

746
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:32,229
It's not like, you know, you get cloned and forget about it. You can't do that.

747
00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:34,520
You have to keep updating this stuff and

748
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:37,390
keep testing for changes that you care about.

749
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,989
So yeah, it's, it's crazy days, man. I mean,

750
00:31:40,339 --> 00:31:42,030
uh where it ends up. I don't know.

751
00:31:42,209 --> 00:31:42,719
And

752
00:31:42,989 --> 00:31:45,680
there's scanning software that can help with some of this.

753
00:31:45,689 --> 00:31:48,099
There's, there's various vendors that do some things,

754
00:31:48,109 --> 00:31:50,949
-- there's people who manage software, speaking
-- of that,

755
00:31:51,089 --> 00:31:52,880
uh you're familiar with Black

756
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:53,430
Doc,

757
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,359
I am

758
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:58,229
-- Uh So maybe you could explain to our listeners kind of what Black Duck is,
-- right?

759
00:31:58,239 --> 00:32:00,199
So Black Duck is a software company

760
00:32:00,609 --> 00:32:02,989
that actually they made their kind of claim to fame

761
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,829
was looking for open source software in your product.

762
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:08,329
Because again, this comes back to the manage open source.

763
00:32:08,339 --> 00:32:11,280
There was once a day when including open source in

764
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:14,599
your application was seen as a dangerous thing to do

765
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,760
where you wanted to make sure there was

766
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:19,479
no open source in the product you were releasing

767
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:22,550
or if there was, it had to have a nice license.

768
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,010
Now, people like e don't care whatever full of open source I can live with it.

769
00:32:26,089 --> 00:32:28,280
So now the challenge though, and this is what blackjack

770
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:31,920
is doing today is basically scanning the open source and saying

771
00:32:32,189 --> 00:32:36,880
which bits of this open source are outdated and which bits of this are OK.

772
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,069
And they even have the granularity where they could tell you like individual CV E

773
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:46,020
I DS affecting a specific package that you might have included in your product.

774
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,800
So it can do some really cool stuff actually.

775
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,880
And so a nice piece of news there is Black Duck

776
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:54,089
has been nominated for membership on the CV E board.

777
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,170
Uh We're currently in the voting period

778
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,270
but so far everybody's been positive because

779
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:02,969
like quite clearly Black Duck are a sane people and B doing useful work.

780
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:05,890
Well, no, no, no, not everybody's saying that's something you, I mean,

781
00:33:05,979 --> 00:33:08,329
for anybody who's in the security community you're

782
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:09,500
like shaking your head and you're going,

783
00:33:10,579 --> 00:33:12,609
and everybody outside the security community is like, yeah, I hate them.

784
00:33:12,619 --> 00:33:13,329
They're all insane.

785
00:33:13,819 --> 00:33:14,300
Um,

786
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:18,619
yeah, I mean, they do good work and, um, yeah, so they're going to be on the CV board,

787
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:19,530
which I love because

788
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:23,369
one of the challenges is, you know, CV E usage has grown.

789
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:26,119
It's, it's, you know, become the de facto standard

790
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,810
and there's a lot of stuff going on that, you know,

791
00:33:28,819 --> 00:33:32,569
wasn't planned in 99 or even in 2010 or even last year.

792
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:33,849
You know, and it's

793
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:34,040
a

794
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,119
funny story for you.

795
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:40,829
There is you talk about CV E usage is the standard now and I remember in probably 0506,

796
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:41,469
give or take,

797
00:33:42,069 --> 00:33:44,369
there were open source projects I would work with

798
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:49,040
that didn't understand why they should worry about CV E I DS

799
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:53,849
and well, no, no, I mean, large ones, we'll say, ok, like

800
00:33:54,209 --> 00:33:55,829
I'm not going to throw them under the bus,

801
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:59,869
but everybody knows the name of some of these organizations, right?

802
00:34:00,089 --> 00:34:03,140
And I remember it reached a point where I'm like, look, you guys don't have to care,

803
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,050
but I'm assigning I DS.

804
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:04,430
All right.

805
00:34:04,439 --> 00:34:08,250
And we came to the mutual agreement of they didn't want them,

806
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,399
but they were getting them anyway.

807
00:34:09,478 --> 00:34:12,889
And of course, for the most part, people all all understand this now.

808
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:14,820
But yeah, I mean, I, I remember that man, it was

809
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:15,800
still,

810
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:20,310
is the case with some vendors, they really don't want CV S because they,

811
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,750
they think CV S are, you know, a negative reflection on them.

812
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,510
And part of the model we're gonna be moving to is, you know, the simple question is,

813
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:27,639
do you

814
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:29,629
want as a consumer software,

815
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,679
do you want people to have CV S assigned to

816
00:34:31,688 --> 00:34:33,560
all their vulnerabilities whether they like it or not?

817
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,899
And resoundingly the answer I've heard is yes.

818
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:39,219
And that's gonna be one of the things we're looking at how to do,

819
00:34:39,928 --> 00:34:40,388
you know,

820
00:34:40,638 --> 00:34:43,529
well and properly for the CV, whole ecosystem.

821
00:34:44,197 --> 00:34:46,839
You know, how do we make sure we have coverage especially, you know,

822
00:34:46,849 --> 00:34:50,829
true today though, you can get a CV ID assigned to a piece of software,

823
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:53,739
-- whether the vendor wants it
-- or not, but we want to make it easier

824
00:34:54,168 --> 00:34:54,438
and like,

825
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:55,868
yeah, that's fair,

826
00:34:56,259 --> 00:34:56,779
you know.

827
00:34:57,138 --> 00:34:57,739
Um

828
00:34:58,139 --> 00:34:59,919
Yeah, because right now what'll happen, you know,

829
00:34:59,929 --> 00:35:02,719
is we'll go to the vendor and if they dispute it, then it becomes a huge problem,

830
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,939
right? It's a very heavy process,

831
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,719
right? And we, you know,

832
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:09,959
the reality is we're gonna be dealing with internet of things, vendors who really,

833
00:35:09,969 --> 00:35:12,389
really don't want CV S assigned to their products.

834
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,120
That's probably fair.

835
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,239
I could see that.

836
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:19,689
Um And, you know, again, one of my long term goals is to turn CV,

837
00:35:19,699 --> 00:35:22,409
the perception of a CV in a product from something negative

838
00:35:22,669 --> 00:35:26,110
to something positive and that will, you know, one thing we'll need is more data,

839
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:26,409
right?

840
00:35:26,419 --> 00:35:29,709
So when was this, you know, when did this CV come out? When did the vendor fix it?

841
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:31,800
Oh, wait, you know, the vendor found it and fixed it.

842
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:35,250
That's good. That means the vendor has a security process and is auditing code,

843
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,580
you know, so this is like a positive CV, you know, they're proactively fixing stuff,

844
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:43,040
you know, versus the vendors that have CV S that are still unfixed 10 years later,

845
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:48,659
you know, or maybe it's just a CV, that doesn't really matter and that's OK.

846
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:49,479
-- You
-- know,

847
00:35:49,489 --> 00:35:50,770
it's a theoretical attack or whatever,

848
00:35:51,979 --> 00:35:55,020
you know, like a lot of stuff say the lens kernel, like we just,

849
00:35:55,189 --> 00:35:56,969
we give out CV S like candy,

850
00:35:57,189 --> 00:35:59,830
we don't require people to prove that these things are

851
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,159
exploitable because some of them are really difficult to prove.

852
00:36:02,169 --> 00:36:03,659
Like you need special hardware, you need,

853
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,340
I've seen cases where you have to like build a kernel module

854
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,979
to make the kernel more exploitable to hit the race condition.

855
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:11,340
Yeah, I've, I've seen that as well.

856
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:16,080
But on the other side of things, you also have instances where in the kernel,

857
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:19,719
we would say this isn't a security issue because at the time it wasn't.

858
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:23,020
But now with technologies like user name spaces,

859
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:28,209
you've opened up certain code paths to non route users who are

860
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:29,639
pretending to be root.

861
00:36:29,649 --> 00:36:33,600
And historically, it was said, well, if you can't trust root, you're screwed.

862
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:34,520
So, who cares?

863
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:37,290
So, it's, these are some crazy issues

864
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,719
-- to think about
-- and that's part of what's also changing is, you know,

865
00:36:39,729 --> 00:36:41,709
what is a security issue?

866
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:45,909
Right? It used to be encryption is a great example. Right? Des used to be secure.

867
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,030
Des is no longer Secure Des 56 bit can be cracked

868
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,189
-- in real time
-- on a phone if you're using it,

869
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:55,340
-- like that's clearly a security issue,
-- you know, same thing with like MD five, right?

870
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:58,139
And I remember when 20 years ago MD five was totally fine.

871
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:00,790
And then some guy I forget who it was. I want to say

872
00:37:00,989 --> 00:37:02,989
an Italian research group with a bunch of,

873
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,479
what was it? Um PS twos or something

874
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:10,229
with the cell chips. And anyways, they, they made this like crazy board

875
00:37:10,389 --> 00:37:12,770
thing of like 100 or 200 PS twos

876
00:37:12,899 --> 00:37:14,800
and generated a valid

877
00:37:15,879 --> 00:37:18,020
MD five collision for a

878
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:22,159
SSL certificate. So it wasn't just like here's an MD five collision. Ok.

879
00:37:22,169 --> 00:37:26,280
That's cool. It was, here's an MD five collision for a valid SSL certificate,

880
00:37:26,929 --> 00:37:29,399
ok. We have to stop using MD five for these things.

881
00:37:29,689 --> 00:37:31,149
Um The same thing with Sha one now,

882
00:37:31,409 --> 00:37:32,629
-- one years
-- later we

883
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:33,159
did.

884
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:37,360
-- Yeah,
-- and sha one is now being slowly but surely phased out, you know, it's now

885
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:41,129
January, the browsers like Chrome and stuff and Firefox are,

886
00:37:41,139 --> 00:37:44,340
are no longer trusting Sha One certificates

887
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:45,239
um

888
00:37:46,129 --> 00:37:50,030
like the root certificates, the end certificate on the server can still be sha one.

889
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:54,310
Um, but, you know, as time goes on that's going to be phased down, I believe,

890
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,899
I think Google said, like 2019 or something is when they're just like, you,

891
00:37:57,909 --> 00:37:59,439
you better be off of sha one.

892
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:03,479
And that's fantastic because we actually have time to do this. Right.

893
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:07,780
-- Instead of it being lit on fire. Holy crap. Do it now.
-- Yeah, exactly.

894
00:38:08,229 --> 00:38:12,050
Um, and so for example, like right now if you're using DES in like any way,

895
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,239
shape or form in software,

896
00:38:13,409 --> 00:38:16,820
that's the seat like you, you're wrong. I'm sorry, but that's wrong.

897
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,340
You cannot use DES anymore.

898
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,100
Same thing with like three does, three does is just not strong enough.

899
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:25,709
Same thing with MD five for say password storage. It's just not strong enough

900
00:38:26,149 --> 00:38:26,350
with

901
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:26,629
Rainbow,

902
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:29,100
you can crack it in like minutes.

903
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,439
Now, the thing though that,

904
00:38:30,449 --> 00:38:33,149
that can get interesting and I'm going to pick on MD five

905
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:36,479
here because I've been dealing with some MD five things lately is

906
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:39,760
when you back up data into Amazon S3,

907
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:41,419
they use MD five as a check

908
00:38:41,649 --> 00:38:41,679
zone,

909
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,479
but it's not security related, right?

910
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,889
However, however, you know,

911
00:38:46,969 --> 00:38:50,050
there's some ridiculous standard out there somewhere that says,

912
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:53,360
like you must never use MD five under any circumstances.

913
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:56,810
-- And, and S3 probably is a problem for them because
-- a

914
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:00,639
good example. So like AC RC checks some say on data sent over a modem

915
00:39:01,649 --> 00:39:04,100
is not making a security claim.

916
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,260
It's, it's essentially making an effort to like,

917
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:10,899
-- make sure if your data gets mangled, it gets noticed easily and
-- it's fast.

918
00:39:10,909 --> 00:39:11,189
Right.

919
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:16,790
That's, that's the reason they're using like MD five is not because it's secure,

920
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,429
but because they can calculate it really freaking quickly.

921
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,389
And so, for example, that's,

922
00:39:21,399 --> 00:39:23,790
that's a good example where if MD five is

923
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,110
either being used in some sort of security claim,

924
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,070
like, oh, we, you know,

925
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:29,540
use MD five to secure your data from,

926
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:30,389
you know, like

927
00:39:30,709 --> 00:39:31,439
Excel certificates, right?

928
00:39:31,449 --> 00:39:33,979
To prevent them from being monkeyed with after they've been signed.

929
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:37,179
Uh That's a problem or if you're using MD five implicitly

930
00:39:37,189 --> 00:39:40,260
in some sort of security operation like say storing a password,

931
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:43,610
you know, you're essentially making the claim that this is secure from cracking,

932
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,030
right?

933
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:45,010
That's a problem.

934
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:50,000
But if you're using MD five as yeah, as a check sum for data, like on your say,

935
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:52,580
yeah, S3 buckets or whatever,

936
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,969
as long as you're not making a security claim that says like this will, you know,

937
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:58,239
make sure that the data is completely valid.

938
00:39:58,590 --> 00:39:59,270
That's OK.

939
00:39:59,280 --> 00:39:59,540
Now,

940
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:03,810
if you were using that MD five signature and then signing it cryptographically,

941
00:40:04,389 --> 00:40:06,909
now you're implicitly making a security claim saying

942
00:40:06,919 --> 00:40:08,310
that this MD five sum is really,

943
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,169
really like correct

944
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:12,270
can't be faked. So we're signing it.

945
00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:13,909
Now you have a problem

946
00:40:14,739 --> 00:40:16,729
and then like long term, essentially,

947
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:17,610
you know,

948
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,399
MD five will

949
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,320
generally, you use MD five,

950
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:23,459
you get a CV E unless it's like some

951
00:40:23,469 --> 00:40:26,820
specific case where it's definitely not a security issue.

952
00:40:26,919 --> 00:40:30,540
-- Do we, do you do that today for MD five?
-- Not yet.

953
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:35,219
Well, we, for example, for password storage, you win a CV, automatically

954
00:40:35,524 --> 00:40:38,625
because just with Rainbow tables, you can crack that stuff in like minutes.

955
00:40:38,725 --> 00:40:42,475
The rainbow MD five tables are only several, I think, tens of terabytes, which

956
00:40:42,945 --> 00:40:43,094
there's,

957
00:40:44,044 --> 00:40:45,625
I mean, there's a bunch of stuff

958
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:49,084
-- even
-- with the salt, you can still, like, you can rent time on Amazon.

959
00:40:49,094 --> 00:40:51,125
There's a guy doing real time. Um,

960
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:54,739
uh, it's the windows password cracking, you know, the network credentials

961
00:40:54,969 --> 00:40:58,389
and he's, you know, it's, I think it's like 50 bucks and he guarantees you,

962
00:40:58,399 --> 00:41:00,540
he'll spit out an answer in like less than half an

963
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:03,350
hour and he's just got a giant pile of rainbow tables

964
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,949
and then, you know, like

965
00:41:05,219 --> 00:41:08,199
they rent time on Amazon GP U systems and voila,

966
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:08,800
you know,

967
00:41:09,429 --> 00:41:12,199
like, yeah, you need 10,000 servers to crack this thing in half an hour.

968
00:41:12,209 --> 00:41:14,429
Well, you can do that now with Amazon,

969
00:41:15,129 --> 00:41:17,020
you know, like we discussed in the Santa episode.

970
00:41:17,479 --> 00:41:18,830
Right. Totally doable

971
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:20,629
and

972
00:41:20,929 --> 00:41:23,989
more to the point, not only doable, it's cost effective. That's,

973
00:41:24,139 --> 00:41:25,040
that's a big bugaboo,

974
00:41:26,169 --> 00:41:26,639
you know.

975
00:41:26,929 --> 00:41:27,419
That's true.

976
00:41:27,429 --> 00:41:30,070
I suppose if you have a password cracking service like that,

977
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,419
you just power down all the gear when you're not using it and then

978
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,889
when you need it just room away.

979
00:41:35,899 --> 00:41:39,159
-- We go
-- and you just, and you can also use the spot instance market.

980
00:41:39,169 --> 00:41:40,590
So you're not even paying the full rate.

981
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:41,860
That's true. You can get for

982
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:44,030
one server dies, just

983
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:45,419
start it with the data.

984
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:46,389
So

985
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:50,560
the, yeah, so the bar of what is and is not A CV is constantly moving and,

986
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:55,580
and one thing I do want to do long term is have us more carefully document it

987
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:56,540
because, you know,

988
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:59,229
obviously that'll make life easier and less subjective for everybody.

989
00:42:00,449 --> 00:42:03,489
Um But, you know, that's one of those things on the to do list for long term.

990
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,270
Um

991
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,580
But as these things change, you know, I'm, I'm guessing at some point, you know,

992
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,149
we might

993
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:10,530
quantum cryptography becomes a thing and like

994
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:13,030
we have to like literally declare every existing

995
00:42:13,669 --> 00:42:15,909
encryption algorithm like, yep, nope, don't do that,

996
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:17,889
man. That would be

997
00:42:18,129 --> 00:42:22,330
the greatest day ever. Can you imagine the work that's gonna be involved

998
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:23,209
and,

999
00:42:23,419 --> 00:42:25,570
well, but in all seriousness, I mean, this,

1000
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:29,270
it, it's all super related, which I think is really funny about that because we,

1001
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,899
we come back to thinking about managing your software then and

1002
00:42:32,229 --> 00:42:35,250
like, do you know if you have a product,

1003
00:42:35,629 --> 00:42:39,540
do you know what the encryption algorithms being used in your product are?

1004
00:42:40,189 --> 00:42:42,979
-- Well, and which ones are actually enabled?
-- Right. Exactly. It's

1005
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:43,580
rights

1006
00:42:43,879 --> 00:42:46,179
-- are they're using open SSL which supports
-- everything.

1007
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:47,899
It supports a million things. Exactly.

1008
00:42:47,909 --> 00:42:49,040
You know, and it has to right,

1009
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:51,939
because somebody has to interact with an old system somewhere doing MD five.

1010
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:56,320
So open SSL, the library must support all these old algorithms and,

1011
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:57,699
and that's going to have to continue.

1012
00:42:58,199 --> 00:43:00,489
But I mean, is your software actually using it or?

1013
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:01,219
Right.

1014
00:43:01,229 --> 00:43:05,469
It's, these are crazy problems and this is what people have to start thinking about.

1015
00:43:05,479 --> 00:43:08,739
It's not going to go away and if anything, it's going to get worse

1016
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:10,100
because

1017
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:11,100
you see that

1018
00:43:11,209 --> 00:43:16,260
email recently about, um, it's essentially a, an effort around

1019
00:43:16,399 --> 00:43:20,459
long term Linux kernel support. And when I say long term

1020
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:24,179
they're talking time frames of 50 to 100 years.

1021
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:28,060
Who is? No, I haven't seen that. I mean,

1022
00:43:28,229 --> 00:43:30,550
it was for industrial devices, drilling, like,

1023
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,179
think about it.

1024
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:33,949
There are people with sensor packages on the end

1025
00:43:33,959 --> 00:43:36,570
of drill bits that are like probably running Linux now

1026
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,780
everyone's running Linux

1027
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:38,370
open

1028
00:43:38,729 --> 00:43:39,219
source one,

1029
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:39,989
it is everywhere

1030
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:44,120
you have, like for example, a pump

1031
00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:48,360
running, you know, an oil pipeline, you're not going to be replaced.

1032
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:51,810
Like there are, I know, um, some of the water systems in the US,

1033
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:55,939
they have pumps and valves that are from the late 18 hundreds, unfortunately,

1034
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:56,750
you know,

1035
00:43:57,010 --> 00:44:00,830
and you know, like I remember what was it that really big?

1036
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:04,790
Uh, I think it was for Boston, they built that really huge new water pipe.

1037
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,199
It was like tens of miles of New York. Yeah, that's the one

1038
00:44:07,449 --> 00:44:10,320
because the old ones from like 1875.

1039
00:44:10,959 --> 00:44:12,260
Yeah, the original valves and they're, like,

1040
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:13,820
afraid to turn them more than a few degrees.

1041
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:14,879
So, because they're all rusty.

1042
00:44:14,889 --> 00:44:16,860
And anyways, yeah, the point being is you think that,

1043
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:20,699
that tunnels that they're building and the pumps that they're installing?

1044
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:24,979
I'm assuming they're planning to have those run and be there for 50 to 100 years.

1045
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:28,560
You know what I am sensitive to this topic.

1046
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:32,959
And in fact, I just had a call with a partner yesterday. It was

1047
00:44:33,389 --> 00:44:35,639
where we were discussing exactly this problem

1048
00:44:36,179 --> 00:44:36,820
and it

1049
00:44:37,139 --> 00:44:39,639
is, there isn't a good answer today.

1050
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:44,080
But I can tell you now that when you start thinking about technology and,

1051
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:46,110
and this was one of the things that came up is

1052
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:51,080
you can like, like we'll use a car as an example. So, in an automobile

1053
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:54,840
it is, I mean, there's 100 year old cars that still run. Right.

1054
00:44:55,419 --> 00:44:59,070
But technology specifically, electronics

1055
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:01,219
don't last for 100 years.

1056
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:02,199
Right.

1057
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:06,330
And so they, they don't, they just don't, like, that's the reality of it.

1058
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,709
If you have a pump with a computer attached to it,

1059
00:45:08,979 --> 00:45:11,780
you're going to have to have the board on the computer

1060
00:45:11,919 --> 00:45:13,889
be easily replaceable.

1061
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:18,530
And so what you don't need a kernel that can last 100 years,

1062
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:21,629
what you need is to build your stuff so

1063
00:45:21,639 --> 00:45:25,169
you can easily field to replace those electronics and

1064
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,320
potentially upgrade them in the process. Like that's the only real solution

1065
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:30,929
stuff is not really field replaceable, easily,

1066
00:45:30,939 --> 00:45:33,610
like undersea cables or undersea pipeline.

1067
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:37,540
It isn't today and it also doesn't have a computer on it in some instances.

1068
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:41,879
But if they want it to last for 50 years or 25 years or 100 years,

1069
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:46,540
you're going to have to make it field repairable because electronic components,

1070
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:48,939
especially the kind of stuff we're talking, that's like,

1071
00:45:48,949 --> 00:45:50,959
literally like lowest bidder wins.

1072
00:45:50,969 --> 00:45:52,939
Let's build it now, sort of stuff.

1073
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:57,120
It's just not gonna last 50 years. Right. That's the reality of it.

1074
00:45:57,245 --> 00:45:59,635
I mean, certainly at the price point that they're probably willing to pay.

1075
00:45:59,645 --> 00:46:02,764
I mean, these are not spacecraft where you really, you know, you,

1076
00:46:02,774 --> 00:46:04,405
you send it up and it's, well,

1077
00:46:04,415 --> 00:46:05,965
I think the Hubble spacecraft is really the

1078
00:46:05,975 --> 00:46:07,955
only thing we've ever fixed in outer space

1079
00:46:08,094 --> 00:46:12,304
-- and the ISS, of course.
-- But do you, if you've ever, I shouldn't say ever

1080
00:46:12,754 --> 00:46:16,104
look at the kind of gear they put into the space equipment,

1081
00:46:16,235 --> 00:46:20,945
it's not like off the shelf stuff they put in very specialized equipment. And

1082
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:24,504
that's the thing, right? Is, it's even a specialized equipment.

1083
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:29,139
It's, it has very understood life spans. And, yeah, a lot of it outlasted.

1084
00:46:29,149 --> 00:46:31,090
I mean, you gotta think like those Mars rovers were really

1085
00:46:31,979 --> 00:46:34,199
like, what a couple of months was their goal.

1086
00:46:34,209 --> 00:46:36,389
And now, I mean, it's like 10 years and they're, they're like,

1087
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:37,449
they're limping along.

1088
00:46:37,459 --> 00:46:38,050
Thank goodness.

1089
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:42,870
But, but even then, like, they're upgrading this gear in space, right?

1090
00:46:42,879 --> 00:46:45,209
They send updates to the software as it's.

1091
00:46:45,939 --> 00:46:50,300
But additionally, this stuff is operating in nonhostile environments

1092
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:55,330
because you, you don't have to worry about bad guys attacking your rover on Mars

1093
00:46:55,489 --> 00:46:56,050
now.

1094
00:46:56,239 --> 00:46:57,989
And this is something I think about actually is I've

1095
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,790
heard before that like the communications between the rover and,

1096
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:05,120
and NASA are like unauthenticated and unencrypted in every way.

1097
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:06,629
Now in their instance,

1098
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:10,590
you need probably a several million dollar satellite dish to communicate with,

1099
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,810
with the rover, which

1100
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,989
the barrier of entry is fairly high. But like you gotta think, man,

1101
00:47:17,229 --> 00:47:20,729
if it was possible for random people to connect to

1102
00:47:20,929 --> 00:47:23,610
and mess with that rover, they totally would

1103
00:47:24,229 --> 00:47:24,270
you

1104
00:47:24,489 --> 00:47:24,530
like

1105
00:47:25,969 --> 00:47:29,560
exactly. You'd have a giant picture of, of genitalia

1106
00:47:29,689 --> 00:47:30,959
on the service of Mars

1107
00:47:31,489 --> 00:47:31,939
for all

1108
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:32,350
time.

1109
00:47:32,899 --> 00:47:35,850
This leads to a because right now spacecraft are one of the few

1110
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:39,560
places where they people have traditionally always had to deal with really,

1111
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:41,469
really tight energy budgets, right?

1112
00:47:41,479 --> 00:47:43,199
We just don't have a lot of electricity

1113
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:44,689
to run the stuff, right?

1114
00:47:44,699 --> 00:47:46,620
Because something like the Voyager probe, you know,

1115
00:47:46,629 --> 00:47:49,669
it's so far away from the sun now, even with big solar panels,

1116
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:51,530
it's just not getting much light and power

1117
00:47:51,739 --> 00:47:52,290
uses plutonium.

1118
00:47:52,959 --> 00:47:54,280
-- It doesn't have solar panels.
-- Oh,

1119
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:56,929
-- that's right. Yeah. They use a plutonium nuclear
-- pile

1120
00:47:57,070 --> 00:48:00,239
and it's supposed to die here in a couple of years. They figure it won't have enough

1121
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,899
juice left to power anything.

1122
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,699
But, and that's going to become more of an issue for as we deploy

1123
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:08,260
electronics more and more remotely.

1124
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:13,320
I mean, solar panel is uh solar power is definitely one option, you know, but

1125
00:48:13,489 --> 00:48:16,760
for example, stuff that's in the ground or under water,

1126
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:17,820
you know,

1127
00:48:18,399 --> 00:48:21,459
how are we going to power that, you know, like batteries

1128
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:25,199
ignoring the power considerations. How do you take care of it?

1129
00:48:25,209 --> 00:48:27,040
How do you, I mean, let's face it, it's gonna run Linux,

1130
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:28,560
it's going to be full of open source.

1131
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:33,290
How are you gonna, what, what does it mean? How are you going to secure this stuff?

1132
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,330
How are you going to keep track of what you're running?

1133
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:37,360
Like these are crazy problems.

1134
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:38,060
Well,

1135
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:39,790
and what I was trying to get at was though is you

1136
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:43,199
have to make these tradeoffs between energy budget and say doing encryption,

1137
00:48:43,959 --> 00:48:47,139
-- right? Encryption will cost more electricity. Is it worth it?
-- Exactly.

1138
00:48:47,149 --> 00:48:48,620
That that's a really good point actually.

1139
00:48:48,629 --> 00:48:52,129
Is this kind of stuff needs to be taken into account? You're absolutely correct.

1140
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:53,570
So,

1141
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,219
yeah, I mean,

1142
00:48:55,229 --> 00:48:58,979
the good news is we're doing a lot more encryption on chip instead of in software.

1143
00:48:58,989 --> 00:48:59,719
So it's super,

1144
00:48:59,729 --> 00:49:03,590
super like uh what is it those intel chips with the Aes on board can do like

1145
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:05,629
10 or more gigabits per second of

1146
00:49:06,669 --> 00:49:09,199
now? AES is an easy protocol.

1147
00:49:09,209 --> 00:49:14,379
What happens when we have something doing, say RS A or a more complicated algorithm?

1148
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,419
And we find out that the silicone has a bug.

1149
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:19,750
Right.

1150
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:20,270
Yeah.

1151
00:49:20,439 --> 00:49:21,899
Well, you can, you can patch some of it.

1152
00:49:21,909 --> 00:49:24,090
I mean, in fact there's micro code and even,

1153
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:27,500
like the Linux kernel can work around certain CPU issues.

1154
00:49:27,629 --> 00:49:29,149
Do you remember the competition around A

1155
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:32,020
-- s though? Back in the day? About 1015 years ago?
-- Yeah.

1156
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:33,489
And they, they do, they're doing sha

1157
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:34,300
three. Well, I think

1158
00:49:34,469 --> 00:49:35,600
three, just one, didn't it?

1159
00:49:36,804 --> 00:49:41,314
I remember because there were five serious contenders finalists, uh, for a, as, uh,

1160
00:49:41,324 --> 00:49:42,044
there was rain.

1161
00:49:42,155 --> 00:49:46,104
All the Dutch one which is what was chosen as a s there was Mars from IBM,

1162
00:49:46,114 --> 00:49:49,135
which was essentially like a really upgraded uh des,

1163
00:49:49,604 --> 00:49:52,104
which was my actual personal favorite because it was

1164
00:49:52,314 --> 00:49:54,985
understandable and well known, you know. So,

1165
00:49:55,304 --> 00:49:56,104
um, but,

1166
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:59,245
you know, one of the reasons why they didn't go with Mars if memory serves,

1167
00:49:59,465 --> 00:50:00,225
I have no idea.

1168
00:50:00,645 --> 00:50:02,274
Took too many gates to implement in silicon.

1169
00:50:02,995 --> 00:50:04,784
That is a valid concern.

1170
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:06,040
Yeah, because they're like,

1171
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:09,590
this needs to go into ATM S and 10 years ago ATM S were not running like, you know,

1172
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,540
full P CS.

1173
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:12,679
They were actually running, you know, specialist,

1174
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:14,669
uh, chips and stuff 1015 years ago

1175
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:17,409
now. Of course. Yeah, they're just a windows PC on a board,

1176
00:50:17,669 --> 00:50:18,229
right?

1177
00:50:19,129 --> 00:50:20,379
Or whatever. But, you know,

1178
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:23,270
and so that was a vow thing like, uh smart cards, right?

1179
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,159
Smart cards need to do crypto and gate count is a real issue there and that still is.

1180
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:30,929
Yeah. And so Rain doll one because it was actually implement

1181
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:31,790
and not,

1182
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:33,790
it was actually surprisingly few gates.

1183
00:50:34,439 --> 00:50:37,330
Um I think it was in the tens of thousands. Uh We'll have to check that.

1184
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:41,110
It's probably on Wikipedia somewhere. But so the, the reality is like NIST,

1185
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:44,699
the, that's the National Institute of Standards and Technology is, uh you know,

1186
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:44,939
the,

1187
00:50:44,949 --> 00:50:49,300
the people handling these competitions and essentially picking the finalist,

1188
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:49,919
the winner.

1189
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:50,330
You know,

1190
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:51,989
they're smart enough to understand these prompts because

1191
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,899
they've been dealing with it for 2030 years.

1192
00:50:54,949 --> 00:50:57,530
So the good news is we have some really competent people doing it

1193
00:50:58,010 --> 00:50:58,280
and they

1194
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,580
got the group that's working on

1195
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:02,909
TLS 13 as well, aren't they?

1196
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:04,989
Which, uh, you know,

1197
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:08,129
it's gonna have perfect forward secrecy by default. So,

1198
00:51:08,449 --> 00:51:10,280
yeah, it'll be pretty good.

1199
00:51:10,389 --> 00:51:12,149
It's got a lot going for it.

1200
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:17,219
The, the challenge with that actually is going to be when TLS 13 comes out. It is.

1201
00:51:17,719 --> 00:51:20,100
I bet everyone's going to want to turn off one too

1202
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:24,239
-- and it takes time to get this stuff deployed.
-- Well, yes and no, it used to.

1203
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:28,429
But now you can outsource that to say somebody like cloud flare or Amazon, you know,

1204
00:51:28,439 --> 00:51:30,080
like their elastic load balancers.

1205
00:51:30,229 --> 00:51:32,639
And chances are you want to outsource some of this

1206
00:51:32,649 --> 00:51:34,810
stuff because do you want to do certificate management?

1207
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:37,530
Not necessarily, do you want to

1208
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:41,350
be responsible for properly configuring a TLS end point

1209
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,679
that's public facing or more to the point.

1210
00:51:43,689 --> 00:51:46,179
-- Remember we were talking about denial of service attacks. Right.
-- Yeah.

1211
00:51:46,189 --> 00:51:49,030
Yeah, that, that's a good point actually. That's, that's very fair.

1212
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,699
And this is one of the things I've been thinking about and

1213
00:51:51,709 --> 00:51:55,370
I'm hesitant to make any claims one way or the other,

1214
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:58,840
but the world is a different place today

1215
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:00,919
and when TLS 13 comes out,

1216
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:02,040
I am

1217
00:52:02,229 --> 00:52:06,600
expecting its uptake to be very different from

1218
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:08,590
the TLS versions that have come before it

1219
00:52:09,169 --> 00:52:13,979
and, and I, I think it'll be faster, but don't, don't quote me on that one.

1220
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:19,570
Well, for example, Clown Flare uh already does TLS 1.3.

1221
00:52:19,739 --> 00:52:20,639
Well, good for them,

1222
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:22,290
you know, so like,

1223
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:26,129
um I think they're already doing it. I think you have to be on a business account.

1224
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:26,929
I forget.

1225
00:52:26,939 --> 00:52:28,260
Uh but anyways point being, you know,

1226
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,110
if somebody like cloud flare turns it on for

1227
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:33,070
everybody that's like 30% of the internet traffic apparently,

1228
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:37,129
or Netflix or Amazon web services deploy or imagine

1229
00:52:37,139 --> 00:52:40,120
if like Google Amazon and Microsoft and say the next

1230
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:43,179
10 big cloud providers all deploy TLS version

1231
00:52:43,189 --> 00:52:45,280
-- 1.3 on all their stuff that's public
-- facing.

1232
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:46,270
And that would be

1233
00:52:46,399 --> 00:52:48,570
like 90% of the internet

1234
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:50,179
immediately. Exactly.

1235
00:52:50,399 --> 00:52:54,379
Which, which is cool and that's the way it should be. I think it is,

1236
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:56,189
this is the world we live in

1237
00:52:56,379 --> 00:53:01,649
and this is the world open source built is things are fast now, they're so fast.

1238
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:07,010
Also, there's an advantage to TLS, 1.3 is it is faster for connections than TLS 1.2.

1239
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:07,610
That's true. There's,

1240
00:53:08,409 --> 00:53:09,270
yep. Yep,

1241
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,580
which is awesome.

1242
00:53:10,689 --> 00:53:11,169
Of course,

1243
00:53:11,179 --> 00:53:15,070
until researchers find some terrible problem with that and the

1244
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:18,489
solution will be to add the extra round trip,

1245
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:24,080
but especially on like mobile, you know, removing a round trip from a connection.

1246
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:26,659
I mean, that's a significant thing in mobile, you know,

1247
00:53:26,669 --> 00:53:29,919
for battery consumption for latency, for everything, you know,

1248
00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:31,679
that actually makes a real difference.

1249
00:53:32,729 --> 00:53:36,000
And so I suspect because of that, that as well will, you know,

1250
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:41,169
to put it bluntly TLS 1.3 is better, it's faster, it's stronger, it's smarter,

1251
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:41,709
you know,

1252
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:43,350
it's like that's how we're, you know,

1253
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:47,870
that's why HTTP S adoption finally got really driven forward is Google was like,

1254
00:53:47,879 --> 00:53:52,270
-- well, if you do http S you get better search rankings, that's it,
-- which is awesome.

1255
00:53:52,649 --> 00:53:53,110
Yeah,

1256
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:54,270
you know, so

1257
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,510
people have a huge economic incentive to adopt http

1258
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,830
S now like to improve their search engine rankings,

1259
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:01,899
which is awesome.

1260
00:54:01,909 --> 00:54:05,530
Actually, there was somebody had a tweet the other day that was like security.

1261
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:08,080
People use TLS because it's better business. Uh and

1262
00:54:08,429 --> 00:54:10,330
then Google says use TLS because it'll get

1263
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:12,050
you better search rankings and business goes,

1264
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:13,810
we must have TLS now

1265
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:16,949
which, but at the same time, like so I get this and this is,

1266
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:21,290
this is one of the other things that, that comes up a lot in fact,

1267
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,760
I'm gonna do a Birds of a feather of this at RS

1268
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:27,459
A is a fact that how do we justify spending money on security

1269
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:28,550
because

1270
00:54:28,729 --> 00:54:32,139
we kind of suck at it. And that's a topic for another day. I'm not gonna get into it now.

1271
00:54:32,149 --> 00:54:32,949
But obviously,

1272
00:54:33,149 --> 00:54:36,610
as security people, we struggle to show why this matters.

1273
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:38,570
But obviously, when Google says,

1274
00:54:39,239 --> 00:54:42,260
right, when Google says, if you turn this on something good happen to you, now,

1275
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:44,899
all of a sudden there's like actual reasons to do it

1276
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:45,469
and

1277
00:54:45,909 --> 00:54:48,929
we'll have to talk about the economics of security at some point,

1278
00:54:48,989 --> 00:54:51,199
which I guess we kind of Sprinkle in here and there.

1279
00:54:51,209 --> 00:54:51,469
But

1280
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:52,399
it's been,

1281
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:55,530
yeah, we've, we've drugged this on long enough. I think it.

1282
00:54:55,850 --> 00:54:59,229
So if folks, if you're gonna be at RS A by all means,

1283
00:54:59,239 --> 00:55:03,179
let us know we'd love to have a drink or say hi or, or hang out or whatnot.

1284
00:55:03,669 --> 00:55:05,689
And obviously, you know how to reach us on Twitter.

1285
00:55:05,699 --> 00:55:10,219
You can go to open source security podcast.com and we've got links to,

1286
00:55:10,229 --> 00:55:12,169
we'll put links to our RS A sessions there.

1287
00:55:12,179 --> 00:55:14,010
I know there's really not a lot of show notes for this week,

1288
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:16,350
but we've got uh links to Twitter as well.

1289
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:21,560
The, the Pound Os S podcast hashtag can be used to get a hold of us.

1290
00:55:22,209 --> 00:55:22,699
Uh

1291
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,419
Yeah, I don't, I don't have a lot else to say, I guess. Just,

1292
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:29,929
yeah, let's look forward to Rs A. It should be exciting and fun as it always is.

1293
00:55:29,939 --> 00:55:30,860
And Kurt,

1294
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:33,629
if nothing else, you have a fantastic day.

1295
00:55:34,610 --> 00:55:35,239
You too.

1296
00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:38,629
All right, folks. Until next time. Thank you and take care.
