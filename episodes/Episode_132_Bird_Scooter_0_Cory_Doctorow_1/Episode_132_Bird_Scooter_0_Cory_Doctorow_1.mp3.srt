Hello and welcome to the open source Security podcast episode 132

1
00:00:09,569 --> 00:00:12,109
with myself Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime,

2
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:12,989
Josh Pressers.

3
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:14,109
-- So,
-- what's new? Kurt?

4
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:17,270
-- I cleaned my desk.
-- Wow, that's fun.

5
00:00:17,299 --> 00:00:17,790
It's nice.

6
00:00:17,799 --> 00:00:19,540
I actually have some space now. It's not covered in,

7
00:00:19,809 --> 00:00:21,475
well, whatever it was covered in before.

8
00:00:21,885 --> 00:00:23,825
Very important things, I'm sure.

9
00:00:23,885 --> 00:00:26,985
So, actually I moved my office over the Christmas break.

10
00:00:26,995 --> 00:00:29,014
It was, it was a little before actually. And

11
00:00:29,274 --> 00:00:34,034
when I moved, I basically just threw everything away and said, I'm not even like,

12
00:00:34,044 --> 00:00:35,424
if I need this,

13
00:00:35,715 --> 00:00:38,505
I will buy a new one was basically my stance.

14
00:00:38,514 --> 00:00:41,014
And of course I've not bought any new things and I don't expect

15
00:00:41,025 --> 00:00:43,584
to either just because when you've been in one place and like,

16
00:00:43,595 --> 00:00:47,735
this is true of just having a desk in general, you amass things and it's always, oh,

17
00:00:47,744 --> 00:00:49,904
I need to keep this because I might need it someday.

18
00:00:50,099 --> 00:00:52,479
And the reality is you probably won't.

19
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,560
And even if you do,

20
00:00:54,819 --> 00:00:59,060
you can probably buy one for less money than it's actually costing you

21
00:00:59,069 --> 00:01:02,340
in terms of just like mental sanity to keep it on your desk.

22
00:01:02,349 --> 00:01:02,720
Right.

23
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,580
So, one thing I've done is I got rid of drawers.

24
00:01:06,089 --> 00:01:09,040
I, I'm not allowed to have drawers in my office except for my filing cabinet.

25
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,720
Yeah, I know that feeling too.

26
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,680
I had a huge desk with a ton of storage in it and my new

27
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:17,540
desk has one little tiny drawer on the front of it that I keep,

28
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,120
like my wallet and pencils in

29
00:01:19,669 --> 00:01:20,290
and

30
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:23,489
all the other garbage I literally threw away and, and in fact,

31
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,769
I was cleaning up the jars and it was like, what is like, where did this even come from?

32
00:01:27,779 --> 00:01:31,330
You know, it was, it was crazy. I had no idea what half of it even was.

33
00:01:31,339 --> 00:01:35,580
-- It's,
-- it's always amazing to me how fundamentally the same human behaviors are.

34
00:01:35,589 --> 00:01:37,169
Right. We've never, well, like

35
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:38,779
we're, we're from different countries.

36
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,430
We've gone through different education systems.

37
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,089
But like you give us both a desk and with drawers and

38
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:45,480
it'll look identical after six months.

39
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:46,110
Yeah.

40
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,099
But I have a suspicion that's kind of just

41
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,580
like the evolution of the human species where,

42
00:01:50,589 --> 00:01:52,080
you know, historically speaking,

43
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:57,529
the only things you would amass were food or maybe some sort of crude tools

44
00:01:57,739 --> 00:01:59,540
and, and generally speaking,

45
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,279
you needed to keep those because like, if you didn't, you would die,

46
00:02:03,449 --> 00:02:03,879
right?

47
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:07,000
Whereas now we've reached a point where we love to hoard

48
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,000
and keep things and we have all our shiny treasures.

49
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:11,740
But the reality is none of us are going to die

50
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:13,860
if the crap in our desk is thrown away.

51
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:14,300
Right.

52
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,229
Yeah. Well, speaking of thrown away. So these bird scooters,

53
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,429
those things, I, it's fascinating to me because it's

54
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:24,410
so, I don't even care about the technology piece so much. It's just

55
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,699
one of the things that's fascinating to me is so

56
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,350
back in the olden days and by olden days,

57
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,360
I mean, like 10 years ago,

58
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:32,520
the days of yore. Well, they are, the olden days.

59
00:02:32,529 --> 00:02:34,550
It was a fundamentally different world. We didn't have,

60
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:37,059
let's say, 13 years ago, we didn't have smartphones,

61
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,369
we didn't have, you know, you couldn't put a computer into a device for $5.

62
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,800
But anyways. Right. Right.

63
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,039
So what would happen,

64
00:02:45,149 --> 00:02:49,100
say, 13 years ago if you left a $300 piece of electronics on the street?

65
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,559
Yik, like,

66
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,149
yeah.

67
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:55,679
Right. There's no way to, to do DRM on it. That was reliable enough.

68
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,199
There's no way to put, like a cell phone and GPS tracking system in there.

69
00:03:00,169 --> 00:03:04,389
So, yeah, if you left like a $300 thing on the street, somebody would, um,

70
00:03:04,529 --> 00:03:05,229
take it,

71
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:06,339
you know,

72
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,960
they might try and return it to you if it had a phone number or something on it.

73
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,699
But fundamentally it would probably get stolen.

74
00:03:11,529 --> 00:03:14,100
-- And it's fascinating
-- to me that end up in the river when they were.

75
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:14,970
Exactly. Yeah.

76
00:03:15,149 --> 00:03:18,020
Um, well, and, and even in Holland when the, when they did the, the,

77
00:03:18,029 --> 00:03:20,539
the free bike share thing back in the day.

78
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,860
They just, you know, Miss Koreans, chuck them in the river

79
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,259
or in the canals. Sorry.

80
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,429
So, actually speaking of that, I'm going to interrupt you for a moment.

81
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,070
I was in Amsterdam. It maybe a year or two ago. I forget it. It's been a little while.

82
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:36,500
But anyway, uh, I saw a bike in the canal and I asked one of my friends, I said, you know,

83
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:37,350
what's the deal?

84
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,710
I, you know, there's some bikes in the canal. Why don't they, like, take them out?

85
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,710
They're like, oh, yeah, they fish them out every couple, every couple times a year

86
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,940
and then they, I guess, take them, fix them up and resell them.

87
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,559
It, it's, but apparently there's like,

88
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:52,190
there's so many bicycles in the city they have serious problems with, like,

89
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:55,179
tourists will throw them in the water or people will just get sick of their

90
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,960
bicycles and the way they deal with them is they throw them in the canal.

91
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,639
Like, it, it's easier than trying to throw it out or, or whatever.

92
00:04:01,649 --> 00:04:01,880
Well,

93
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:03,839
I guess it's better than just leaving them on the

94
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,759
-- street because there's already
-- a lot on the street.

95
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,399
Well, like every time there's a garbage strike, right, you end up with like,

96
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,419
piles of trash on the street and like,

97
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,789
you know, even three or four bicycles on a street would create a serious hazard.

98
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,630
Like, it would, they

99
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:16,839
show a

100
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,040
lot of room when they're on their side.

101
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:21,079
They do and there's lots of bicycles in Amsterdam anyway.

102
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:23,630
-- I'm sorry, we were talking about bird scooters. So,
-- yeah.

103
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,140
So, so for example, I mean, back in, you know, nowadays the bird scooters,

104
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:29,160
what they have like ad RM on the board so that you

105
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,059
can only unlock it with your smartphone in the app and blah,

106
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,589
blah, blah.

107
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:32,279
Right.

108
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,109
As I understand it, they, they have GPS and something to report back so that those,

109
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:38,059
there's people that, like,

110
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,109
it's like collecting cans except they collect bird scooters and then plug them in,

111
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:43,250
which I was kind of wondering how that works. Right.

112
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,880
Because, you know, bird scooters run on batteries, batteries need to be recharged.

113
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:47,720
You know, we,

114
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:52,119
we had a show about this a couple of months ago actually because there's like a crazy,

115
00:04:52,269 --> 00:04:55,640
I guess internal fighting something where with all these

116
00:04:55,649 --> 00:04:58,160
people trying to collect from scooters and charge them,

117
00:04:58,595 --> 00:04:59,904
guess what's happened is, you know, these,

118
00:04:59,915 --> 00:05:04,184
these bird scooters go from being legally owned by bird to,

119
00:05:04,225 --> 00:05:12,454
I guess being abandoned property and seized by the city or some other lawful means,

120
00:05:12,464 --> 00:05:13,704
some entity is seizing them.

121
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,535
Right. Like you and I, I don't think

122
00:05:16,109 --> 00:05:19,410
can just legally pick them up off the street even if they're abandoned.

123
00:05:19,739 --> 00:05:22,380
And I was kind of looking, trying to look into this to find out like,

124
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,790
what is the general

125
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,769
sort of western law on

126
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:27,809
if I abandon?

127
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:31,670
Well, see the problem is number one. It's not my property, it's Bird's property.

128
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:32,040
And I'm

129
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:35,420
technically, I'm abandoning it because I don't intend to come back and use it.

130
00:05:35,429 --> 00:05:39,869
-- Right. I'm done with it. So
-- I, I actually do know how this works due to a mishap.

131
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,230
A friend had a long time ago with a vehicle.

132
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,359
So what actually happens is like, let's say you park your car somewhere,

133
00:05:45,369 --> 00:05:47,559
you're not supposed to and it gets towed.

134
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:48,109
right?

135
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,350
And it goes to like the impound lot

136
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:53,559
and the impound lot isn't just cars like they have every crazy

137
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,679
thing you can imagine at an impound lot because people forget or,

138
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,600
or misplace things in crazy ways

139
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,880
and then the, the police,

140
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,720
they, they make a best effort to contact you and basically say we, we towed your crap,

141
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,989
come get it right.

142
00:06:07,429 --> 00:06:09,730
And then after a certain amount they have to contact you a

143
00:06:09,739 --> 00:06:11,799
certain number of times I forget all the gory details there.

144
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:15,739
But basically what happens then is after making an effort to contact you,

145
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,859
if you don't come and get it

146
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:19,839
like they, they sell it, they auction it off.

147
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,260
Well,

148
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:23,950
there's a second issue there is that the impound fees

149
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:26,549
typically charge or the impound lots typically charge fees.

150
00:06:27,989 --> 00:06:29,459
And so at some point,

151
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,209
uh, retrieving that

152
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,059
thing,

153
00:06:32,299 --> 00:06:36,230
it becomes economically unjustifiable, right? If I own a $2000 car

154
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:41,769
and I own, you know, 1000 or $2000 on impound fees, well, then you know,

155
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:43,100
I might as well just go buy a new car

156
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,339
or whatever.

157
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,380
Um, and that's the thing with these $300 scooters, as I understand it, you know,

158
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,269
the impound fees add up quite quickly

159
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:53,089
and don't really make it justifiable to go and retrieve these.

160
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:56,339
The other thing I was wondering, for example, if I leave my wallet on the street,

161
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,579
they don't

162
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,089
auction it off.

163
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,730
So there's certain types of property where if they're abandoned

164
00:07:01,739 --> 00:07:04,769
in public they don't get seized and auctioned off.

165
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:09,679
I don't know about wallets, but I would bet you anything that it totally would,

166
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,279
where they,

167
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,070
they would put it in a box and then they would

168
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:15,239
auction off like a box of wallets or something like that.

169
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,200
And granted it's totally empty.

170
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:21,320
Well, the, you, you, they can't legally sell your driver's license.

171
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:24,730
Well, I'm sure they would take out things like a driver's license. Right.

172
00:07:24,739 --> 00:07:28,279
But, I mean, in all seriousness, like they, they impound and they find,

173
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,200
like if you bring a wallet to the police

174
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:32,600
station and there's literally no identification in it,

175
00:07:32,929 --> 00:07:35,070
they're either going to keep it and dump it off like

176
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,709
we just talked about or they're going to throw it away.

177
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,109
Right. Because what, what else do you do with it?

178
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:39,910
There's, they're not going to keep it forever.

179
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:40,630
Yeah.

180
00:07:40,989 --> 00:07:41,859
But anyway, so

181
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,920
the deal is apparently, is that

182
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:46,540
bird scooters have DRM and whatever to protect them.

183
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:47,920
So you can only use them with the app, but

184
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,660
there's a simple way to deal with this, which is you,

185
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:54,070
you take the motherboard that's in there, you, you remove it,

186
00:07:54,299 --> 00:07:57,709
throw it away and you put a new one in that doesn't have DRM and bam,

187
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,079
you got a $300 scooter for the cost of this motherboard kit.

188
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,869
It's not

189
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,929
the D MC A bypass because you're,

190
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,570
you're throw like you're literally throwing all of the copyright protection out.

191
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:09,690
Like you're, you're not touching it, you're not looking at it,

192
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:12,779
you're literally putting it in the trash bin, right? And by,

193
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:13,359
you know,

194
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:17,899
tried to go after Cory Doctorow for copyright infringement and DNA violation and

195
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,989
-- quote, un quote and said he
-- picked the wrong,

196
00:08:20,109 --> 00:08:20,190
the

197
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:20,700
wrong.

198
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,200
Well,

199
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:25,829
yeah, no kidding. Like, have you ever read any of his books?

200
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:26,589
You know?

201
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,459
Right.

202
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:28,549
So,

203
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,790
but I was wondering, for example, if the motors had,

204
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,630
for the sake of argument had a chip with built in D MC A?

205
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,760
Well, then you would have to maybe bypass that to make the motor work or for example,

206
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,070
what if the motors had

207
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:43,150
a custom patented plug design

208
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,520
and you couldn't, you know, buy that plug apart from through bird. Well,

209
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:52,250
you know, and I feel like that might be the next step of birds evolution.

210
00:08:52,419 --> 00:08:54,940
All these scooters come from one or two manufacturers in China,

211
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:57,190
you know, they, it's not like birds

212
00:08:57,549 --> 00:08:58,960
designed and made these things.

213
00:08:58,969 --> 00:08:59,309
They, you know,

214
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,489
essentially partnered with a Chinese manufacturer who

215
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,719
did most of the heavy lifting.

216
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,979
But what really we, and you and I were talking about this is, you know, the,

217
00:09:05,989 --> 00:09:08,669
the law to deal with this need to catch up because so

218
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:12,619
we have generally we have laws to cover cars and pretty much every

219
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:14,960
case a car can be in, in a city,

220
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,000
you know, if it's broken, it gets towed.

221
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,280
If it's abandoned, it gets towed,

222
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:22,080
if it's parked too long and there's too many parking tickets on it, it gets towed,

223
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,000
you know.

224
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,619
Uh, no, you can't take that car just because somebody said I'm going to leave it here.

225
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:26,929
You know,

226
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:29,460
people who illegally park their cars and leave the keys in it.

227
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:32,140
I, I can't get in their car and drive it away. That's

228
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:32,900
theft.

229
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,169
You know, even though it's really

230
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,260
sometimes, like, for example, at the ski hill,

231
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,679
they have like a small loading zone that fits five or six cars and

232
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,429
people will just park their cars there. Right.

233
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,929
And it just annoys me immensely because it's covered

234
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,159
in no parking signs and no stopping signs,

235
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:47,789
you know, and it's,

236
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:49,359
yeah, anyways,

237
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,700
obviously these laws need to catch up a bit. And part of me was wondering,

238
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,919
you know, how much, what's the responsibility of the company here? Right.

239
00:09:57,929 --> 00:10:01,489
Should they have dedicated people to go get these things out of impound quickly?

240
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:07,700
Should there be a city bylaws saying, for example, if an electric scooter is left

241
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,830
on a sidewalk outside of a designated scooter leaving zone.

242
00:10:12,989 --> 00:10:17,099
You know, if it's there for 12 hours or 24 hours it gets towed and by towed, I mean,

243
00:10:17,109 --> 00:10:19,510
somebody throws it in the back of a pickup truck because for example,

244
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,580
locally there's a, a company that collects all the shopping carts.

245
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,309
Right? Because people take shopping carts

246
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,429
and

247
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:30,460
use them to, you know, for can collection or, or they, to put it, sadly,

248
00:10:30,469 --> 00:10:31,419
they live out of them.

249
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,010
Um, but so there'll be, you know,

250
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,369
or people will take the shopping cart to the bus stop and

251
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,190
leave it there and then take their shopping on the bus.

252
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:40,099
And so I used to live in a not so great neighborhood

253
00:10:40,109 --> 00:10:42,450
and there was a couple of abandoned shopping carts in the alley

254
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:44,280
and it was getting to the point of actually like

255
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:46,469
driving your car past there was getting a troublesome.

256
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,270
So I phoned, you know, the city 311

257
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:51,520
and they're like, oh, yeah, you know what, like who owns these cars?

258
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,700
Like what, what are the handles saying?

259
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,700
And I'm like, oh, there's like a safeway and like a,

260
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,520
like a superstore. And I think like the, there's like a Lowe's or something.

261
00:10:58,609 --> 00:11:02,080
They're like, ok, what's the address? Tap, tap, tap. Ok. The guy will come back.

262
00:11:02,739 --> 00:11:03,880
And so it was interesting is,

263
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,549
is they came up by and they picked out three of

264
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:08,219
the four shopping carts and they left one that was,

265
00:11:08,229 --> 00:11:10,869
like, really beat up and I didn't know who owned it.

266
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,710
So I actually ended up cutting it up with

267
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:14,659
a Sawzall and taking it into the recycle stage

268
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:19,039
because, like, well, what else? Like the city won't take it and it's

269
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:22,619
sitting in my back alley, like, I don't really want it there.

270
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,200
So I, I cut it, you know, and, and II, I feel like I had made a good effort.

271
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,590
So I cut it up with the

272
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,960
-- sozo.
-- You probably committed some sort of crime

273
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,210
-- and,
-- and it went in for recycling. So,

274
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:34,739
and, well, can I do that with the bird scooter?

275
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,739
I have a suspicion that if by leaves a

276
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,340
scooter on the street in a place that doesn't belong

277
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,330
as, as private citizens,

278
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:47,010
it's almost certainly illegal for us to just take those things.

279
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,280
Right. Because like if I park my bike on the street

280
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,000
and I don't lock it up,

281
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:53,859
it is not legal for people to take it.

282
00:11:53,989 --> 00:11:58,780
-- But for example, I can move it if it's in my way
-- and, and I'm ok with moving things,

283
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:00,159
but I also lock my bike up.

284
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:02,530
-- Well,
-- but how far can I move it? A foot? 20 ft,

285
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,659
-- 100
-- feet.

286
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:07,700
There is almost certainly a level of reasonableness to that

287
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:11,219
where moving it to my house is probably illegal.

288
00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:15,820
Moving it to the next bike rack to make room for something is probably fine

289
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,179
right now,

290
00:12:17,609 --> 00:12:19,950
when the police impound a bird scooter.

291
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,080
Obviously there's legal frameworks around impounding things and,

292
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,799
and this is where I think,

293
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,880
uh, I'm gonna pick on you specifically.

294
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:31,559
I think you've, you've fallen into the old security mindset of perfect or nothing.

295
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:36,489
My guess is by, knows what it costs them to go get a scooter.

296
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:39,489
And I bet it costs more to go get it than it's worth

297
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:42,090
because you figure they might pay $300 for it.

298
00:12:42,099 --> 00:12:44,929
But as soon as they drop it on the street, it starts to depreciate.

299
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:48,409
And so, I mean, once that scooter has been in use for, let's say a year,

300
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:50,950
it's probably only worth $200 or less.

301
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,590
And my guess is paying someone to go to the impound lot.

302
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:55,929
Pay the fine.

303
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,150
You know what I mean?

304
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:02,190
I bet you're, you're probably very close to $300 per scooter at that point.

305
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,469
See, but then the problem is, for example, there's a $5 fee on recycling tires here

306
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,390
and I, I assume most of the world as well.

307
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,440
So can I just start leaving my old tires and appliances on the street?

308
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,510
-- Uh
-- No, because you own them

309
00:13:15,619 --> 00:13:17,719
and dumping them on the street is littering,

310
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,919
right? And so

311
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,859
how is the bird scooter different?

312
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,909
I would argue it's not littering because it's a device

313
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:26,539
that's meant to be used and do a thing.

314
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:27,369
And now

315
00:13:27,469 --> 00:13:29,590
I would also say that if, for example,

316
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:32,960
let's say you had a bunch of broken bird scooters on a street corner.

317
00:13:33,219 --> 00:13:36,119
You could totally go after bird for littering

318
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,700
and, and I guess most importantly,

319
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,140
it's just the fact that a lot of the

320
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,729
city laws and state laws and federal laws and whatever

321
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:46,059
they're, they're not caught up to all this yet.

322
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,989
And I, they will, I mean,

323
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,859
I have no doubt they will because you look at all

324
00:13:49,869 --> 00:13:53,940
these cities that are either annoyed or welcoming the bird scooters because

325
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,210
I think it's one of those things,

326
00:13:55,219 --> 00:13:57,460
it seems like a great idea to you get them and then it's like,

327
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:58,809
oh these freaking things,

328
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:02,570
it's like before we hit record, we were joking where I was saying,

329
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,299
I love bird scooters when I'm using the bird scooter.

330
00:14:05,349 --> 00:14:05,979
But like

331
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,200
if anyone else has one, I hate them.

332
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,419
It's kind of like actually drones are the same deal.

333
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:13,380
So I got this little like crappy drone for Christmas and it's super fun to

334
00:14:13,489 --> 00:14:13,929
fly

335
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,429
when I'm flying the drone. It's awesome

336
00:14:16,549 --> 00:14:18,059
when someone else is flying a drone.

337
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,039
I'm like, oh, that thing is so noisy and annoying.

338
00:14:20,049 --> 00:14:22,909
Like, can't you do that somewhere else? And it's like

339
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,440
everything is like that, right? It's like when I do it, it's fine.

340
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,190
But if someone else does it, man, that's annoying and I hate it.

341
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,750
-- No,
-- I, I suspect you're right. The laws will have to catch up.

342
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:38,109
But I think we also need some better frameworks for behavior because

343
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,330
you know,

344
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,940
for example, where is an appropriate place to leave a scooter?

345
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,299
Like I know with bicycles in, in a lot of Europe,

346
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:49,030
they'll have signs, you know, because they have those lovely old metal fences

347
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:50,460
and they'll have signs on them saying, you know,

348
00:14:50,469 --> 00:14:52,859
don't lock your bike to this because like every

349
00:14:52,869 --> 00:14:55,179
night at midnight we'll come through with bolt cutters and

350
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:58,080
cut all the locks and throw all the bikes in the back of a truck.

351
00:14:58,239 --> 00:14:58,500
You know,

352
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,789
because we don't want the courthouse being surrounded in crappy bicycles.

353
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:02,559
You know, locally.

354
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:03,450
For example, there,

355
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:07,299
there has been a bit of an effort to put bike racks in at some of the newer, you know,

356
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:08,119
developments.

357
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,150
Although it's quite comical how

358
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,539
terrible some of these bike racks are or where they're located, they're like,

359
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:15,119
literally have a shopping complex and then like,

360
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,530
half a kilometer away is the bike rack, like

361
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,390
somewhere just completely random and looking at the bird scooters,

362
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,650
I'm not sure you can even lock them to most things,

363
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,900
-- you know, because there's, you don't
-- have to lock them.

364
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:27,229
They're, they're self locking

365
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,559
and, and look, I love having rules about where you can and can't put things.

366
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,760
And if I lock my bike up somewhere I'm not supposed

367
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,799
to and they cut my lock and haul it away,

368
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,429
that's my fault. That's my problem. Right.

369
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,479
And I think it's totally true with bird scooters

370
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,750
and it's totally up to the bird people to solve that problem if

371
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,289
they have people just dumping scooters in the middle of the street,

372
00:15:47,539 --> 00:15:48,570
like they can,

373
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,799
they're using technology to kind of make things work the way it does

374
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,130
and use your technology to make people park them when they're supposed to.

375
00:15:56,299 --> 00:15:56,650
Right.

376
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:56,849
Well,

377
00:15:56,859 --> 00:15:58,049
part of the challenge I think is back to our

378
00:15:58,059 --> 00:16:00,919
desk thing is people don't actually own these bird scooters.

379
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:02,250
Right. They're just using them. And,

380
00:16:02,604 --> 00:16:05,184
I mean, you've been in rental cars that are pretty nasty, I assume.

381
00:16:05,275 --> 00:16:09,265
-- Uh
-- no, I don't take them. I will go back to the counter and say that car sucks.

382
00:16:09,275 --> 00:16:12,565
It stinks, it's dirty, the seats ripped and I'll say I don't want this,

383
00:16:12,575 --> 00:16:14,625
like give me a different car and they always do.

384
00:16:14,635 --> 00:16:17,364
I've never once had them say like, no, you have to take it.

385
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,484
And, well, that's kind of my point is, you know, when,

386
00:16:19,594 --> 00:16:23,385
when people don't own something, they tend not to be very careful or take care of it.

387
00:16:23,854 --> 00:16:26,065
And that is something I think will be a real challenge

388
00:16:26,075 --> 00:16:30,335
with this sort of gig economy slash rental economy slash,

389
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,219
you know, some of the horror stories coming out of airbnb, right? We need some

390
00:16:34,979 --> 00:16:36,650
new norms for,

391
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,520
you know, how do I treat

392
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:43,419
-- an airbnb? How do I treat a bird scooter?
-- See, I would argue. We don't though.

393
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,609
So I mean,

394
00:16:44,619 --> 00:16:46,919
so I'm going to pick on airbnb here if you

395
00:16:46,929 --> 00:16:49,440
look at the history of the hospitality industry and,

396
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:52,109
and now I'm not a fan of airbnb, I'll just say that up front.

397
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:55,239
Right. I prefer hotels for a large number of reasons.

398
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:58,119
But the big one being like hotels have legal

399
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,469
frameworks and they have ways to deal with issues.

400
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:03,239
And so when I have a problem with a hotel, I go to the desk I can

401
00:17:03,486 --> 00:17:04,906
to them and they fix my problem.

402
00:17:04,915 --> 00:17:08,776
Basically, every time, the only time I ever had an issue was when I was,

403
00:17:08,786 --> 00:17:12,266
it was actually when I went to see the total solar eclipse

404
00:17:12,516 --> 00:17:15,776
and it was I was staying in some scary hillbilly hotel

405
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:17,146
man and I went to the desk and they're like,

406
00:17:17,156 --> 00:17:21,186
this is the only room like you can use it or or not use it like it's your choice.

407
00:17:21,196 --> 00:17:25,097
And it was literally the only hotel room for like hundreds of miles. So I stayed.

408
00:17:25,266 --> 00:17:27,786
But anyway, the point is so like we'll pick on airbnb here,

409
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:30,863
the legal framework that exists for the hospitality industry,

410
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,562
they're already skirting around them.

411
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:33,062
All right,

412
00:17:33,072 --> 00:17:34,253
because like we've talked about this

413
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:36,863
before airbnb is knowingly breaking countless

414
00:17:36,873 --> 00:17:39,463
laws and just ignoring them and they're getting away with it.

415
00:17:39,473 --> 00:17:41,333
But now at the same time,

416
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:45,723
the the many of the laws they're ignoring exist to protect things like like

417
00:17:45,883 --> 00:17:49,522
hotels. Like if you trash your hotel room, they're going to come after you, right?

418
00:17:49,532 --> 00:17:51,123
Whereas if you trash your airbnb,

419
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:55,571
right? Like happens next. It's not a good question. Oh, yeah.

420
00:17:55,581 --> 00:17:58,130
I know there's been horror stories of parties and, you know,

421
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,220
all sorts of shenanigans going on.

422
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,541
-- Right.
-- Right. Exactly.

423
00:18:01,551 --> 00:18:04,020
And so this is, this is where, like,

424
00:18:04,031 --> 00:18:07,500
it's time for airbnb to grow up and they need to work with their,

425
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:10,640
their local regulators to actually make this stuff work correctly.

426
00:18:10,651 --> 00:18:13,760
And I think bird scooters are the same story and this is,

427
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:17,020
in fact, I'm going to tie this back to the whole security industry in general is

428
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:17,949
we,

429
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:22,199
we have existed outside of like the normal structure of society

430
00:18:22,209 --> 00:18:24,430
and we think we're special and we're always talking about how,

431
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:27,339
oh, you can't possibly regulate security, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

432
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:28,339
But it's,

433
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:31,739
you know what you can't with today's laws and rules.

434
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,750
But one of the things we need to like,

435
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,390
like in all seriousness do is start thinking about

436
00:18:36,579 --> 00:18:37,780
how can we

437
00:18:38,165 --> 00:18:39,484
get to where we need to go

438
00:18:39,584 --> 00:18:43,055
and no, the rules and laws today don't work,

439
00:18:43,084 --> 00:18:45,444
but we need some that do because the world around

440
00:18:45,454 --> 00:18:47,385
us is changing and same thing for bird scooters,

441
00:18:47,395 --> 00:18:47,704
man.

442
00:18:47,714 --> 00:18:50,984
-- Well, see,
-- and my take on this would be, is the problem with rules and laws is that

443
00:18:51,295 --> 00:18:52,405
it's hard to get them

444
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,505
a sort of applied equally, right?

445
00:18:54,515 --> 00:18:57,185
Like what you'll have between Canada, the US or, you know,

446
00:18:57,194 --> 00:18:58,905
New Mexico and New Hampshire.

447
00:18:59,494 --> 00:19:01,045
And that's why I think it's important to come

448
00:19:01,055 --> 00:19:03,145
up with the sort of standards of behavior,

449
00:19:03,155 --> 00:19:05,185
whatever man, that's never going to work.

450
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:06,449
Well.

451
00:19:06,459 --> 00:19:08,000
It, it, it does though, for example,

452
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:10,329
like in the U SI was reading about how there's a lot of cities where,

453
00:19:10,339 --> 00:19:12,619
when there's a snowstorm, people go out onto the street,

454
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,680
they shovel out a parking spot and then they put their chair on it

455
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:16,420
and that means they kind of quasi

456
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:19,000
own that spot because they shoveled it out and,

457
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,030
and, you know, and, and the same thing happens locally, people will, uh,

458
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,859
for example,

459
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:25,119
we shovel our sidewalks usually and some people will

460
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,239
shovel the road in front of their house so they

461
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,770
can park on the road easily and they feel

462
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,780
a certain amount of ownership of that space and,

463
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,189
and I would be sort of inclined to somewhat agree with

464
00:19:33,199 --> 00:19:35,780
them because they put the effort to shovel that darn thing,

465
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:36,180
you know,

466
00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:39,589
and that can be a nontrivial amount of work sometimes.

467
00:19:40,329 --> 00:19:41,310
And so

468
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,229
I, I think part of the challenge with laws though is that

469
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,810
we get laws but they tend to be applied really, you know,

470
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:52,619
are, are the police really gonna want to spend time enforcing these laws?

471
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,739
No, they, they actually have real crime

472
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,660
to deal with

473
00:19:55,949 --> 00:19:57,410
and that's why I think it might be

474
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,810
in some ways better to get people

475
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,439
to, to sort of come up with. Ok, you know, like,

476
00:20:02,589 --> 00:20:03,910
for example, with bird scooters,

477
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,640
I think in general people wouldn't leave them

478
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,260
literally in the middle of the sidewalk.

479
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:10,199
As a tripping hazard. Or at least, I hope people would not do that.

480
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,510
-- And they would
-- realize I've seen many of them really

481
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,380
in the middle of the sidewalk in San Francisco,

482
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:14,589
man.

483
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:15,310
Yeah, it's,

484
00:20:15,709 --> 00:20:17,969
and now granted there's plenty, not parked in the middle,

485
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,369
-- but there's plenty that are, well,
-- because for example,

486
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,869
so many wheelchair then is up, you know,

487
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,839
up the creek without a paddle if the sidewalk is covered in these things.

488
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,199
Right. No, no, I, I agree. I agree completely. And it's,

489
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:30,530
but it's like any system, right,

490
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:35,130
99% of the people will follow some basic set of rules

491
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,089
and it's always that annoying 1% that ruin it for everybody.

492
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:42,020
But I, I think it's like, it's kind of one of those instances where again,

493
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:45,569
where we get, let's say, in a situation, like if,

494
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:48,310
let's say that that person who parked the bird scooter in the middle of the,

495
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:50,699
the sidewalk, if you park your car in the middle of the sidewalk,

496
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:53,349
like they just come tow it and then you'd have to pay to get it back.

497
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:53,859
Right.

498
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:55,714
Something like a bird scooters.

499
00:20:55,724 --> 00:20:59,344
It's going to be up to them to, let's say someone impounds a bird scooter.

500
00:20:59,354 --> 00:21:01,324
Whoever left it in the wrong spot is going to

501
00:21:01,334 --> 00:21:04,135
have to be responsible for dealing with that outcome.

502
00:21:04,145 --> 00:21:04,375
Well,

503
00:21:04,385 --> 00:21:07,155
the problem is what if the person who left it in the spot is an activist

504
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:10,405
who hates these things and it keeps moving them into the way so they get impounded.

505
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,729
Well, and that's again,

506
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:14,349
a place where by is going to have to use

507
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:16,910
some technology to figure it out because for example,

508
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,670
let's say I end my trip and it shows it's in the designated

509
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,670
parking area and then 20 minutes later in the middle of the street

510
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,109
I didn't do that

511
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,180
or, or if I did

512
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,030
II, I don't know, it seems like something insane that I, whatever.

513
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,280
See, and this is why I don't think the laws will work for this because

514
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:36,949
it's like, I mean, we have laws against littering and unless, you know,

515
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:40,390
they have a crackdown on it and actually go downtown and have people watching for it,

516
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,260
you know, these, this and I'm making air quotes here,

517
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:46,770
this crime or this infraction is so quick and so tiny,

518
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:51,540
you know, that enforcing it is the cost of enforcing it is

519
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:55,199
far more than sort of the impact of society.

520
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:57,780
And so from a cost benefit perspective, I'd say, well, yeah,

521
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,380
I don't really want the cops spending their time and money on this.

522
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:04,010
You know, they should be getting drunk drivers who destroy,

523
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,560
you know, cars.

524
00:22:06,489 --> 00:22:10,750
I, I think they, they do more often than not. So actually you just reminded me of,

525
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:13,589
I actually just published a blog post this morning.

526
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:16,140
It was, well, auto Publish Magic, right?

527
00:22:16,439 --> 00:22:17,069
And

528
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,709
I was talking about the fact that uh at ce S A computer electronics show,

529
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:23,560
I saw a lot of security people being like, oh,

530
00:22:23,569 --> 00:22:25,750
none of these companies are taking security seriously.

531
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,250
They're not talking about security

532
00:22:27,569 --> 00:22:28,750
and here's the thing and this,

533
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,150
this totally relates to what you were just talking about is

534
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,420
you need an incentive to drive any sort of behavior.

535
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:38,199
And from the perspective of security yelling at companies for not doing security.

536
00:22:38,209 --> 00:22:39,380
Right? Isn't an incentive.

537
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:42,459
You're just being annoying and, and their incentive is to not talk to you.

538
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,739
I think more to the point you're reminding them that they can

539
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,719
get away without doing it because all of like last I checked,

540
00:22:47,729 --> 00:22:49,880
all the Fortune 500 are still doing ok.

541
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,079
And none of them have fallen out of the

542
00:22:51,089 --> 00:22:53,380
-- Fortune 500 because of a security incident
-- and,

543
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:55,020
and even the ones who have been hacked

544
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,060
their, their stock price is great. Right?

545
00:22:57,069 --> 00:22:59,780
And so anyway, this is the same thing with bird scooters.

546
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,099
This is the same thing with littering.

547
00:23:01,109 --> 00:23:03,699
This is the same thing with anything that's going to happen at

548
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:07,560
all. And it's especially true with security and we, we suck at it is

549
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,436
you need an incentive

550
00:23:09,776 --> 00:23:11,786
and now often the incentive is money.

551
00:23:11,796 --> 00:23:13,485
And I mean, this even kind of goes back to our,

552
00:23:13,495 --> 00:23:16,395
our conversation about the eu bug bounty, right?

553
00:23:16,406 --> 00:23:19,576
Where the only incentive a lot of people understand is money,

554
00:23:19,586 --> 00:23:21,206
but it's not always money.

555
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:24,255
-- Sometimes it can be other things, but we can just focus on
-- money.

556
00:23:24,265 --> 00:23:26,576
Well, money is one of the most accessible incentives.

557
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:30,306
Right. It's something I can easily get and hand out

558
00:23:30,465 --> 00:23:33,156
-- and,
-- and it hurts to lose. So

559
00:23:33,326 --> 00:23:34,926
most people don't want to lose it for no

560
00:23:35,062 --> 00:23:35,612
reason.

561
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:37,171
And like that's what it comes down to.

562
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,972
Right, is if you need to modify someone's behavior,

563
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:41,891
you need to start finding by

564
00:23:42,011 --> 00:23:46,771
or airbnb or Uber or whoever, if they're not behaving the way you want them to

565
00:23:46,991 --> 00:23:52,852
and then it's up to those companies to basically find the passengers or riders or,

566
00:23:52,862 --> 00:23:55,562
or whoever, what do you call a person that stays at an airbnb?

567
00:23:55,572 --> 00:23:57,011
Do they have a name like guest?

568
00:23:57,661 --> 00:24:00,131
Airbnb guest is what airbnb says?

569
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:00,972
Ok,

570
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:01,829
that's fair.

571
00:24:02,209 --> 00:24:03,400
And, and you know what I mean?

572
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:07,359
If you trash the, if you trash something like you should be on the hook for that,

573
00:24:07,609 --> 00:24:11,329
you know, granted I know that if you cause say $400,000 worth of damage and,

574
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:14,479
and you have like a net worth of zero that creates some issues,

575
00:24:14,489 --> 00:24:16,959
but that's also where things like insurance need to exist.

576
00:24:16,969 --> 00:24:21,469
-- Yeah.
-- No, I think II I agree that we do need laws but I don't think the laws will,

577
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:23,719
I, I can't think of a good

578
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,729
way to phrase the law also without, you know, for example,

579
00:24:26,739 --> 00:24:28,239
basically giving activists the way to,

580
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,479
oh finally we can get rid of these damn scooters by just,

581
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,479
you know, kicking them over. So they're in the sidewalk and then

582
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:37,319
oops, it fell over and then, you know, they call 311 and have it towed.

583
00:24:37,329 --> 00:24:38,829
I, I don't disagree with you.

584
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:40,479
I think you are correct that the,

585
00:24:40,489 --> 00:24:44,369
the structure and way we do laws today doesn't necessarily

586
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,319
keep up with some of the technologies we have.

587
00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:47,280
But I also think,

588
00:24:47,489 --> 00:24:48,920
rather than just saying

589
00:24:49,219 --> 00:24:51,880
I give up, it's too hard. This is one of those places

590
00:24:52,609 --> 00:24:56,239
to say, how do we, how do we start to fix this in a meaningful way?

591
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:00,359
Well, I think part of it, for example is if the people using bird scooters were,

592
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:02,569
how do I put this nicely, less annoying about it,

593
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,300
then people might not be so angry about this. Right?

594
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:05,670
Because I,

595
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,819
I've seen some of those videos where these people on scooters

596
00:25:07,829 --> 00:25:10,199
or hoverboards or stuff are just bombing down the sidewalks,

597
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,380
-- you know, and they end up knocking somebody over.
-- Yeah, it's terrible.

598
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:16,270
Well, this exists, this is freaking bicycles, do it to me.

599
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,569
And I mean, I was actually on my bike, it was on the, during the summer, the last summer

600
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:21,979
and I remember I was,

601
00:25:21,989 --> 00:25:25,079
I was biking along and I saw this guy came whipping past me at about a

602
00:25:25,089 --> 00:25:26,780
million miles an hour and of course he

603
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,420
didn't announce himself or anything just like,

604
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,920
flew by me and there was like a family with little kids in front of him and I'm like,

605
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:32,619
oh my goodness.

606
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:33,089
No.

607
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,780
And like, this dude ended up crashing because he, like,

608
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:38,410
nearly ran into a little kid and I thought you freaking deserve that.

609
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:42,520
You big jerk. But it's like, you know, I mean, the scooters are no different.

610
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:46,979
There's just, there's some people who, who make it miserable for the rest of us.

611
00:25:47,569 --> 00:25:49,119
Oh, yeah, I know there's a walking path, uh,

612
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,359
here that's infamous for cars driving on it

613
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:55,670
because Google Maps sort of indicates and then they, they, they don't have those

614
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,609
boards in front of it for some reason. So,

615
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,369
uh, we've, I've almost been run over.

616
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,640
The funny thing is that the path used to dead end,

617
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,310
but now it actually connects to a parking lot.

618
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:06,729
So people will, like, literally drive down the whole thing and

619
00:26:06,979 --> 00:26:07,060
it's

620
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,900
-- a nightmare
-- and I assume it's about the width of a car,

621
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:10,250
right,

622
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,609
with a yellow line down the middle

623
00:26:11,819 --> 00:26:13,849
and, and so they're like driving over the top of the,

624
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:17,050
they know, right. Those people know you can't do that.

625
00:26:17,099 --> 00:26:20,290
Well, the majority of them honestly are Uber and taxis.

626
00:26:21,089 --> 00:26:22,030
They're just following

627
00:26:22,479 --> 00:26:23,209
because, like,

628
00:26:23,219 --> 00:26:24,949
there's some wonky geography in that area

629
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,569
with some fences in some apartment buildings.

630
00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:29,189
So it gets, if you don't kind of know what's going on and you're

631
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:29,609
like,

632
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:32,670
we can't get an Uber to my partner's place because they wait on a

633
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,959
block and a half away on the other side of this fence and,

634
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:37,130
like, refuse to come into the parking lot to the door.

635
00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:39,550
Right. These, these people are following the Uber instructions.

636
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,390
Google Maps knows how to do it. But, yeah, Uber, no.

637
00:26:42,979 --> 00:26:46,160
And, uh, but anyways back to this, so that's why I think we need to,

638
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:50,439
-- I don't know, an education campaign or just no
-- education won't work.

639
00:26:50,449 --> 00:26:51,010
Well,

640
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:53,660
there's some fundamental behaviors.

641
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:59,040
Like, if you are moving faster on some sort of, I'm going to say the word vehicle.

642
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,819
Be it a bicycle, a hoverboard or an electric scooter,

643
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:04,839
you know, you're going to be moving faster than people who are walking.

644
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:09,239
-- And then I would say it's on you to watch out for them. I would
-- argue. No.

645
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:10,800
Uh, here's the thing.

646
00:27:10,869 --> 00:27:12,500
This is just like, so I,

647
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:16,260
I remember trying to build some security education program some years ago

648
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:16,699
and,

649
00:27:16,709 --> 00:27:18,959
and I've given up even thinking it's possible because

650
00:27:18,969 --> 00:27:20,900
people don't care and they don't want to learn.

651
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:25,099
And I think expecting people to change their behavior voluntarily, like some will,

652
00:27:25,109 --> 00:27:29,140
don't get me wrong, but there's many who won't and there's enough who won't that it,

653
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:31,699
it basically ruins it for the rest of us.

654
00:27:31,709 --> 00:27:35,300
And so like, I'll, I'll, I'm going to pick on by here as the example. But like

655
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:38,890
the only plausible solution to bird scooters existing in your

656
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,810
city is to have bird scooter lanes in the street.

657
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:45,410
Like we have bike lanes, stick the bird scooters in them and let's face it.

658
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:49,109
They're about the same speed as most bicycles anyway. So get them off the sidewalk.

659
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:53,530
That is the only solution to bird scooters in a city is to get them off the sidewalk.

660
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,800
I suspect long term that

661
00:27:54,959 --> 00:27:57,839
that will happen is more of these alternative transportation,

662
00:27:57,849 --> 00:28:01,089
sort of that last mile thing happens, you know, between public transit

663
00:28:01,569 --> 00:28:04,020
self driving cars, you know, carpooling and stuff,

664
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,790
having that last mile be solved by bicycles or bird scooters,

665
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,069
I think actually would be quite nice.

666
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:10,989
-- But yeah, like you said, having separate lanes or having
-- it,

667
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,930
it's the only way it's going to work, expecting people to change their behavior is,

668
00:28:14,939 --> 00:28:16,089
is not an option.

669
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:16,750
And I think

670
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:19,189
the sooner the security industry

671
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:24,130
and I'm especially security industry realizes that trying to educate people,

672
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,229
like you can't educate most problems away.

673
00:28:26,239 --> 00:28:28,369
I won't say you can't educate any problems away,

674
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:31,599
but in the particular instance of what we're dealing with, you can't.

675
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,020
Well, I think you, you said something important there

676
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:38,790
where even if we do educate and we get 90 or 99% compliance,

677
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:40,449
for example, car driving,

678
00:28:40,459 --> 00:28:43,469
if 1% of people decide to drive on the other side of the road,

679
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,319
that's going to be bad

680
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:49,430
-- like that, that's going to be objectively really bad. Even one in 1000.
-- Right.

681
00:28:49,439 --> 00:28:50,359
Right. Exactly.

682
00:28:50,369 --> 00:28:54,089
And, and like that happens sometimes and it makes the news every time it happens.

683
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:54,319
Right.

684
00:28:54,329 --> 00:28:54,459
When,

685
00:28:54,469 --> 00:28:57,000
like some crazy old person drives down the wrong side of

686
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:00,079
the highway because they just caused a huge accident generally.

687
00:29:00,089 --> 00:29:02,760
So I guess the moral of the story

688
00:29:03,469 --> 00:29:04,770
is

689
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,739
all right. I, I can, I can cover this one. Number one,

690
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:13,630
don't go after Cory Doctorow because he will beat you. Right.

691
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,780
That's rule number one.

692
00:29:14,949 --> 00:29:16,650
-- And I'm comfortable with that
-- rule.

693
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:19,739
He has the eff and the internet on his side.

694
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:24,050
Right? Like the whole internet, right? Not just like the scary part of the internet.

695
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,239
So number one, leave coy doctor alone.

696
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:31,010
Uh number two is we can't fix people,

697
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,099
period.

698
00:29:32,449 --> 00:29:36,900
Like just stop trying to do it like security. I'm looking at you here, stop it.

699
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:41,560
And I guess rule number three is uh bird scooters are awesome

700
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,229
if you're on them and they're horrible if you're not.

701
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,260
That sounds fair.

702
00:29:46,479 --> 00:29:47,390
-- Yeah. All
-- right, man.

703
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:50,589
So I guess we'll end it there. So thank you for listening. Everybody.
