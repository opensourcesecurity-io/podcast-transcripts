Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,180
Kurt Siefried and my pertinent thought crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:11,289 --> 00:00:13,399
-- So
-- we have murder bees. Now that's no

3
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:14,399
murder hornets,

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,510
murder bees in the eighties. Remember?

5
00:00:17,139 --> 00:00:17,610
No dude.

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,670
I remember watching the CBS evening news and

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,649
they had like that graphic on the screen with

8
00:00:21,659 --> 00:00:23,399
like North and South America with like showing where

9
00:00:23,409 --> 00:00:24,639
the bees were in South America and that,

10
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:24,829
you know,

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,809
they'd kind of steadily march up the Rio Grande or whatever to the South

12
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:32,873
US and then eventually pop out kind of in the midline us because,

13
00:00:32,882 --> 00:00:34,002
you know, thank God for winter.

14
00:00:34,092 --> 00:00:37,202
-- Those weren't murder bees. Those are killer
-- bees.

15
00:00:37,323 --> 00:00:40,402
Yes. Africanized honey bees because we thought that was a good idea.

16
00:00:40,412 --> 00:00:45,243
-- But
-- everything's a good idea, especially with bees or stinging insects.

17
00:00:45,252 --> 00:00:45,402
Yeah.

18
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:48,923
But I love the fact that, I mean, for, you know, when they said it was murder hornets,

19
00:00:48,932 --> 00:00:50,402
I'm like, oh, that's a little bit, you know,

20
00:00:50,412 --> 00:00:52,425
and then they showed a picture of the size of it and I'm like, no,

21
00:00:52,436 --> 00:00:54,026
that is actually entirely correct.

22
00:00:54,035 --> 00:00:57,616
These things are two inches long. They're bigger than a quarter.

23
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,905
Like they're bigger than a Canadian or us quarter like

24
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:00,436
that.

25
00:01:00,605 --> 00:01:01,776
That's just not right.

26
00:01:01,785 --> 00:01:03,296
-- So,
-- strangely enough,

27
00:01:03,305 --> 00:01:07,346
I know a lot about these hornets because I became extremely interested

28
00:01:07,356 --> 00:01:10,736
in them a long time ago because of an oatmeal comic.

29
00:01:10,746 --> 00:01:13,295
I'll try to find a link to the comic. It's very good.

30
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:15,496
But the thing that makes them amazing

31
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,900
in a bad way is

32
00:01:18,029 --> 00:01:19,470
in, they're from Japan

33
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:20,730
and in Japan,

34
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:24,830
their honey bees have a defense mechanism to kill these hornets because

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,690
the honey bees die at

36
00:01:26,949 --> 00:01:30,819
a temperature like 10 degrees above the temperature of the hornets die at.

37
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,389
So the honey bees create like a ball around a hornet and then they

38
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,029
start vibrating and heating themselves up until the hornet cooks itself to death.

39
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,309
But most of the honey bees survive like it is bananas. What happens here?

40
00:01:41,413 --> 00:01:45,392
You know what my favorite animal adaptation is wombats. They have square poo.

41
00:01:45,402 --> 00:01:49,023
Why do they have square poo? So it doesn't roll or fall?

42
00:01:49,032 --> 00:01:52,792
So they mark their territory by making little square poops to mark their territory.

43
00:01:52,803 --> 00:01:56,873
How on earth evolutionarily speaking, how do you get to that point?

44
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:58,553
When I learned that

45
00:01:58,712 --> 00:02:02,432
-- I thought the person who told it to me was trolling
-- me. Me too. Me too.

46
00:02:02,443 --> 00:02:06,242
I like, I like check Wikipedia and I'm like, OK, somebody hacked Wikipedia.

47
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:06,873
Let's, you know,

48
00:02:06,975 --> 00:02:11,315
like I found reputable, you know, zoological papers. Yeah. No, it's true.

49
00:02:11,326 --> 00:02:14,276
Like square poop, square ish poop, not perfectly cubed.

50
00:02:14,285 --> 00:02:17,026
-- Obviously that would hurt
-- either way, whatever,

51
00:02:17,035 --> 00:02:20,195
whatever animals in nature are ridiculous.

52
00:02:20,205 --> 00:02:21,785
Like, I mean, it's one thing to pee on stuff,

53
00:02:21,796 --> 00:02:23,425
like dogs pee on stuff constantly to mark.

54
00:02:24,205 --> 00:02:28,266
-- That's not very kind of like, ok, whatever, but like square poop man like that.
-- Just

55
00:02:28,526 --> 00:02:32,395
everything in Australia has dialed it up to an 11.

56
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,509
Everything

57
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:34,589
that voice

58
00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:37,809
is bananas actually, you know, it's really interesting.

59
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,589
So there something due to the, my reading about murder bees,

60
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,949
I'm going to keep calling it murder bees.

61
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,869
I don't care if it's wrong.

62
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:49,600
But reading about murder bees, one of the topics that came up was there is a Peppa pig.

63
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,089
Peppa pig is a children's cartoon, a Peppa pig episode about spiders.

64
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,820
That's like, oh, you shouldn't be afraid of spiders.

65
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,893
And in Australia they banned it because in

66
00:02:56,902 --> 00:02:59,703
Australia you definitely should be afraid of spiders.

67
00:03:00,503 --> 00:03:01,703
I was actually wrong the other day.

68
00:03:01,712 --> 00:03:05,283
I told my son there's no poisonous spiders in Canada and then I was like,

69
00:03:05,292 --> 00:03:06,582
wait a second and I double checked on that.

70
00:03:06,593 --> 00:03:09,113
There are now in Ontario, black widows and whatnot.

71
00:03:09,593 --> 00:03:12,893
That's fair. Fortunately, we only have one kind of venomous snake in

72
00:03:13,063 --> 00:03:16,352
Al in Canada and it's so it's pretty rare. You'd have to go looking for it.

73
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:19,132
I mean, generally speaking where we live,

74
00:03:19,343 --> 00:03:24,156
-- most animals and insects aren't going to kill us.
-- We have coyotes.

75
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:27,516
-- How many human deaths are there due to coyotes per year?
-- Oh, very few.

76
00:03:27,526 --> 00:03:28,716
But people have been attacked.

77
00:03:28,725 --> 00:03:30,985
My favorite was when they had like a lynx or something.

78
00:03:31,126 --> 00:03:33,636
You know, we've told this story before, but they had this lynx and the guy was like,

79
00:03:33,645 --> 00:03:34,356
no, no, no, it's ok.

80
00:03:34,365 --> 00:03:35,815
I was like 30 ft away from it and I'm like, dude,

81
00:03:35,826 --> 00:03:39,755
a house cat can mess you up from 30 ft away before you can blink like a lynx.

82
00:03:39,766 --> 00:03:43,406
-- 50 pounds of angry murder meat.
-- They could get angry. I suppose

83
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:45,550
they're not like bears.

84
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,059
-- Friendly bears a
-- well, I mean,

85
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:51,750
-- we've got those cinnamon bears now which there's
-- nice bears and mean bears,

86
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,750
friendly bears.

87
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:56,350
-- Happy bears.
-- You're forgetting about polar bears, which are an apex predator.

88
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,389
Actually, I have another wonderful thing.

89
00:03:58,399 --> 00:04:01,350
So when I was a kid there was this zoo we used to go to

90
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,710
and I'm going to use the word zoo with a lot of poetic license here.

91
00:04:04,809 --> 00:04:06,050
Those us animal.

92
00:04:06,059 --> 00:04:09,190
Yeah, it's pretty clear to me now as an adult, it was really not a zoo,

93
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,089
but they had a bear in a cage and you could buy soda,

94
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,250
which was just like sugar water in a bottle

95
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:16,959
and you could feed the bear soda through the cage.

96
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,950
You like stuck the bottle through a hole in the cage.

97
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,988
That's the most American thing I've ever heard.

98
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,320
-- Yeah, it kind of is in hindsight, poor
-- bear probably had diabetes.

99
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:28,839
-- Whatever
-- man, that bear was probably living the best bear life ever. It died happy.

100
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,709
I'm sure it got really good at, like,

101
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,709
you'd stick the bottle through and it would grab onto the bottle so you couldn't

102
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,970
pull it back out and then it would drink all of it and then,

103
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,109
like, go like that bear, it knew it was up.

104
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:38,820
Anyway.

105
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,070
Anyway,

106
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,640
we're going to talk about software

107
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:45,000
updates today because that's less horrifying than

108
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:45,440
murder.

109
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:46,720
I

110
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,750
-- think we'll get to the horrifying part.
-- I

111
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,269
think we will too.

112
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,380
So, like to be clear, I am not against software updates.

113
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,529
-- I'm,
-- I'm just going to be against them because I can.

114
00:04:56,809 --> 00:04:57,480
Yeah, that's fair.

115
00:04:57,489 --> 00:05:00,700
What gets me about software updates is, you know, on the one hand,

116
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:01,880
like everybody on the planet,

117
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,970
I want my system to be 100% stable and just perfectly work all the time.

118
00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:09,399
But I also want all the new features

119
00:05:09,549 --> 00:05:13,670
-- also
-- true
-- and all the bugs also true and all the security flaws and everything fixed

120
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:15,130
also true. All those things are,

121
00:05:15,421 --> 00:05:19,332
you know, without impacting stability or making me do much work. Exactly.

122
00:05:19,342 --> 00:05:23,652
So can I please have, you know what my cake and eat it and sell it to somebody else?

123
00:05:23,661 --> 00:05:25,261
Of course, it'll be fine. Yeah.

124
00:05:25,272 --> 00:05:28,532
And so I think one of the biggest problems here is traditionally,

125
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,502
we haven't really made a strong distinction between different

126
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:34,052
kinds of computing systems because we didn't really have different

127
00:05:34,062 --> 00:05:36,701
kinds of computing systems up until a decade or

128
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:39,721
-- two ago
-- before we go down this rat hole.

129
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:42,381
Why are we talking about software updates

130
00:05:42,492 --> 00:05:43,231
today?

131
00:05:43,421 --> 00:05:43,562
Oh,

132
00:05:43,664 --> 00:05:43,713
Buntu

133
00:05:44,074 --> 00:05:48,444
released a new version 20.04. It's a long term support version. What is it?

134
00:05:48,454 --> 00:05:51,813
-- Every two versions? 1416 1820.
-- If you don't know the

135
00:05:51,963 --> 00:05:54,604
ubuntu support model, go look it up and then come back.

136
00:05:54,614 --> 00:05:57,484
-- It's too complicated and weird to explain.
-- Right. Anyways.

137
00:05:57,493 --> 00:05:59,194
So it's a long term support version.

138
00:05:59,204 --> 00:06:01,803
That means it'll, you can run it for many, many years.

139
00:06:01,813 --> 00:06:03,723
Hopefully it'll be boring and just work and sort

140
00:06:03,734 --> 00:06:05,954
of two things they're doing that are really annoying.

141
00:06:05,963 --> 00:06:09,084
People are number one, they're using this software packaging called Snap.

142
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:12,044
Well, those aren't new. No, it's not new, but they're more heavily

143
00:06:12,145 --> 00:06:12,876
relying on it.

144
00:06:12,885 --> 00:06:17,406
-- That's fair related to this is they're going to a forced update
-- model,

145
00:06:17,415 --> 00:06:18,885
which is kind of new.

146
00:06:18,895 --> 00:06:25,365
And so what that means is you install your snaps and nearly everything is a snap.

147
00:06:25,376 --> 00:06:26,996
Now, a great example is Google Chrome,

148
00:06:27,006 --> 00:06:30,365
I believe is only available as a snap in the new version of

149
00:06:30,596 --> 00:06:33,985
ubuntu, I install Google Chrome, I get it as their snap.

150
00:06:33,996 --> 00:06:38,406
And then I basically, it's going to be magically upgraded whether I want it to or not.

151
00:06:38,415 --> 00:06:40,406
Obviously, in the case of Google Chrome,

152
00:06:40,627 --> 00:06:42,888
I want it to be updated. So I won't complain very much.

153
00:06:42,898 --> 00:06:46,518
But there are always things on a lytic system where you

154
00:06:46,528 --> 00:06:49,898
don't want to install an update because something stupid breaks.

155
00:06:49,907 --> 00:06:50,428
And

156
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:53,328
-- that is its own weird problem
-- right there.

157
00:06:53,338 --> 00:06:56,088
You stated the problem without realizing it on a Linux system.

158
00:06:56,097 --> 00:06:59,528
-- Can you define a Linux system? For me?
-- Everything is a Linux system now, right?

159
00:06:59,537 --> 00:07:03,398
But I mean, there's a big difference between, you know, a desktop Linux system,

160
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:04,678
a server, Linux system,

161
00:07:04,687 --> 00:07:08,528
a routing server and my light bulbs which are I'm guessing running Linux

162
00:07:09,109 --> 00:07:11,489
everything does. I mean, and that's a really good point.

163
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,230
And so this is, it's funny you bring this up. This was a conversation.

164
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:18,609
I remember I had a long time ago with some developers from the Ganon

165
00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:21,850
project because they were all about, oh, we should force updates on people.

166
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,890
And I was like, I don't think that's a good idea.

167
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,649
And after a lot of beers and a lot of talking,

168
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:32,600
we realized that a desktop for people is a very different story than

169
00:07:32,609 --> 00:07:35,760
a server and like a server should never ever automatically install updates.

170
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:37,489
Whereas a desktop you're probably

171
00:07:37,592 --> 00:07:38,312
OK there.

172
00:07:38,321 --> 00:07:43,071
-- So
-- again, this, this goes to sort of history and how things have changed in the past

173
00:07:43,242 --> 00:07:45,252
a computer that was a desktop.

174
00:07:45,261 --> 00:07:49,511
Definitely somebody had physical access to it and could like repower it or

175
00:07:49,522 --> 00:07:53,261
troubleshoot it or otherwise interact with it face to face as it were.

176
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:57,041
Sure that's still mostly true.

177
00:07:57,052 --> 00:07:58,971
I mean, there are virtual desktops and that is taking off,

178
00:07:58,981 --> 00:08:01,432
especially with the whole everybody working from home thing using

179
00:08:01,441 --> 00:08:05,891
their insecure gaming pcs to access back end offices with virtual

180
00:08:06,074 --> 00:08:07,473
desktop environments,

181
00:08:07,484 --> 00:08:11,734
we get to that sort of server style usage of the computer where for example,

182
00:08:11,743 --> 00:08:13,644
I as the user, I can't turn it off and on.

183
00:08:13,653 --> 00:08:17,174
-- I don't have that level of access,
-- but you probably don't need to.

184
00:08:17,194 --> 00:08:21,493
So what I'm trying to get at is is when my desktop computer does something goofy,

185
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:25,033
I can physically interact with it and try and kind of fix it or troubleshoot it.

186
00:08:25,044 --> 00:08:28,414
Whereas if a server dies and you can't ssh into it. Great.

187
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:31,093
I hope somebody has keys to that room in a car, time to go find it.

188
00:08:31,204 --> 00:08:34,494
-- It's all in the cloud now. It's fine.
-- Hopefully.

189
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,219
And so I think that's one of the big things is we need to make a distinction between,

190
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:42,390
there are systems that you cannot just randomly reboot because

191
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,960
if you do that people will die medical systems.

192
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,849
I remember having this discussion. Do you remember?

193
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:50,690
Oh, jeez, this is going way back. I just call him by his first name. I think it was Dave.

194
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,109
Remember he worked at the University of Washington and he did a lot of the

195
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:54,940
early work on distributed denial of service

196
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,260
attacks and at the University of Washington.

197
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,099
And the problem was I was like, well, ok, cool.

198
00:08:59,109 --> 00:09:00,630
Like, so you have these computers that, you know,

199
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,059
are infected with malware and bots and stuff doing D

200
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,109
DOS attacks, tell

201
00:09:04,226 --> 00:09:05,937
people to go fix them or boot them off the network.

202
00:09:05,947 --> 00:09:08,747
And he's like, yeah, I can't, it's an MRI machine, right.

203
00:09:08,796 --> 00:09:12,437
You know, and I was like, oh, well, ok. Yeah. Don't boot that off the network.

204
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,687
Well, why don't you figure out what it is and boot it?

205
00:09:14,697 --> 00:09:17,716
And he's like, because we can't, half the time we don't know what it is like, you know,

206
00:09:17,726 --> 00:09:19,046
to trace it down and figure out what it

207
00:09:19,057 --> 00:09:21,447
is and if it's life critical or safety critical,

208
00:09:21,456 --> 00:09:23,606
you know what if it's the PC controlling your elevators,

209
00:09:23,617 --> 00:09:26,327
you're I think conflating a bunch of different things.

210
00:09:26,336 --> 00:09:30,387
Let's ignore that problem. For now, MRI machines, let's focus on

211
00:09:30,807 --> 00:09:33,267
TU specifically because we're going to see two big you

212
00:09:33,374 --> 00:09:37,114
cases, there's a desktop and there's a server and when you're using a desktop,

213
00:09:37,124 --> 00:09:41,814
do we think automatic updates are acceptable to be just like magically installed?

214
00:09:41,823 --> 00:09:45,133
And the user can't say don't install this update right now.

215
00:09:45,164 --> 00:09:46,874
I think that should be up to the user.

216
00:09:46,883 --> 00:09:50,304
I mean, now here's my comment, I'm going to say by default,

217
00:09:50,314 --> 00:09:53,424
we should have automatic updates on desktops and the user

218
00:09:53,504 --> 00:09:55,393
or the rather I should say not the user,

219
00:09:55,403 --> 00:09:59,213
the administrator of that system should be allowed to control them.

220
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:02,443
-- But
-- what happens with the administrator is my parents.

221
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,810
That's why you default to them being on and if they

222
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,651
don't know what they're doing and they don't touch anything,

223
00:10:06,661 --> 00:10:08,020
then it just automatically updates.

224
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:08,921
I agree with that.

225
00:10:08,931 --> 00:10:12,770
Now, the funny thing about that is Windows does that and you can, for example,

226
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:15,911
Windows will pop up the box and say, oh, I need to install updates.

227
00:10:15,921 --> 00:10:17,181
Should I do it now or? Wait?

228
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:20,851
-- You can click. Everyone. Always clicks. Wait,
-- I like that. It's gotten smarter.

229
00:10:20,861 --> 00:10:23,190
It's, well, at least on the Macs they've gotten smarter.

230
00:10:23,351 --> 00:10:26,861
It's basically do it in an hour, do it tonight or later.

231
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,531
-- And I think that's a much better solution.
-- Windows can do that now too. Oh, it does.

232
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,687
Ok. Yeah. Well, but that didn't at first.

233
00:10:32,697 --> 00:10:33,367
And so it was always,

234
00:10:33,377 --> 00:10:35,317
I remember I was at a conference one time and the

235
00:10:35,328 --> 00:10:38,648
presenter opens up your computer and Windows is like f you,

236
00:10:38,658 --> 00:10:39,838
I'm updating now.

237
00:10:40,197 --> 00:10:42,288
Well, this is neat. And

238
00:10:42,648 --> 00:10:43,247
then of course,

239
00:10:43,257 --> 00:10:47,088
the presenter had to get a new computer and shuffle it all around and everything.

240
00:10:47,098 --> 00:10:51,088
But it's like the perfect example of why forcing things

241
00:10:51,098 --> 00:10:53,247
on people without giving them the ability to be,

242
00:10:53,257 --> 00:10:56,728
like, hang on there for a minute is hilariously bad.

243
00:10:57,158 --> 00:10:57,427
Yeah.

244
00:10:57,437 --> 00:10:57,768
I mean,

245
00:10:57,778 --> 00:11:00,737
and even a regular desktop computer for all we know somebody's

246
00:11:00,815 --> 00:11:03,234
to be using it to deal with some sort of time,

247
00:11:03,244 --> 00:11:04,794
critical, sensitive problem.

248
00:11:04,804 --> 00:11:06,604
Probably not going to result in loss of human life.

249
00:11:06,614 --> 00:11:09,594
But, you know, could be very uncomfortable and awkward for all concerns.

250
00:11:09,604 --> 00:11:10,715
There's a possibility.

251
00:11:10,724 --> 00:11:12,844
But I think bringing that into the conversation

252
00:11:12,854 --> 00:11:15,325
changes the conversation in a way that's unhelpful.

253
00:11:15,335 --> 00:11:17,104
Let's talk about servers.

254
00:11:17,114 --> 00:11:21,155
If you have a server that's automatically installing updates. Yeah, don't do that.

255
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:24,405
It really depends on its own because some, here's the thing you've got to remember.

256
00:11:24,414 --> 00:11:26,094
There are different kinds of software.

257
00:11:26,104 --> 00:11:28,015
For example, there's software that, well,

258
00:11:28,025 --> 00:11:31,481
a great example being the old Inet D right, you connect into a machine

259
00:11:31,661 --> 00:11:35,382
in NE D, fires off telnet or SSH or something to service your connection,

260
00:11:35,392 --> 00:11:37,361
your connection is serviced, it goes away.

261
00:11:37,512 --> 00:11:41,202
And so for example, there, if you do an update of the software,

262
00:11:41,211 --> 00:11:43,161
you change the bits on the disk.

263
00:11:43,211 --> 00:11:44,831
The next time that server is

264
00:11:44,981 --> 00:11:47,661
that service rather is run, it gets the newest version.

265
00:11:47,671 --> 00:11:50,421
Now, for example, a web server like Apache,

266
00:11:50,432 --> 00:11:52,062
you can't just change the bits on the disk

267
00:11:52,072 --> 00:11:54,271
and the version running sort of magically updates itself.

268
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:55,421
You have to restart that server.

269
00:11:55,432 --> 00:11:58,341
And that's a big problem is the vast majority of services

270
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:01,708
now are not run from like an ID style configuration.

271
00:12:01,718 --> 00:12:05,369
They're run like as a background service, you have to restart the service

272
00:12:05,609 --> 00:12:06,088
and

273
00:12:06,318 --> 00:12:08,049
that at a minimum gives you

274
00:12:08,189 --> 00:12:08,198
a

275
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:09,739
small interruption.

276
00:12:09,749 --> 00:12:11,598
Now, if you engineer your systems correctly, you know,

277
00:12:11,609 --> 00:12:15,179
you have multiple back ends and you do a rolling reboot, nobody will ever notice,

278
00:12:15,189 --> 00:12:15,499
right.

279
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,249
But the problem is that also assumes that that

280
00:12:17,258 --> 00:12:19,528
restart will work and they don't always work.

281
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:22,348
Ignoring the problem of restarting the service.

282
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:28,068
It's super common for Linux distributions these days to add features or

283
00:12:28,406 --> 00:12:29,495
they break something.

284
00:12:29,505 --> 00:12:32,445
There's a new configuration option like, especially, I mean, I would,

285
00:12:32,455 --> 00:12:35,676
I would consider Ubuntu more on the bleeding edge side of things.

286
00:12:35,685 --> 00:12:38,226
There's things like, you know, Cento S and Red Hat Enterprise,

287
00:12:38,236 --> 00:12:40,916
Linux that are definitely more conservative

288
00:12:41,046 --> 00:12:43,166
and those are substantially more trustworthy.

289
00:12:43,176 --> 00:12:46,916
Even Debbie and stable honestly falls into that camp where I can't think of the last

290
00:12:46,926 --> 00:12:50,556
time I did an update on a Debbie and Stable machine and had anything go wrong.

291
00:12:50,565 --> 00:12:51,536
Whereas Fedora

292
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:54,575
Unamuno, every time I run an update, it's like,

293
00:12:54,695 --> 00:12:56,585
I wonder what's going to break now

294
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:58,510
pretty much.

295
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,469
And, and then that speaks to the, again, giving the user control of,

296
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:04,559
I want to update 1% of my machines.

297
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:05,390
See what happens.

298
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:10,159
Then I'll try 10% see what happens and then maybe do the other, you know, 39%.

299
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:14,830
So that gets me to half are updated and then do 50%. I want to have some control over it.

300
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,469
Not.

301
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:17,650
Oh, well, it's, you know, it's Microsoft patch, Tuesday,

302
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:19,405
everything gets reboot it and forcibly updated.

303
00:13:19,414 --> 00:13:21,825
Now, whether I like it or not, in the case of ubuntu, it's,

304
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:25,205
I think there has like a two month time out at which point at the end of two months,

305
00:13:25,215 --> 00:13:26,784
it forcibly does the update.

306
00:13:26,794 --> 00:13:29,875
And so here's what makes the ubuntu problem and

307
00:13:29,885 --> 00:13:32,775
I'll call it a problem more interesting as well.

308
00:13:32,784 --> 00:13:36,965
Is there is a blog post that's going to be in the show notes and I'll even,

309
00:13:36,974 --> 00:13:38,924
I'll specifically link to the forum

310
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,679
where the person who wrote the blog post kind of

311
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,489
submitted a question to the forum and was saying,

312
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,369
you know, hey, I don't like this.

313
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,599
What's up? And the

314
00:13:46,989 --> 00:13:50,849
Ubuntu people were surprisingly unsympathetic.

315
00:13:50,859 --> 00:13:54,099
-- I would say as to this,
-- literally, their tone was well, we discussed this and we

316
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:58,780
to do X right to put it bluntly within their context, their framework,

317
00:13:58,789 --> 00:13:59,669
their reality.

318
00:13:59,989 --> 00:14:01,809
Yeah, I can see why they would say that and do that.

319
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:02,570
But

320
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,789
yeah, for them,

321
00:14:04,359 --> 00:14:06,640
here's what frustrates me is that they are taking

322
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,250
away control of the system from the user.

323
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,929
And this is something, for example, people complain about with mobile devices,

324
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,330
right?

325
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,130
I can't make my phone do XY or Z I mean we have a show about

326
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,440
this where you know the apple walled garden consists of like look at the flowers,

327
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:22,169
smell, the flowers, do not touch the flowers, you know,

328
00:14:22,179 --> 00:14:24,409
you get shot in the stomach and that's your warning shot.

329
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:24,849
Well,

330
00:14:24,859 --> 00:14:30,809
and like so this has been one of my complaints for a long time is I feel like Ubuntu

331
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:34,559
has been jealous of Apple in trying to mimic a lot of their,

332
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,145
-- well,
-- they're really chasing this desktop market heavily,

333
00:14:38,156 --> 00:14:40,976
which I get it because that's sort of the visible Linux market.

334
00:14:40,986 --> 00:14:43,505
I mean, you and I, you know, let's face it, right.

335
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:46,695
I've been using Linux on and off the desktop for, well,

336
00:14:46,705 --> 00:14:50,356
I tried starting 25 years ago and I literally would set aside two weeks every

337
00:14:50,366 --> 00:14:53,375
summer where I would force myself to put the latest version of whatever cool.

338
00:14:53,385 --> 00:14:55,705
Linux was on my desktop and force myself to

339
00:14:55,716 --> 00:14:58,846
get it up and running and totally perfectly running,

340
00:14:58,856 --> 00:14:59,585
you know, for two weeks,

341
00:14:59,911 --> 00:15:02,432
you know, so that way you get all the little glitchy things like, oh, you know,

342
00:15:02,442 --> 00:15:03,981
I also need this file supporter.

343
00:15:03,992 --> 00:15:06,161
Oh, I forgot that I need to do this or whatever.

344
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:09,442
I did run Linux on the desktop for a number of years. And then honestly,

345
00:15:09,711 --> 00:15:13,721
Windows stopped sucking, basically run Windows seven. I was like, you know what?

346
00:15:13,731 --> 00:15:16,752
This is good enough. It drives eight monitors, sound works, everything just works.

347
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:19,601
I have virtual machines and then, you know, then I moved to Max

348
00:15:19,771 --> 00:15:20,591
and I gave up, I'm,

349
00:15:20,692 --> 00:15:24,521
I'm still a believer. I run Linux on my desktop every day.

350
00:15:24,859 --> 00:15:26,909
Well, technically I have chromebooks now.

351
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:29,479
So I, you know, I am using Linux on a desktop but, you know,

352
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:30,299
it's basically a

353
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:32,280
-- real deal
-- and

354
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:38,250
here is what I would say to that is I've been writing Linux on the desktop for probably

355
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:43,309
20 years exclusively and I had a two year stint with a Mac for work and I hated it

356
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,596
-- because I'm just like a brainwashed zombie. At this point
-- in fairness.

357
00:15:46,606 --> 00:15:49,205
There are some really nasty glitches in Mac

358
00:15:49,226 --> 00:15:51,185
Os and when you encounter those nasty glitches,

359
00:15:51,195 --> 00:15:52,885
that's it that you can't fix them.

360
00:15:52,895 --> 00:15:55,265
You know what it really came down to was just like,

361
00:15:55,276 --> 00:15:59,315
I'm a shell junkie and while the shell experience isn't terrible on the Mac,

362
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:00,765
it's not amazing either.

363
00:16:00,776 --> 00:16:02,435
You have to install G set. Otherwise

364
00:16:02,736 --> 00:16:04,596
N doesn't work. I don't even know what you just said.

365
00:16:04,606 --> 00:16:08,202
I said the, you know, the, the line serial editor,

366
00:16:09,442 --> 00:16:13,841
you have to install G set. Otherwise when you would like max default set,

367
00:16:14,072 --> 00:16:16,291
you try and tell it like, you know, replace this character,

368
00:16:16,302 --> 00:16:18,151
-- put in the liner turn and it barfs,
-- whatever,

369
00:16:18,302 --> 00:16:18,932
no one runs that

370
00:16:19,492 --> 00:16:20,411
I do it like

371
00:16:20,531 --> 00:16:24,692
-- three times a week because people need me to manipulate CS V files,
-- maybe whatever.

372
00:16:24,731 --> 00:16:26,442
I just write a Python script. Anyway,

373
00:16:26,802 --> 00:16:27,382
so

374
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,679
I gave up on set and a,

375
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:33,179
a long time ago, I just write Python now. Anyway. Anyway,

376
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:37,760
the point is so having experienced Mac for a while,

377
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,130
it is apparent to me that the Linux desktop,

378
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,690
people are jealous of the Mac and they want to be Apple and they want to be

379
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,940
able to force things on people and say you do it our way or you shut up.

380
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:48,250
I mean,

381
00:16:48,362 --> 00:16:48,752
honestly,

382
00:16:48,763 --> 00:16:51,922
the whole point to running Linux is not to have someone tell

383
00:16:51,932 --> 00:16:54,682
you do it our way or shut up and you can argue.

384
00:16:54,692 --> 00:16:54,752
Oh,

385
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,703
but you can install a different window manager and

386
00:16:56,713 --> 00:16:58,872
you can install a different distribution or whatever.

387
00:16:58,882 --> 00:17:01,543
-- But like
-- the problem is not that they're saying do it our way or shut up.

388
00:17:01,552 --> 00:17:04,343
They're taking away your choice and forcing you to do it their way.

389
00:17:04,353 --> 00:17:08,771
-- That's the same thing. You're splitting hairs.
-- Again, we go back to the,

390
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:12,855
give me a reasonable default that I can change so that the argument being for. Ok.

391
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,105
My parents, yeah, fine.

392
00:17:14,115 --> 00:17:16,635
They get automatic updates and they live with the machine just

393
00:17:16,645 --> 00:17:19,224
randomly saying I need to reboot right now for an update.

394
00:17:19,234 --> 00:17:20,786
So you better have saved your work, right?

395
00:17:20,796 --> 00:17:23,365
Whereas, you know, those of us running it on servers are like, no,

396
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,875
I want a maintenance window at three in the morning

397
00:17:24,885 --> 00:17:27,595
or the maintenance window is when I run it.

398
00:17:27,855 --> 00:17:28,836
Yeah, exactly.

399
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,609
And

400
00:17:31,459 --> 00:17:34,780
yeah, it's, it's interesting to see this.

401
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,219
It's weird to me because like,

402
00:17:36,229 --> 00:17:40,219
my number one takeaway from Linux was always that for good or for bad.

403
00:17:40,229 --> 00:17:45,260
Here's the config files, right? Like you can go touch the config files and slash E DC.

404
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,219
It's, they're reasonably clear, you know,

405
00:17:47,229 --> 00:17:49,900
you compare that to like the Windows registry experience where it's like,

406
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:52,579
I want to configure something to do this and you google it for a bit and then it's like,

407
00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:54,609
ok, go in with the registry editor and, you know,

408
00:17:54,619 --> 00:17:58,290
-- create ad string with this value and I'm just like, oh, I'm
-- like, De

409
00:17:58,449 --> 00:18:00,484
-- Nome has that now.
-- Yeah, exactly.

410
00:18:00,744 --> 00:18:03,265
And it's, you know, I feel like, I feel like I'm, you know, it's like, ok,

411
00:18:03,275 --> 00:18:05,344
cut the red wire, which red wire they're all red, you know,

412
00:18:05,354 --> 00:18:06,734
is that one Maroon or is it red?

413
00:18:07,285 --> 00:18:10,444
You know, and I feel like, you know, like one of those movie tropes where, you know,

414
00:18:10,454 --> 00:18:12,464
somebody's like, you know, the bombs counting down.

415
00:18:12,474 --> 00:18:15,814
I got like five seconds left to go and I got to make this thing work versus, you know,

416
00:18:15,824 --> 00:18:17,214
a config file where it's like,

417
00:18:17,224 --> 00:18:20,594
I literally go copy config file to config file dot

418
00:18:20,604 --> 00:18:22,635
or Ridge and then I monkey with the config file.

419
00:18:22,645 --> 00:18:23,864
Did it break? No? Cool.

420
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,824
And I leave the original there too with stuff like the

421
00:18:25,834 --> 00:18:29,234
registry editing and the way these systems are being moved,

422
00:18:29,449 --> 00:18:32,930
it's kind of like you touch that configuration, it might,

423
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,609
you might regret it just to take it away from me entirely. Like

424
00:18:36,729 --> 00:18:41,920
I, I was planning to do like an upgrade from Ubuntu 18 to Ubuntu and 20 in production.

425
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,589
And now I'm like, no, we're just going to skip it.

426
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:47,910
Stay on Ubuntu 18 and transition to platform as a service.

427
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,430
Now, I assume their containers don't have this problem.

428
00:18:52,439 --> 00:18:55,630
Well, the thing is the way you're supposed to use containers is that, you know,

429
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,209
they don't live for very long and you instantiate a new version of the

430
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:01,677
with all the software up to date, run it through your C ID system.

431
00:19:01,687 --> 00:19:04,348
It works, it doesn't work if it works, you deploy it, if it doesn't work, you know,

432
00:19:04,358 --> 00:19:09,057
-- you go chase down the flaws
-- if the snap updater is running in your container?

433
00:19:09,067 --> 00:19:12,578
Is it going to be like I need to update myself now because

434
00:19:12,588 --> 00:19:15,868
it's been a really long time and I hope they didn't do that.

435
00:19:15,878 --> 00:19:17,937
But if they did that's beyond idiotic.

436
00:19:17,947 --> 00:19:20,417
Well, again, that goes to the whole continent,

437
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:24,618
you're not supposed to be running containers for months or years on end.

438
00:19:24,628 --> 00:19:25,218
-- Oh,
-- whatever,

439
00:19:25,228 --> 00:19:26,537
everyone does. I know. But

440
00:19:26,787 --> 00:19:31,186
even you don't run it for months. What if, what if the container was built a year ago?

441
00:19:31,196 --> 00:19:34,546
It starts up and snap says, oh man, I haven't updated it in a year.

442
00:19:34,556 --> 00:19:36,086
It's time to update everybody.

443
00:19:36,095 --> 00:19:39,965
Your process should be to build a fresh container before deploy.

444
00:19:40,276 --> 00:19:42,395
That's not practical.

445
00:19:42,536 --> 00:19:46,225
I know. But the thing is if you don't do those things, then this is the risk you run.

446
00:19:46,235 --> 00:19:49,765
This is the modern world, the world has changed, right? The world has changed.

447
00:19:49,776 --> 00:19:52,845
If you're not doing C ID, then yeah, you're,

448
00:19:52,855 --> 00:19:55,095
you're going to be at odds with how the majority

449
00:19:55,105 --> 00:19:58,193
of the world is now viewing and using software and it's

450
00:19:58,203 --> 00:20:00,154
going to suck you and I both work for a vendor

451
00:20:00,163 --> 00:20:03,134
where the principal idea was take a version of software,

452
00:20:03,144 --> 00:20:03,553
freeze it n

453
00:20:03,793 --> 00:20:05,543
for 13 years, right?

454
00:20:05,654 --> 00:20:09,284
The reality is there are a lot of people willing to pay a lot of money for that.

455
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,093
They're out of sync with sort of modern reality, right?

456
00:20:12,104 --> 00:20:13,043
In the sense of that,

457
00:20:13,053 --> 00:20:17,614
the only way to do that is to pay a vendor a huge amount of money to service that for you.

458
00:20:17,663 --> 00:20:21,203
Whereas, you know, all the node and all the everybody else is like, well,

459
00:20:21,213 --> 00:20:24,673
whatever I got today's version, I hope it works, ran smoke tests, you know,

460
00:20:24,761 --> 00:20:25,312
deploy it.

461
00:20:25,802 --> 00:20:28,182
And I think fundamentally this speaks to the difference between, you know,

462
00:20:28,192 --> 00:20:31,021
software changes over time quite rapidly, you know,

463
00:20:31,031 --> 00:20:34,822
compared to say bridge technology or cars and the

464
00:20:34,832 --> 00:20:36,982
more out of sync you are with reality,

465
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,982
the more risk there is.

466
00:20:37,991 --> 00:20:41,942
So you need to build a system to manage that risk or you

467
00:20:41,952 --> 00:20:44,661
have to accept that risk and accepting that risk might look like,

468
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,222
OK, we turn the container on and snap,

469
00:20:46,232 --> 00:20:48,541
ran and sat there for three hours running updates.

470
00:20:48,552 --> 00:20:52,031
That's a bold statement. So talking about

471
00:20:52,261 --> 00:20:53,511
Ubuntu outside of containers.

472
00:20:53,829 --> 00:20:55,189
Where does that fit into that?

473
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:57,380
Well, the reality is if you don't keep your systems up to date,

474
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,310
you're going to diverge,

475
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:00,089
you're going to the delta between you and

476
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:02,880
what the vendor like ubuntu's providing is going to

477
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,569
grow and you're going to have increased risk

478
00:21:04,579 --> 00:21:06,810
of there being a change that breaks stuff.

479
00:21:06,819 --> 00:21:10,829
But according to that attitude, then they're applying automatic updates.

480
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:11,849
-- It's a good thing,
-- right?

481
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:14,810
Again, automatic updates, but with user control,

482
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:18,050
because some users rightfully can make that risk

483
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,869
assessment and make that trade off and say,

484
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,310
look, that's not what you just said.

485
00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:24,439
This machine, for example,

486
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,800
is running an MRI server system and we're keeping it offline because we're,

487
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:29,290
we're going to eat the risk.

488
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,969
You know, a great example always is us submarines. Right.

489
00:21:31,979 --> 00:21:33,750
They go on patrol for, what, 90 days?

490
00:21:33,849 --> 00:21:36,089
They're not getting software updates while they're under the water.

491
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,160
I would hope not communication channels to those

492
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,530
subs as I understand them are quite slow.

493
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,000
You know, the, the, what is it, extremely long

494
00:21:43,114 --> 00:21:43,165
V

495
00:21:43,405 --> 00:21:43,824
or whatever?

496
00:21:43,834 --> 00:21:47,755
VLF, you know, radio transmitters, those miles and miles,

497
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,535
miles long cables buried all over the US to transmit them.

498
00:21:51,244 --> 00:21:53,854
So the thing is again, I go back to that,

499
00:21:53,864 --> 00:21:57,255
make a reasonably safe and sane default that works for people

500
00:21:57,265 --> 00:21:59,025
that don't care and for the people that do care,

501
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:00,324
do let them run with scissors.

502
00:22:00,334 --> 00:22:03,055
But you just said that's not how the modern world works.

503
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:07,750
Some people want to run with scissors and are willing to take that risk and

504
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,140
they should be allowed to.

505
00:22:09,459 --> 00:22:13,060
I mean, I agree. I agree completely. I think forcing

506
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:17,800
anything onto people is dangerous outside of a consumer universe,

507
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:20,290
especially when you don't have to force it.

508
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:23,719
Like a great example is a light bulb, a light bulb can't really have

509
00:22:23,829 --> 00:22:27,900
an interface for me to easily update it or not update it.

510
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:31,430
You know, I, I obviously through the app on my phone or whatever I could do that.

511
00:22:31,709 --> 00:22:35,319
You know, there's going to be a lot of embedded systems running software

512
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,800
where the choice is either

513
00:22:37,109 --> 00:22:38,599
this thing never updates itself

514
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,209
or it updates itself and, you know, you just,

515
00:22:42,219 --> 00:22:46,810
it updates itself in a way that is quote unquote safe that it won't break itself,

516
00:22:46,819 --> 00:22:49,709
it won't reboot and like your lights are off for a minute,

517
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:53,050
you know, or whatever, or like I said, you, you take that risk of, well, look,

518
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,579
this machine is not connected to the internet.

519
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:56,890
It's a light bulb or whatever. I mean, they are connected to the internet now.

520
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:02,270
But what it boils down to for me is there's no good reason to take away the choice.

521
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,604
There, there are good reasons to force a default choice on these people. I

522
00:23:06,415 --> 00:23:09,834
agree with that, but to actually take away that choice,

523
00:23:10,025 --> 00:23:13,834
we short of me really hacking the system up to prevent this.

524
00:23:13,844 --> 00:23:15,505
You know, people on that forum thread are like, oh,

525
00:23:15,515 --> 00:23:17,364
we'll just block DNS access to like what is

526
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:19,454
it like updates to ubuntu.com or stuff like that,

527
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:19,665
right.

528
00:23:19,675 --> 00:23:20,214
And I'm like,

529
00:23:20,614 --> 00:23:25,415
yeah, that's not a solution. Like a solution is there's a flag in a config file.

530
00:23:25,444 --> 00:23:27,864
I mean, you know, not that I'm firewall access to.

531
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:28,359
Well,

532
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:32,300
so one of my complaints always is when people talk about these crazy workarounds,

533
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,329
like black holing some website or something is

534
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:37,619
if for whatever reason

535
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:40,209
that goes away accidentally

536
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,130
at some point now everything explodes.

537
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,540
And speaking of which there's another problem we've ignored.

538
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,359
We kind of assume everybody has good internet.

539
00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:50,459
Like a lot of people don't have high speed internet, like for example,

540
00:23:50,469 --> 00:23:52,449
I go to my parents' cabin, I'm on my cell phone.

541
00:23:52,459 --> 00:23:52,979
Right.

542
00:23:52,989 --> 00:23:57,765
And I don't want emacs updating, you know, pulling down or chrome or, you know,

543
00:23:57,944 --> 00:24:03,405
like Microsoft Office is a great example. That's anywhere from 1 to 2 gigs a month.

544
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,005
It's a chunky boy.

545
00:24:05,214 --> 00:24:08,234
-- I believe that. Actually,
-- that Excel powerpoint

546
00:24:08,244 --> 00:24:08,844
Word.

547
00:24:08,954 --> 00:24:14,074
I mean, every time I run a yum update on my fedora machine, I bet it downloads

548
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:18,464
probably almost a gigabyte of crap. And I do that about every two or three days.

549
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,510
-- Like it's a lot
-- of stuff.

550
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:20,709
Yeah,

551
00:24:20,719 --> 00:24:23,849
like I look at my kids mobile devices and I for a while was keeping track of how

552
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:28,640
much the software updates for their apps are and it averages about 1 to 2 gigs a week,

553
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:29,589
stuff like Minecraft.

554
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:30,900
They've got some big assets in there.

555
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:35,119
Minecraft is huge and well, if you run Steam every time start steam,

556
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,069
it updates itself.

557
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:37,670
And so for example, I mean,

558
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,709
one thing I love is that I think we mentioned this previous show,

559
00:24:39,719 --> 00:24:43,339
but Amazon Prime won't work on a version of chrome that isn't up to date.

560
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:46,349
I think that's somewhat acceptable because by virtue of using

561
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:49,380
something like Netflix or Amazon Prime video to watch video,

562
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:52,050
inherently, you have access to a bunch of bandwidth.

563
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:55,989
That's one of the few situations where a software application or service can say,

564
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,189
look,

565
00:24:56,199 --> 00:24:58,489
I'm pretty sure this person has access to a bunch

566
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,859
of bandwidth all other situations are pretty much good luck.

567
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:02,800
And so that's,

568
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:05,160
that's another concern is somebody takes an ubuntu

569
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,449
machine out to their people live on farms,

570
00:25:07,459 --> 00:25:10,439
people live in rural areas and have, you know, by our standards.

571
00:25:10,449 --> 00:25:11,859
Pretty terrible internet. There's,

572
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:14,829
there's still people in America on dial up, they can't use ubuntu.

573
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:17,952
We need to reframe this completely because you're not wrong.

574
00:25:18,001 --> 00:25:22,151
But it's also easy to get into a weird rathole talking about this.

575
00:25:22,161 --> 00:25:23,631
Here's what it comes down to

576
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:27,881
is the vast majority of people in tech are developing and

577
00:25:27,891 --> 00:25:32,261
testing in an environment that is functionally San Francisco United States.

578
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:34,871
And that's what it is. They have fast internet.

579
00:25:34,881 --> 00:25:37,631
People are relatively dense, they have good cell coverage

580
00:25:37,812 --> 00:25:40,741
and this is no doubt the exact same trap of the people

581
00:25:40,751 --> 00:25:44,854
developing Ubuntu have no idea what happens outside of their bubble.

582
00:25:44,864 --> 00:25:46,284
And so to them, it's fine.

583
00:25:46,293 --> 00:25:47,333
Statistically,

584
00:25:47,343 --> 00:25:49,614
you think the people developing ubuntu don't

585
00:25:49,624 --> 00:25:52,453
have above average computers and internet access.

586
00:25:52,463 --> 00:25:54,244
I would hope they do or they think you don't go

587
00:25:54,254 --> 00:25:57,494
get another freaking job and work someone that treats you well.

588
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,374
Well, exactly. Right.

589
00:25:58,384 --> 00:26:01,963
Like I've actually downgraded now to only having one internet provider.

590
00:26:01,973 --> 00:26:05,654
Like I work from home and traditionally I had two internet providers because, well,

591
00:26:05,663 --> 00:26:07,264
one of them will fail once in a while.

592
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:07,933
Right.

593
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:11,036
And you know, and then I finally did the math on how often they fail and blah, blah,

594
00:26:11,046 --> 00:26:11,156
blah.

595
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:12,995
And I was like, ok, I can ditch this. I don't need it.

596
00:26:13,046 --> 00:26:15,875
You know, I still have by my standards, you know,

597
00:26:15,885 --> 00:26:18,916
relatively slow internet at 100 and 70 megabits symmetrical.

598
00:26:18,926 --> 00:26:21,446
That's not normal that the normal is

599
00:26:21,586 --> 00:26:21,845
like

600
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:23,676
five or 10.

601
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:25,066
Like here's the deal.

602
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:25,296
This is,

603
00:26:25,306 --> 00:26:29,196
this is very true of security as well is we generally

604
00:26:29,206 --> 00:26:34,515
design systems and process for a mythical user that doesn't exist

605
00:26:34,989 --> 00:26:39,750
and we don't live in the real world. We don't see the things normal people see.

606
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,640
And so like the sales guy who opens his Wi

607
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:45,140
Fi hotspot up to allow anyone to connect to it.

608
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:50,140
That's because his job is to make sales not to secure his Wi Fi hotspot.

609
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:53,979
And it's, it's the same thing with this, with the people who designed this system,

610
00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:54,339
no doubt

611
00:26:54,584 --> 00:27:00,224
-- their job is to install updates
-- where their job is to ship updates.

612
00:27:00,234 --> 00:27:03,145
Thus, they think they have inherent value and thus, you know,

613
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:06,035
foisting them on people forcibly is acceptable.

614
00:27:06,045 --> 00:27:07,864
Yeah, that's fair. And I mean, this is

615
00:27:08,275 --> 00:27:08,765
there,

616
00:27:08,775 --> 00:27:13,964
-- there isn't a great answer to this outside of like
-- there is a great answer though.

617
00:27:14,324 --> 00:27:18,854
There's a really great simple answer which is you have a relatively sane default.

618
00:27:18,864 --> 00:27:20,405
That is well documented saying

619
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:24,459
-- look, all of them to has to say is Kurt,
-- they think their default is sane.

620
00:27:24,469 --> 00:27:27,329
-- They don't know it isn't.
-- We make a sane default.

621
00:27:27,339 --> 00:27:30,390
And we also make it clear how you change the behavior to do what you want.

622
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,280
Like for example, you live on crappy internet.

623
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,739
Ok. Turn off, uh you know, automatic updates

624
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:37,180
and then for all we know,

625
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:40,489
you drive into the city and use a coffee shop or somebody brings you out the updates on

626
00:27:40,709 --> 00:27:42,250
another USB key, whatever. I don't care.

627
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,199
But the point is we make it possible for somebody to do

628
00:27:45,209 --> 00:27:47,900
that and if they don't care or don't know to do that,

629
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:50,329
they never have to know or care because the default is

630
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:52,390
it just updates and it's fine and if it bothers them,

631
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:53,500
they can do something.

632
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:57,209
I guarantee you, they think their default is sane. I guarantee it.

633
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,729
And I am ok with that default.

634
00:27:59,739 --> 00:28:03,390
What I'm not ok with is them taking away my ability to change it.

635
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,109
But they think that they, I guarantee you,

636
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:09,750
they think what they've done is normal and expected.

637
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,069
-- I guarantee it. Yeah.
-- And that's a fundamental.

638
00:28:13,339 --> 00:28:15,630
But how, ok. No, no, no. Hang on.

639
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:18,310
How are they going to find out?

640
00:28:18,589 --> 00:28:20,630
They've just made a silly mistake because let's

641
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,319
face it going on a forum and whinging is

642
00:28:23,609 --> 00:28:25,459
no one ever pays attention to those. Right?

643
00:28:25,469 --> 00:28:27,510
You're just a crazy person yelling into the wind.

644
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,969
That forum is quite a long discussion thread.

645
00:28:29,979 --> 00:28:33,550
And Ashley ubuntu did modify their decision slightly if you read down for.

646
00:28:33,709 --> 00:28:35,540
-- I, I
-- didn't make it that far and I'm sure

647
00:28:35,645 --> 00:28:36,265
they did,

648
00:28:36,405 --> 00:28:38,824
-- but
-- that's, well, they modified it a little bit.

649
00:28:38,834 --> 00:28:41,224
But not materially as I understand it.

650
00:28:41,234 --> 00:28:42,204
They basically still,

651
00:28:42,214 --> 00:28:44,954
they give you up to two months now and then forcibly update you.

652
00:28:44,964 --> 00:28:47,665
Well, that's stupid though. That whatever, it doesn't matter,

653
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:49,625
that's still dumb. It.

654
00:28:49,635 --> 00:28:51,135
But for real, like this is,

655
00:28:51,145 --> 00:28:55,224
this is the same challenge security people have is how do we figure out

656
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:58,300
where we find the information we need

657
00:28:58,439 --> 00:29:01,140
you talk to your customers, you talk to your users.

658
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:04,500
I mean, that's easier said than done, of course. But that is the answer. Yes.

659
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:07,650
-- You
-- literally like I've, I've made it very clear, for example,

660
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,140
internally at the CS A where

661
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:12,920
if you people have pain, tell me, come to me, I will help you.

662
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,229
I will try and understand your pain and fix it.

663
00:29:15,239 --> 00:29:17,420
And that's part of the maturity model of, you know,

664
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:20,079
being a security practitioner and rather than just saying no.

665
00:29:20,189 --> 00:29:22,260
Yeah, I, I agree. I agree completely.

666
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:22,420
And,

667
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:27,449
and I think that of all the lessons we can take away from this weird rambly episode

668
00:29:27,729 --> 00:29:28,680
is that

669
00:29:29,229 --> 00:29:30,660
as a professional,

670
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:34,709
it's our job to understand what people are doing with our products, don't guess,

671
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:37,900
don't assume, you know, actually go and find people

672
00:29:38,147 --> 00:29:41,047
and work with them and talk to them and understand what they're doing.

673
00:29:41,167 --> 00:29:44,978
But then most importantly is when someone is sticking a fork in the outlet,

674
00:29:44,988 --> 00:29:46,807
you don't say like you idiot, why would you do that?

675
00:29:46,817 --> 00:29:49,128
You say? All right, why is the person doing this?

676
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:53,027
Because there's clearly some sort of deficient design here going on

677
00:29:53,157 --> 00:29:56,397
and now all the outlets are tamper resistant with little plastic covers.

678
00:29:56,407 --> 00:29:58,858
This is a perfect example of the sticking the fork in the outlet.

679
00:29:58,868 --> 00:30:02,598
The solution is that now, if you've been Home Depot recently,

680
00:30:02,845 --> 00:30:05,465
all the outlets are tamper resistant in the sense of you have to,

681
00:30:05,475 --> 00:30:09,056
you have to jam the large neutral in first to open up the hot.

682
00:30:09,066 --> 00:30:12,745
Otherwise if you try to jam in the hot, it won't open, the plastic won't release.

683
00:30:12,755 --> 00:30:14,026
But the point is

684
00:30:14,286 --> 00:30:17,546
don't just say the users are idiots. They're sticking forks in the outlets.

685
00:30:17,556 --> 00:30:21,645
You need to figure out why are they doing this and how can we maybe make sure they stop,

686
00:30:21,656 --> 00:30:23,015
you know, killing themselves.

687
00:30:23,026 --> 00:30:26,845
And I would say this generalizes more generally to all professional activities.

688
00:30:26,855 --> 00:30:27,245
Of course,

689
00:30:27,514 --> 00:30:30,984
understanding what your users want, what they need,

690
00:30:30,994 --> 00:30:33,043
what they're trying to do because a great

691
00:30:33,053 --> 00:30:35,083
example being is I needed some stumps removed

692
00:30:35,093 --> 00:30:37,583
and my brain just went to OK guy with a back who dig them out.

693
00:30:37,593 --> 00:30:40,534
And then I phoned for a quote and they're like, well, can we just use a stump grinder?

694
00:30:40,543 --> 00:30:43,744
And I'm like, uh yeah, actually, yeah, that's, yeah, he's like,

695
00:30:43,754 --> 00:30:45,313
you don't want them like ripped out,

696
00:30:45,323 --> 00:30:47,193
we can just grind them down and fill the hole in with dirt.

697
00:30:47,203 --> 00:30:50,874
And I'm like, yeah, that's actually what I want. Like what I want is flat dirt

698
00:30:51,104 --> 00:30:51,494
because

699
00:30:52,072 --> 00:30:52,222
oh, I

700
00:30:52,612 --> 00:30:53,192
don't care.

701
00:30:53,202 --> 00:30:58,062
This is another problem we have in tech is you went to someone with a solution,

702
00:30:58,072 --> 00:30:58,982
not with a problem.

703
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:02,491
Yes. Exactly. And the problem is you need the stump removed.

704
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:07,202
The solution is a stump grinder. But you said I want it yanked out with a back

705
00:31:07,401 --> 00:31:10,222
and, but they were smart enough to know that I was, you know, they've encountered,

706
00:31:10,232 --> 00:31:11,732
that's probably every third call.

707
00:31:11,741 --> 00:31:12,582
Right. They're,

708
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:15,842
they're used to dealing with, know it all idiots, right? Like it's fine

709
00:31:16,021 --> 00:31:16,682
but

710
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:21,449
like for real, this is there isn't a good answer to this and there's no,

711
00:31:21,459 --> 00:31:22,640
there's nothing I can tell you.

712
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:25,849
Oh go read this book or go watch this video or whatever

713
00:31:25,969 --> 00:31:29,579
-- that even tells you how to accomplish this. There's
-- try to listen.

714
00:31:29,849 --> 00:31:31,310
Yeah, just don't be in

715
00:31:31,449 --> 00:31:32,270
unemphatic.

716
00:31:32,619 --> 00:31:37,569
-- Like just listen and be nice.
-- Try to listen and ask them why.

717
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:39,719
Yeah, that's fair and focus on problems.

718
00:31:39,729 --> 00:31:42,699
We love to focus on solutions and solutions. Just

719
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,969
usually if you jump to the solution now you have two problems

720
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,530
instead of one.

721
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,199
Anyway, we are out of time. But this has been

722
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:51,560
uh

723
00:31:52,089 --> 00:31:55,020
yeah, I guess good luck with your servers, man. I'm glad I don't run a

724
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,010
Buntu right now,

725
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:56,920
although

726
00:31:57,449 --> 00:32:01,290
it would not shock me if this shows up in Fedora at some point in the near future.

727
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,849
