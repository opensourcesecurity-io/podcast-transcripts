Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,729 --> 00:00:10,979
Kurt Siefried and my partner in promising you that

2
00:00:10,989 --> 00:00:13,819
this podcast will always be available at the URL open

3
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:16,540
source security podcast.com. Josh Pressers.

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,520
I don't promise that at all.

5
00:00:18,659 --> 00:00:21,239
Yeah, but you bought a DNS domain name and put the content there.

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,840
-- So by definition, it has to be there forever.
-- I'm looking does open source security.

7
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,250
Yeah, open source security, podcast.com forwards to open

8
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:28,350
source security dot IO.

9
00:00:28,709 --> 00:00:31,840
-- That was the original UL I think
-- it might have been.

10
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:33,830
No, I think I bought did I,

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,689
I don't remember anymore how we had it because we have the URL S we have is open

12
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,049
source security dot IO. Oh, no, I remember now because we had open

13
00:00:41,169 --> 00:00:43,060
source security podcast.com

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,389
which was hosted on blogger way back in the day

15
00:00:47,819 --> 00:00:51,240
and then blogger did something that like really upset me

16
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:53,159
and I don't even remember what it was now,

17
00:00:53,169 --> 00:00:55,250
but it was so bad that I also own open

18
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:56,169
source security dot IO,

19
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:00,500
which was just like the wordpress site that I basically took the wordpress site,

20
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:05,779
added a podcasting section and then migrated all of the open source security.com

21
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,349
into that site and then just redirected the UR

22
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,349
because I think the Os S podcast.com or there's,

23
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,819
we have, I think Os S

24
00:01:13,309 --> 00:01:16,949
-- Os S podcast.com also forwards to open source Security Ion.
-- I

25
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:20,269
-- did not know that.
-- Yeah, that's our, our shortened URL.

26
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:26,860
Yeah. And this ties into today's show, which is now the Apple people are discovering

27
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,099
that there's a whole bunch of Cocoa pods which is,

28
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,580
it's just a software name space repository for

29
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:35,300
-- chunks of code.
-- It's the package manager

30
00:01:35,309 --> 00:01:35,680
for Cocoa.

31
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:36,150
Yeah,

32
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,500
-- I guess
-- that's it.

33
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,959
They're rediscovering like the rest of us that when you

34
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,290
have a name space like DNS or N PM or PP

35
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:47,300
that when somebody owns that name and provides something there

36
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,120
that essentially

37
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:53,519
people are gonna behave like that's a guaranteed thing forever

38
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,089
that it will be maintained and loved and cherished.

39
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:00,099
-- And,
-- well, I don't think that's a reasonable description of what happened.

40
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,809
It sounds like what happened was

41
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:04,250
they like, disowned

42
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:07,690
all of the packages and owners had to go back and reclaim them,

43
00:02:07,699 --> 00:02:08,839
but a lot of people didn't.

44
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:10,490
-- Yeah,
-- because they,

45
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,089
the, the premise of these name spaces is that the,

46
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,820
when a name is taken by somebody that it will

47
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,744
somehow magically be used in correctly and forever and forever.

48
00:02:18,854 --> 00:02:19,904
But that's not the case.

49
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,654
Well, sure. It's just a package name.

50
00:02:21,664 --> 00:02:24,664
I think calling it a name space is misleading in this context.

51
00:02:25,054 --> 00:02:26,945
But anyway, what happened though?

52
00:02:26,955 --> 00:02:29,304
The Cocoa Pods project,

53
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,835
basically removed ownership of everything for some reason.

54
00:02:31,845 --> 00:02:33,585
I can't remember the details of right now.

55
00:02:33,595 --> 00:02:35,985
It's in the, it's in one of the news stories, then

56
00:02:36,195 --> 00:02:39,445
you had to go reclaim your ownership and obviously they had some sort

57
00:02:39,455 --> 00:02:42,645
of checks for checking emails and things like that to verify you.

58
00:02:42,654 --> 00:02:45,759
-- Are you? Which
-- is good because nobody ever lets their email domain expire.

59
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:46,789
-- Obviously
-- not.

60
00:02:46,929 --> 00:02:47,919
And then

61
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,279
10 years later, some security researchers found out, oh,

62
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:56,440
we can just make an api call that will transfer ownership of unknown things to

63
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,240
us.

64
00:02:57,699 --> 00:02:58,720
Which is

65
00:02:58,929 --> 00:02:59,699
neat.

66
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:00,839
I,

67
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:01,520
I

68
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,720
the thing is, I don't know what to say here because really the, there's,

69
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:07,610
there's no real sort of kind of the only air quote

70
00:03:07,619 --> 00:03:11,029
solution to this problem would be to kind of require again,

71
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,975
sort of active ownership of it like,

72
00:03:13,195 --> 00:03:15,375
but on the other hand, what if it's a mature piece of software?

73
00:03:15,384 --> 00:03:17,615
And it's like, like my favorite example from Ruby,

74
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:21,255
like American date conversion where it converts a date into that goofy month, day,

75
00:03:21,264 --> 00:03:22,455
year American format.

76
00:03:22,464 --> 00:03:25,054
-- And it's done,
-- I mean, but you still want

77
00:03:25,335 --> 00:03:28,705
an owner, you don't want it floating in limbo.

78
00:03:28,714 --> 00:03:32,375
Well, this does raise the issue is I think it

79
00:03:32,535 --> 00:03:35,255
would it be better or worse if it's kind of frozen in time

80
00:03:35,264 --> 00:03:38,445
and nobody can hijack it or if you allow it to be taken over

81
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,160
by some entity because

82
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:45,320
here's the dirt. Like here's one of the truths is validating. Identity

83
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,039
is very difficult.

84
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:47,440
Like I,

85
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:50,009
I run into this all the time people send ad po request of like

86
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,440
I want to delete my email address at the CS A and I'm like,

87
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:52,899
cool.

88
00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:56,279
First you're gonna have to email me from that address because like otherwise,

89
00:03:56,289 --> 00:03:56,449
you know,

90
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,570
you're just some Rando emailing me saying delete this other

91
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,690
email address and we we don't do that right?

92
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,580
And sometimes, but they really say like, look,

93
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:04,910
I don't have access to that email anymore.

94
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,070
Like I don't work at that job,

95
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:10,110
-- blah, blah, blah, whatever, right? I don't
-- know. Does the, does GDPR

96
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,389
-- have like a definition for that particular instance?
-- Yeah. Well, more to the point.

97
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:17,428
Do I want to deal with the GDPR regulator and a possible fine?

98
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,119
No, that's true, I suppose because if you don't believe them,

99
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,279
so the good news is,

100
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:27,429
most of them are pretty like we do verification via their linkedin profile,

101
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,869
which in most cases is like to put it bluntly like

102
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,160
if they're going through this much effort to delete someone else's

103
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,869
email address, uh

104
00:04:35,049 --> 00:04:39,690
-- you know, the CS A and like it's the same name basically, you know.
-- Oh, wow. Ok.

105
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,070
So I just, I just looked and the, the text that showed up,

106
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:46,929
it says the controller should use all reasonable measures to verify the identity,

107
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,489
all reasonable measures.

108
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,600
That's so that, that all the

109
00:04:50,714 --> 00:04:54,454
-- a lot of work
-- not commercially reasonable, just all reasonable. Yeah,

110
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:56,095
all reasonable measures.

111
00:04:56,105 --> 00:04:57,015
-- But yeah,
-- and,

112
00:04:57,024 --> 00:04:59,195
and this actually raises nothing where we had somebody

113
00:04:59,204 --> 00:05:00,815
say I want you to delete my email address.

114
00:05:00,825 --> 00:05:03,714
And I'm like, OK, and they're like, but I just want you to do it this way.

115
00:05:03,725 --> 00:05:07,644
And I'm like, no, like I'm just deleting it. Like this is not,

116
00:05:07,994 --> 00:05:09,695
this is not like a menu.

117
00:05:09,795 --> 00:05:12,885
Like if you say you want me to delete your data, I am deleting your data

118
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,260
gone

119
00:05:14,429 --> 00:05:15,089
because

120
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:19,510
again, from A G like they invoked the GDPR that we weren't timely enough.

121
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,869
And they basically said, hey, you didn't respond quickly enough.

122
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,019
And I'm like you never saw the first email. Like I have no idea.

123
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,690
Like I checked like it's,

124
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:27,779
it's a freaking Google group like it's not

125
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,390
like it must have bounced it or something like it's not, there's,

126
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,149
there's not a lot of places the email could go missing. OK?

127
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,890
-- I don't want to turn this into identity conversation.
-- Yeah. So, but based on all this

128
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,630
identity is very hard,

129
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,309
but identity is only step one. The second step is, is this identity

130
00:05:42,752 --> 00:05:48,183
-- authorized to do this thing? I,
-- I don't think separating those makes sense.

131
00:05:48,312 --> 00:05:51,423
Well, but if you're in a hospital because you get, you know,

132
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:53,083
hit by a car while you're on your bike,

133
00:05:53,092 --> 00:05:55,782
-- that's a thing which is
-- a very real possibility.

134
00:05:55,792 --> 00:06:00,162
-- I ride my bike a lot
-- and I go to a DNS registrar and I'm like, oh man,

135
00:06:00,173 --> 00:06:02,203
like I need to fix our DNS entry.

136
00:06:02,382 --> 00:06:04,173
Can you please give me access to this? Like,

137
00:06:04,352 --> 00:06:04,912
I'm

138
00:06:05,023 --> 00:06:05,463
the Kurt

139
00:06:05,622 --> 00:06:07,953
Siefried Dawn the podcast. Like I should be allowed to do this.

140
00:06:07,963 --> 00:06:10,513
-- They're gonna be like, no, go away. Yeah,
-- they wouldn't let you do that.

141
00:06:11,316 --> 00:06:12,415
I, I get that

142
00:06:13,536 --> 00:06:13,855
right.

143
00:06:14,075 --> 00:06:15,716
And so with these packages,

144
00:06:15,946 --> 00:06:17,895
like the community can't, the,

145
00:06:18,235 --> 00:06:18,536
like,

146
00:06:18,675 --> 00:06:22,936
like I'm waiting on pp to validate our organization's profile, blah, blah, blah.

147
00:06:22,946 --> 00:06:23,186
And

148
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:24,936
it's probably not going to happen for months.

149
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,135
And that's ok because you know what,

150
00:06:26,145 --> 00:06:29,135
it's a volunteer led organization that I'm not even paying a penny

151
00:06:29,365 --> 00:06:31,355
and for me to expect service from them

152
00:06:31,476 --> 00:06:34,776
in a reasonable time. Well, no, too bad. That's not how this works.

153
00:06:34,805 --> 00:06:38,855
I, I think we should just tie in the second story

154
00:06:39,196 --> 00:06:40,096
right away

155
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:45,750
and this is titled The Expense of Unprotected free software.

156
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:50,320
It's high time F Os S Maintainers got a bit of appreciation

157
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,929
by Paul Henning

158
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:52,619
Kamp

159
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,769
and this one was sent to me by our dear friend Toma De Pierre.

160
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,250
And I'm like, you need to put this on Mastodon.

161
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,859
So like I can, I want, I want to re to you because you get the credit here.

162
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,779
But basically what this kind of comes down to is

163
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,480
just pointing out the fact that like open source is

164
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:13,339
really underfunded and under everything right

165
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,812
now and these maintainers are average

166
00:07:15,213 --> 00:07:15,923
pressure.

167
00:07:16,273 --> 00:07:17,403
See, OK,

168
00:07:17,412 --> 00:07:18,833
this actually raises another thing I've been thinking

169
00:07:18,842 --> 00:07:20,863
about a lot you say it's underfunded.

170
00:07:20,953 --> 00:07:23,523
I think that's the wrong word to use because

171
00:07:23,683 --> 00:07:27,162
saying it's underfunded somehow implies that it has

172
00:07:27,173 --> 00:07:30,483
some degree of funding which technically it does.

173
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:33,233
But for example, somebody was talking about how

174
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,953
you can't really call it an open source supply.

175
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:39,365
It's, it's a community resource that is being like strip

176
00:07:39,496 --> 00:07:42,446
-- mind.
-- I'm comfortable with the word underfunded.

177
00:07:42,566 --> 00:07:43,656
I think that's fine.

178
00:07:43,765 --> 00:07:44,376
I don't

179
00:07:44,485 --> 00:07:46,906
like it because to me it implies that

180
00:07:47,276 --> 00:07:51,865
-- funding it properly is a possibility which it is not.
-- I think

181
00:07:52,036 --> 00:07:54,895
it should be, I don't think you should say it's not.

182
00:07:54,996 --> 00:07:57,205
I think there's a lot of things

183
00:07:58,029 --> 00:08:02,000
that need to be come to grips with in the open source world.

184
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:05,720
And basically the point is though ignoring the the fine details like

185
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:09,100
this, this post kind of ends with like

186
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:12,470
what what happens now, right, where we've got this,

187
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,690
all this basically technical debt that's piled up for for forever.

188
00:08:16,989 --> 00:08:21,954
And this actually ties in with the open ssh episode where we were talking about like

189
00:08:22,114 --> 00:08:25,954
just the size and growth of everything is ridiculous and out of control.

190
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,875
And that's like part of open source.

191
00:08:27,885 --> 00:08:31,635
And so this like this, both of these stories, it was wild because I read them.

192
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:36,395
I'm like, oh my goodness, this like these are, they are the same problem.

193
00:08:36,405 --> 00:08:39,955
-- Both of these
-- I finally, I think come to terms with

194
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:44,239
basically two sentences that describe why I find this problem.

195
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,330
So intractable to even think about, let alone find a solution for

196
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,140
which basically boils back to. We can't make people work for us for free.

197
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,010
That's slavery.

198
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,280
Yes. Right. People can choose to work for free.

199
00:08:55,289 --> 00:08:57,270
Like if I choose to pick up a piece of trash

200
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,789
on the side of the road and put in the garbage.

201
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,090
Cool. Thank you. You know,

202
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:04,409
if an open source developer chooses to write a really nice library that does

203
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,760
XY or Z and make it available under some license that I like.

204
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,510
Fantastic, lovely.

205
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,340
But then the other flip side of that is that looking at how do we fix?

206
00:09:14,349 --> 00:09:16,289
Because you and I tend to focus on security,

207
00:09:16,609 --> 00:09:17,770
but it's not just security bugs,

208
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,989
but there's other real like YTD LP. Right.

209
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:24,570
Again, the youtube ID format changes, Y TT LP breaks.

210
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,000
Everybody's like I want an updated package that fixes this

211
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:30,020
and the developers are like, well, the code is fixed, it's this two line fix,

212
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,309
but we're not doing a release until we fix our C I CD and it dragged on for a year.

213
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,869
Maybe it still is. I don't know anymore.

214
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:37,270
But economically speaking,

215
00:09:37,469 --> 00:09:39,340
the only kind of really

216
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:46,809
reasonably efficient and sane way to fix this is to make the maintainers do it. So uh

217
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,580
-- Yeah.
-- No, no, no, no. OK.

218
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,169
I, I think this is a bunch of pieces and I don't think saying, oh,

219
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:53,299
make the maintainers do it.

220
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:54,520
That's the easy.

221
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:56,330
No, no, no, I'm not saying that I'm saying,

222
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,309
I don't see any other reasonable solution to that.

223
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,659
No, no, I, I understand. I understand.

224
00:10:01,789 --> 00:10:02,299
But that's,

225
00:10:02,864 --> 00:10:05,695
I'm not saying that's the solution because the problem is that I'm saying, well,

226
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,705
yay slavery, which I don't like.

227
00:10:07,715 --> 00:10:12,065
Well, it's a solution but yes, it is and not ideal solution.

228
00:10:12,075 --> 00:10:14,255
I think from a security perspective,

229
00:10:14,265 --> 00:10:18,145
especially risk is that thing we always talk about, right?

230
00:10:18,164 --> 00:10:22,424
And when we use open source, we are today

231
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:25,284
pushing the risk onto the project.

232
00:10:25,294 --> 00:10:26,924
For the most part, I know people are like, oh,

233
00:10:26,934 --> 00:10:29,304
you have to analyze your open source and you have to

234
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,010
understand what you're running and all this, but no one does that

235
00:10:32,239 --> 00:10:36,419
they're pushing all that risk upstream and they're being like YOLO open

236
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,409
-- source. Thanks for playing
-- well.

237
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:40,250
I'm going to interrupt yours because they don't have a choice.

238
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:44,369
They can't write a web library, they can't write a PDF parser.

239
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,719
I don't think that's the right way to look at it again.

240
00:10:46,989 --> 00:10:47,010
I

241
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,340
think you're, we're, we're pushing too much upstream.

242
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:53,489
If I decide to use an open source library,

243
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,669
what am I doing to have reasonable

244
00:10:56,679 --> 00:11:00,289
expectations around the maintenance and supply and,

245
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:02,960
and just the overall risk that comes with it.

246
00:11:02,969 --> 00:11:04,280
Right? For the most part,

247
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,809
I am doing nothing. I'm doing no due diligence because I can't,

248
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,609
I don't know who's writing it because I can't,

249
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:14,210
I'm not paying attention to security vulnerabilities because I can't.

250
00:11:14,599 --> 00:11:14,830
Yeah.

251
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,450
So I'm just taking free stuff and I'm using it and

252
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,309
hoping everything works out and for the most part it does.

253
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,359
Well, I mean, because an example is the open ssh vulnerability.

254
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,969
If open SSH upstream doesn't fix it,

255
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,530
the economic cost of having a million people patch their

256
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:32,510
own instances of open SSH and build their own packages.

257
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,070
Number one, let's ignore the fact that most of them can't,

258
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,729
they technically lack like

259
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,700
I'm sorry, but as easy as building an R PM is

260
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:45,969
-- like, I bet less than 1% of technical people can do it.
-- Oh man, it's

261
00:11:46,729 --> 00:11:48,659
adding a patch to an R PM

262
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,739
is harder than it should be.

263
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,400
-- That is what I will say
-- or ad package or whatever, any package, they're all

264
00:11:55,409 --> 00:11:55,929
the same.

265
00:11:55,979 --> 00:11:56,000
Yeah.

266
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:56,539
Yeah.

267
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,280
Right.

268
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:57,969
Like,

269
00:11:58,429 --> 00:11:59,219
because I've done it. You

270
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,169
Yeah, we worked a red hat.

271
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:04,770
That's I literally took ownership of a package to buff my resume when I went to

272
00:12:05,619 --> 00:12:05,640
for

273
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:05,929
hat.

274
00:12:06,049 --> 00:12:06,090
Yeah.

275
00:12:06,099 --> 00:12:06,489
Well,

276
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,409
I also needed that silly open HPHP open ID thing of a jigger

277
00:12:10,419 --> 00:12:11,799
-- to work
-- got you

278
00:12:11,888 --> 00:12:13,997
because it literally needed like this one patch.

279
00:12:14,007 --> 00:12:15,437
So it would actually work

280
00:12:15,547 --> 00:12:18,168
and the maintainer hadn't touched it in like four years.

281
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:21,107
I have built and released thousands of

282
00:12:21,478 --> 00:12:24,067
RP MS for security updates

283
00:12:24,197 --> 00:12:26,658
and you've probably done Open SSH even I,

284
00:12:26,668 --> 00:12:29,627
so I have many stories about Open SSH actually.

285
00:12:29,638 --> 00:12:30,867
-- But
-- let me put it this way.

286
00:12:30,877 --> 00:12:34,507
Do you want a world where every company using open SSH builds, their,

287
00:12:34,518 --> 00:12:36,187
not even builds their own package.

288
00:12:36,197 --> 00:12:37,088
Let's not even go there.

289
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,755
Just say they download the source R PM or the source D package or the source,

290
00:12:40,765 --> 00:12:42,515
whatever thing for their distro,

291
00:12:42,645 --> 00:12:45,156
add this one little patch and rebuild it.

292
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,955
I do not want to live in that world because it would be a disaster.

293
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:51,395
I don't think that's a so, so here's one of my

294
00:12:51,565 --> 00:12:52,486
complaints.

295
00:12:52,536 --> 00:12:55,625
But what I'm saying is economically the only sane way for

296
00:12:55,635 --> 00:12:59,156
this to happen is for as centralized an effort as possible,

297
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:02,755
which in this case means the open sh developers ship a good patch that we

298
00:13:02,864 --> 00:13:05,924
know we can trust reasonably well and then all the distro consume

299
00:13:05,934 --> 00:13:09,164
it and roll updates and roll packages that we did update.

300
00:13:09,174 --> 00:13:11,403
That's economically the only thing that makes sense.

301
00:13:11,573 --> 00:13:14,484
I don't think this is a valid comparison though

302
00:13:14,874 --> 00:13:19,523
because open SSH is special. A lot of. So here's, I think here's the thing

303
00:13:19,934 --> 00:13:25,684
that I'm, I'm having a thought as I speak, there's kind of two worlds of open source.

304
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:28,254
There's things like open SSH in the Linux current

305
00:13:28,521 --> 00:13:29,091
and

306
00:13:29,202 --> 00:13:33,171
we'll say well maintained, open source. OK?

307
00:13:33,182 --> 00:13:35,682
We're like, we don't worry about open SSH,

308
00:13:35,692 --> 00:13:40,221
not releasing updates like that's just that is expected and it is going to happen.

309
00:13:40,231 --> 00:13:44,461
It is a properly resourced project. Now. It, it certainly could use more money.

310
00:13:44,471 --> 00:13:45,611
I'm certain of that. Right.

311
00:13:45,622 --> 00:13:47,052
Linux kernel, same idea,

312
00:13:47,101 --> 00:13:52,932
they have resources but and that is not comparable to an open source project that is

313
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:53,721
a guy

314
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,900
or a lady or whoever in their basement,

315
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:00,260
that is not a comparable comparison,

316
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,460
comparable comparison is that whatever it's worked out.

317
00:14:02,469 --> 00:14:05,340
And so I think this gets this, this creates

318
00:14:05,489 --> 00:14:08,099
this difficult talking point

319
00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:09,099
of

320
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:10,309
like saying, oh,

321
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,090
you have to rebuild open SSH and that's really hard to do and it is hard to do.

322
00:14:14,099 --> 00:14:16,469
I'm not saying it isn't versus

323
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:19,210
I'm using a cocoa pod

324
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,750
from a website

325
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:26,700
that does a thing and maybe I could replace the thing. Maybe I couldn't, I don't know.

326
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,530
-- But you know what I mean? Those feel very different to me.
-- OK.

327
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:33,049
Similar example, let's say

328
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:34,330
we need a, a

329
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,059
widely used Python package

330
00:14:37,729 --> 00:14:40,140
for people to roll their own update and deploy it locally.

331
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:43,460
Less than 1% of technical people would be able to figure it out

332
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:44,890
just how would they even know

333
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:48,390
exactly. And this is what I'm saying. So from an economic perspective,

334
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:50,940
I keep coming back to the only sort of

335
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,109
economically rational way to do this is a centralized and

336
00:14:54,234 --> 00:14:57,255
upstream as possible. And then I get back to my counter.

337
00:14:57,265 --> 00:14:59,044
I like, but I'm not in favor of slavery.

338
00:14:59,054 --> 00:15:03,905
So I don't know like, how do we do this if the developer says no or no, thank you or

339
00:15:04,085 --> 00:15:04,674
you know,

340
00:15:04,994 --> 00:15:07,455
or is on vacation because God forbid this

341
00:15:07,465 --> 00:15:10,604
person maintaining some critical piece of the internet,

342
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:15,090
but well, not even the internet, that something that all of society depends on.

343
00:15:15,099 --> 00:15:16,950
Right. I'm always reminded of XML hash offs

344
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,989
where the guy is like, yeah, I can work on it in three months.

345
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,780
Like I have other, I have my life and we're like, ok, well,

346
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:23,940
we'll do the work because we need this now.

347
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:27,200
-- And, but that happens very rarely
-- in that instance,

348
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,859
that was also a literal redhead employee

349
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,940
offering to help with the thing And we just saw XZ,

350
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,419
which was a very similar situation

351
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:38,729
but a less than ideal outcome

352
00:15:39,312 --> 00:15:41,153
and, and that's the thing, right?

353
00:15:41,163 --> 00:15:44,653
-- So that I suspect
-- these stories though are way more common than we think we're,

354
00:15:44,663 --> 00:15:46,143
but we're only seeing it when they like,

355
00:15:46,182 --> 00:15:49,893
basically mark their repo is archived or read only.

356
00:15:49,973 --> 00:15:52,973
But I'm guessing that there are hundreds or thousands of

357
00:15:53,182 --> 00:15:56,163
bugs, even security bugs, performance bugs, whatever bugs,

358
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:58,093
bugs that people really, really want fixed

359
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:01,393
and developer like, yeah. No, I can't or I won't or I don't want to or whatever.

360
00:16:01,403 --> 00:16:04,453
-- And it's like now, now what?
-- Well, and look, that's

361
00:16:04,732 --> 00:16:07,213
the question and that's the thing,

362
00:16:07,536 --> 00:16:10,976
I think as consumers of open source where the relationship is broken

363
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:15,096
because there are consumers of open source that will try to give

364
00:16:15,106 --> 00:16:18,325
them money or go try to work with someone like tide lift

365
00:16:18,495 --> 00:16:19,125
or,

366
00:16:19,385 --> 00:16:22,125
you know, maybe go talk to the Sovereign Tech Fund or, or,

367
00:16:22,135 --> 00:16:24,385
-- or whatever and they'll
-- have a employee spend

368
00:16:24,395 --> 00:16:27,166
half their time working on upstream for sure.

369
00:16:27,255 --> 00:16:27,755
Yes.

370
00:16:27,906 --> 00:16:30,195
And, and I, I mean, I remember when I was at Elastic,

371
00:16:30,205 --> 00:16:33,245
we would do that where if there was a library we needed a thing

372
00:16:33,546 --> 00:16:35,245
and for whatever reason

373
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:39,890
it wasn't getting done, we would get it done. Right. We would go and help.

374
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,369
And of course, again, coming from somewhere like elastic,

375
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,809
coming from somewhere like red hat.

376
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:48,169
I think it was easier to have that conversation though. Right. If, if Kurt

377
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:51,309
siefried shows up at a random project, people are gonna be like,

378
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,710
who the heck is this guy?

379
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,289
Well, or a Fortune 500 A to get the funding and resourcing.

380
00:16:56,299 --> 00:16:59,775
But b yeah, like some Randall from a Fortune Five 100 shows up. Good luck.

381
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:01,864
I might be more perceptive to

382
00:17:02,265 --> 00:17:05,723
an email address from a Fortune 500 than from

383
00:17:06,094 --> 00:17:10,324
-- a Rando.
-- What about an, a large cloud provider that's known to take open

384
00:17:10,444 --> 00:17:11,824
source and modifies it?

385
00:17:12,045 --> 00:17:13,723
-- Well, I mean,
-- look even that. So

386
00:17:14,223 --> 00:17:14,814
that's funny.

387
00:17:14,824 --> 00:17:17,905
I mean, I know like we've crapped on Amazon a lot for their, well,

388
00:17:17,915 --> 00:17:19,125
all the cloud providers do it.

389
00:17:19,214 --> 00:17:21,005
Yeah, I mean, Google and everyone

390
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,310
and we've given them a hard time more than once.

391
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:26,670
And I was actually thinking about that specifically in the context of this,

392
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,040
this Paul Henning comp.

393
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:30,670
Um Ph I'm gonna call him phk for the rest of the show,

394
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,670
but I was thinking about that specifically, like in this context

395
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:37,300
and I think if you look at the big open source projects.

396
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:41,800
It's easy to say they've done a bunch of strip, big old big cloud providers,

397
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,829
not big old projects.

398
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:46,130
It's easy to say they, they strip minded open source and to a degree they have,

399
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,310
but it was often

400
00:17:48,069 --> 00:17:50,089
some sort of like corporate

401
00:17:50,349 --> 00:17:53,520
open core open source thing. Like you had, you know, Reddi

402
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:53,849
and

403
00:17:53,979 --> 00:17:56,170
Mango and Elastic search and these sort of things.

404
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:01,209
Hashy Corp is another one, those are the things that they've kind of taken

405
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:06,140
and twisted versus like random small packages, right?

406
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,099
And they're using them and they probably

407
00:18:08,109 --> 00:18:09,989
aren't contributing back in any meaningful way.

408
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,410
But I feel like again,

409
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:13,449
we have this like dual

410
00:18:13,699 --> 00:18:15,329
conversation of,

411
00:18:15,349 --> 00:18:19,979
I've got this basically resource project that's being taken and used versus

412
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,209
I have a open source project that's one person

413
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:24,890
and I'm taking it and using it.

414
00:18:25,219 --> 00:18:27,449
And again, to go back to economics. A

415
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:30,260
the licenses specifically allow the cloud providers to

416
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,479
go and grab the stuff and use it for

417
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,979
our contributor nickel back and B that has resulted

418
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,079
in one of the biggest transformations of it.

419
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:38,209
And one of the biggest,

420
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:38,910
like

421
00:18:39,589 --> 00:18:44,949
the fact that you can now stand up a website with email and with everything for

422
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:46,859
like six bucks a month and just have

423
00:18:46,869 --> 00:18:49,989
it work or deploy some custom application for like

424
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,359
10 bucks a month.

425
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,380
Like

426
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,439
everybody, I, I mean, as much as people hate on cloud,

427
00:18:55,449 --> 00:19:00,040
I dare anybody to build an email server from scratch and I mean, by scratch, I mean,

428
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,219
go by the parts of like, best Buy or whatever,

429
00:19:02,229 --> 00:19:04,819
figure out how to get an IP and route it and like, you know what I mean?

430
00:19:04,829 --> 00:19:07,780
Because you and I have done that and it's horrible. I don't ever want to do that again.

431
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:10,939
I want to read a paragraph from this paper

432
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:11,739
by

433
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,339
what I say. Phkphk. I got that right.

434
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,719
That I think

435
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:18,329
it, it, it captures a lot of this

436
00:19:18,662 --> 00:19:19,422
very well.

437
00:19:19,432 --> 00:19:22,892
It says over the past couple of decades, our world has certainly transformed to

438
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,572
the point where washing machines no longer can

439
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,402
start without a connection to the internet.

440
00:19:27,412 --> 00:19:32,652
We've reached that point by drawing on an almost unlimited credit line extended by f

441
00:19:32,983 --> 00:19:37,042
volunteers like Lassie, which is the, the XZ maintainer.

442
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,203
In many cases,

443
00:19:38,213 --> 00:19:40,123
these folks have been more than happy to

444
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:43,422
forgive that debt along with the compounded interest,

445
00:19:43,802 --> 00:19:44,802
but that simply matters

446
00:19:45,076 --> 00:19:48,345
the problem until these generous souls finally lose interest,

447
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,406
retire or simply die off

448
00:19:50,735 --> 00:19:53,105
that, that should scare you to death.

449
00:19:53,115 --> 00:19:56,985
That paragraph should send chills down your spine.

450
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,066
Well, that's the thing.

451
00:19:58,076 --> 00:20:00,936
Like I've noticed a lot of open source projects and efforts that

452
00:20:00,946 --> 00:20:04,666
the average age of the maintainers is increasing by one every year.

453
00:20:04,676 --> 00:20:07,666
Yes. Right. Like where's the, like,

454
00:20:07,936 --> 00:20:11,186
like I get that there's new people coming in. But by and large

455
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,540
part of it too speaks to like,

456
00:20:13,699 --> 00:20:14,540
because, well,

457
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:18,739
we just I just did another round of stf um evaluations for these projects.

458
00:20:18,829 --> 00:20:19,780
And one of the

459
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:23,239
common patterns we're seeing now with some of these projects

460
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:26,380
is that they're basically not messaging it the best way.

461
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,239
But they're basically saying, look like we're the experts.

462
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,959
We're the only two or three people who can do this work and upgrade the software.

463
00:20:30,969 --> 00:20:36,060
So we want money to pay us to do this and it's in some cases, the software is highly,

464
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:36,579
highly

465
00:20:37,045 --> 00:20:40,135
like one was a Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulation suite

466
00:20:40,354 --> 00:20:42,564
which yeah, like it's,

467
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:44,805
you're not gonna have like a bunch of random people show up

468
00:20:44,814 --> 00:20:47,364
and actually be able to help with what they want to fix,

469
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,464
which is the the transfer of heat through um uh

470
00:20:50,635 --> 00:20:52,204
transparent materials, right?

471
00:20:52,214 --> 00:20:55,614
You as an engineer probably know that that's mildly complicated to, to model.

472
00:20:56,555 --> 00:21:00,114
And so it is kind of like it's a rock and a hard place of like where we want, we,

473
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,974
we like the STF doesn't want to just pay

474
00:21:02,089 --> 00:21:03,140
people to write software.

475
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:06,630
They actually want more, have a, a more of an impact with community funding

476
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:10,280
and you know, maybe improving governance and growing the community and all that,

477
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:10,569
right?

478
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:13,689
Because, and some of the projects very explicitly had as part of their funding,

479
00:21:13,699 --> 00:21:15,709
like we want to have 100 hours to

480
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:17,839
spend on improving governance and growing the project.

481
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:20,109
And it's like, OK, good because that's sustainable, that's

482
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:21,089
long term.

483
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,530
But like there is the flip side of like there's

484
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:27,219
a lot of open source software that is real technical.

485
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,074
Well, here's, here's a great example.

486
00:21:29,175 --> 00:21:33,265
So did you read the story about the PC RE two maintainer?

487
00:21:33,515 --> 00:21:36,405
This is a couple of weeks ago, I'll put, I'll put a link in the show notes. Um

488
00:21:36,675 --> 00:21:38,275
I know enough about PC RE to know that I

489
00:21:38,285 --> 00:21:41,395
would never even attempt to think about modifying that code.

490
00:21:42,005 --> 00:21:46,234
Well, so here's the deal with PC RE two is the

491
00:21:46,385 --> 00:21:51,594
-- OK. So for what is PC RE
-- Pearl compatible regular expressions, right?

492
00:21:51,604 --> 00:21:52,555
It's a regular expression.

493
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,739
Regular expressions are hideously complicated.

494
00:21:55,949 --> 00:21:58,280
There's a famous saying that if you solve a problem with

495
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:02,400
-- Red Jacks, now you have two problems.
-- I agree with that 100%.

496
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:06,239
And because every time I've used regular expressions, I'm like, oh, it works

497
00:22:06,449 --> 00:22:07,599
and then when it doesn't work,

498
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:11,400
it's because it's like some insane corner case that takes you a week to figure out.

499
00:22:11,609 --> 00:22:14,640
But here's the thing, the guy who maintains that package,

500
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,760
he just turned 80 years old

501
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,805
and he created an issue on github. That's basically like

502
00:22:20,295 --> 00:22:24,925
he titled it long term Maintenance of PC Re two with basically saying like, what,

503
00:22:24,935 --> 00:22:26,444
what is, what are we going to do?

504
00:22:26,675 --> 00:22:30,844
This is like straight up like Japan has their idea of living masters where, you know,

505
00:22:30,854 --> 00:22:34,625
they some guy's awesome at pottery or making swords or whatever.

506
00:22:34,765 --> 00:22:35,204
And

507
00:22:35,364 --> 00:22:37,675
the government actually has programs to try and you know,

508
00:22:37,685 --> 00:22:40,324
get them an apprentice to keep these skills alive because,

509
00:22:41,265 --> 00:22:42,385
yeah, like when those,

510
00:22:42,545 --> 00:22:43,204
that one,

511
00:22:43,505 --> 00:22:44,005
like

512
00:22:44,344 --> 00:22:47,005
nobody on the planet knows more about PC re too than that guy.

513
00:22:47,589 --> 00:22:50,890
And it would be nice if he had an apprentice to, like, mind dump into.

514
00:22:50,939 --> 00:22:57,130
-- But,
-- I mean, my suspicion is he's not sustaining his life on PC RE two either.

515
00:22:57,439 --> 00:22:57,859
No,

516
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:02,760
but he's also statistically not gonna be with us for forever.

517
00:23:02,935 --> 00:23:03,824
-- right?
-- You know.

518
00:23:03,895 --> 00:23:04,244
Yes.

519
00:23:04,765 --> 00:23:09,474
And that's the thing that always gets me is like for a people worry about projects,

520
00:23:09,484 --> 00:23:11,104
not having enough developers.

521
00:23:11,114 --> 00:23:11,574
And

522
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:14,755
we're also starting to maybe realize even worse than like

523
00:23:14,765 --> 00:23:17,314
much more complicated and difficult than that is like,

524
00:23:17,324 --> 00:23:18,354
does this project,

525
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:20,425
can it outlive its

526
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,290
benevolent dictator for life if they die and

527
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,280
not many projects I suspect would survive that?

528
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:29,719
Ok. So, so let's let's move on

529
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,449
to the like, maybe

530
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:32,280
it, it's funny,

531
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:35,920
we actually talked almost exclusively about this and I think Cocoa pods is, is,

532
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:38,390
well, it's, it's similar, I think it's part of the story, right?

533
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,060
So here's the thing I've been thinking about putting all of these pieces together,

534
00:23:41,069 --> 00:23:44,959
you know, like PC re two Cocoa pods, the PHK story,

535
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:48,390
kind of just I've been spending more time than you can imagine.

536
00:23:48,401 --> 00:23:51,181
Like, like building these scenarios in my mind.

537
00:23:51,191 --> 00:23:53,801
What struck the middle with Cocoa pods is like if a nation state

538
00:23:53,811 --> 00:23:57,140
agency paid to get about five or 10 of those cocoa pods,

539
00:23:57,151 --> 00:23:57,571
you know,

540
00:23:57,911 --> 00:23:59,740
updated and maintained by them.

541
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,020
Then at some point in the future,

542
00:24:01,031 --> 00:24:05,301
they could very easily slip a back door in that ends up in like mobile apps on.

543
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,821
Yes, that's it. Like not a percentage

544
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,901
like on the mobile apps in that ecosystem.

545
00:24:10,911 --> 00:24:14,980
-- It's,
-- it's objective c right, objective C is like the Apple Development eco

546
00:24:15,141 --> 00:24:17,641
system. So you'd get like iphone

547
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:20,241
and, and OS X stuff.

548
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:23,001
I'm guessing if you basically got five or 10

549
00:24:23,011 --> 00:24:26,602
well positioned packages you could basically get on every

550
00:24:27,352 --> 00:24:29,312
-- place on the planet
-- for sure, for sure. OK.

551
00:24:29,322 --> 00:24:31,362
Anyway, all right, all this stuff put together, right?

552
00:24:31,712 --> 00:24:31,791
Yeah,

553
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:33,521
I feel like

554
00:24:33,822 --> 00:24:35,602
we are reaching a point

555
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:39,222
in all of open source and everything we're seeing

556
00:24:39,232 --> 00:24:42,062
and these developers are getting burnt out and angry and

557
00:24:42,203 --> 00:24:42,993
frustrated.

558
00:24:43,172 --> 00:24:46,542
I I'm not saying they should sabotage their projects.

559
00:24:46,733 --> 00:24:49,383
But I think like if you're fed up and sick and tired,

560
00:24:49,733 --> 00:24:50,223
we,

561
00:24:50,233 --> 00:24:52,963
you need to be able to step away and not feel like crushing

562
00:24:52,973 --> 00:24:57,463
guilt that somehow you're letting society down because the problem is if you,

563
00:24:57,623 --> 00:24:59,463
let's say archive your repo,

564
00:24:59,733 --> 00:25:00,152
there's good.

565
00:25:00,162 --> 00:25:04,012
I mean, you saw it when, when the guy for the what the node IP project,

566
00:25:04,022 --> 00:25:05,932
archive your repo and there were all these news

567
00:25:05,942 --> 00:25:07,743
stories about how terrible it was this guy.

568
00:25:07,753 --> 00:25:08,473
No, like

569
00:25:08,593 --> 00:25:09,113
the guy

570
00:25:09,264 --> 00:25:12,624
he needed a break, cut him some slack. It's not his problem.

571
00:25:12,734 --> 00:25:13,264
I still love

572
00:25:13,463 --> 00:25:15,144
cried.org with 20 year old content.

573
00:25:15,154 --> 00:25:18,833
On it because people keep coming to it and reading it and I occasionally

574
00:25:18,843 --> 00:25:21,843
get an email about it and I've seriously thought about just turning it off.

575
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,323
People would probably complain.

576
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:27,323
I think when you create something like an open source project,

577
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:30,624
when you're working on any community, anything,

578
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:36,063
I think you end up in a place where you feel like you have to do something. Right.

579
00:25:36,073 --> 00:25:41,025
Because, you know, there's people who are counting on the work you do, right?

580
00:25:41,035 --> 00:25:42,805
And I mean, I've, I see this, there's,

581
00:25:42,814 --> 00:25:46,484
there's some open source stuff I work on like at the open ssf that it's like if I, if,

582
00:25:46,494 --> 00:25:48,354
if I don't do it, it's not going to get done.

583
00:25:48,364 --> 00:25:49,974
And I know people need this to be done,

584
00:25:50,214 --> 00:25:50,515
right?

585
00:25:50,525 --> 00:25:52,405
-- And so there's this like
-- they need to be done so much

586
00:25:52,415 --> 00:25:54,305
so that they'll rely on you to do it for free.

587
00:25:54,584 --> 00:25:54,645
That's

588
00:25:54,785 --> 00:25:54,824
just,

589
00:25:55,025 --> 00:25:55,114
it's

590
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:57,864
like Belling the cat, everybody agrees. We should bell the cat.

591
00:25:57,875 --> 00:26:00,854
But like, ok, is anybody gonna buy us a bell or even?

592
00:26:00,994 --> 00:26:03,015
-- Well,
-- and that's just it. Right. And I think

593
00:26:03,385 --> 00:26:04,166
there are, and I'm not,

594
00:26:04,176 --> 00:26:08,406
I'm not saying these are bad people or bad companies or anything like that, but they,

595
00:26:08,515 --> 00:26:10,326
they've created this like

596
00:26:10,586 --> 00:26:11,916
sense of,

597
00:26:12,115 --> 00:26:13,485
of purpose.

598
00:26:13,495 --> 00:26:13,965
I don, I don't know,

599
00:26:13,975 --> 00:26:16,135
I don't know what else to call it for these open

600
00:26:16,145 --> 00:26:19,206
source projects for these users and they're giving them guilt.

601
00:26:19,215 --> 00:26:22,845
Right. You know what this reminds me of entirely is the whole recycling.

602
00:26:22,855 --> 00:26:26,026
It's your job to recycle and that will save the planet. It's part of

603
00:26:27,255 --> 00:26:27,355
it's

604
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,635
no, it's you

605
00:26:28,855 --> 00:26:30,326
and your plastic straws.

606
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:31,656
That is the problem.

607
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:34,286
Not a Fortune 500 with actual resources

608
00:26:34,296 --> 00:26:36,177
that can change your manufacturing process.

609
00:26:36,187 --> 00:26:39,177
It's you, it's your job to recycle. And as we're all discovering

610
00:26:39,506 --> 00:26:42,136
like something like upwards of 80% of recycling ends up in

611
00:26:42,146 --> 00:26:44,786
landfill in North America because there's no market for it.

612
00:26:46,067 --> 00:26:46,526
You know,

613
00:26:46,697 --> 00:26:50,107
like I recycle and I feel so ridiculous doing it because I,

614
00:26:50,116 --> 00:26:52,817
I know the numbers like here in Edmonton and everything.

615
00:26:53,357 --> 00:26:57,347
But I feel that if I don't, right, like that's the thing like they poisoned us.

616
00:26:57,709 --> 00:26:58,260
Yeah.

617
00:26:58,609 --> 00:27:02,109
And I think part of this kind of I'm gonna say this quote

618
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:04,199
because I think it kind of applies here in a sideways way.

619
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:07,280
The markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.

620
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:10,760
And I think that's kind of what's happening here is I think a lot of these people

621
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,969
are scared because they realize they've given all this

622
00:27:12,979 --> 00:27:15,430
power to the open source community because like,

623
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:17,250
they're running open source, like they can't, you,

624
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,199
you can't replace the Linux kernel.

625
00:27:19,569 --> 00:27:20,329
No, like

626
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:21,680
if no,

627
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:21,859
I

628
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:25,479
mean, in theory, you could maybe switch to free BS D,

629
00:27:25,489 --> 00:27:27,880
maybe that's like kind of the closest ish

630
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,530
-- thing,
-- but it's still the same problem.

631
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,579
Exactly. Yeah.

632
00:27:31,729 --> 00:27:32,479
But I mean,

633
00:27:32,489 --> 00:27:34,560
like the only people who can write their own operating is more

634
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:38,709
like Microsoft and Apple and even they lean way heavy on Apple

635
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:42,630
didn't write their own operating system. Apple took free BS D

636
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,800
-- actually.
-- No, you're right.

637
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:47,530
They basically did just repackage most previously and a bit of, uh,

638
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,400
what you might call it

639
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:53,069
-- space and out. What's that old thing called?
-- Which the old thing that the next,

640
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,050
-- yeah.
-- Next,

641
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,339
because they bought next to get Steve jobs and then,

642
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:03,040
-- yeah,
-- even, but, but that's my point, like even a modern massive multi multi

643
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,910
gazillion dollar company like Microsoft or Apple can't

644
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:07,579
not use open source,

645
00:28:08,449 --> 00:28:09,910
the economics of it again

646
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:10,430
like

647
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:11,479
that,

648
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,160
that's it. You know, it's

649
00:28:13,709 --> 00:28:14,489
here we are.

650
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,709
And I think what we're going to see is these companies not,

651
00:28:16,719 --> 00:28:20,060
not like maliciously or really intentionally kind of do these things.

652
00:28:20,069 --> 00:28:22,510
But I think they are going to try and create that expectation of like, oh,

653
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,540
you provide open source.

654
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:26,209
-- Well, you know, you do have a duty to humanity
-- to

655
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:30,969
create that expectation. They create it right now for these projects.

656
00:28:31,349 --> 00:28:35,540
And I don't know if they know they're doing it even. But anyway, the point is

657
00:28:35,689 --> 00:28:41,104
I think open source maintainers have to recognize that it is OK

658
00:28:41,244 --> 00:28:46,255
to put your project on hold, to abandon your project to walk away.

659
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:48,824
And you don't have to feel eternal guilt

660
00:28:48,834 --> 00:28:51,015
because you're letting some people down because look,

661
00:28:51,025 --> 00:28:52,785
yes, you're gonna let some people down,

662
00:28:52,795 --> 00:28:55,984
but there's also no reason they can't start to help either.

663
00:28:55,994 --> 00:28:56,625
Right.

664
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:59,564
These are also the people that would like literally show up in your house and demand

665
00:28:59,574 --> 00:29:02,185
all the food out of your fridge because they just can't be bothered to go shopping.

666
00:29:02,194 --> 00:29:05,959
I, I don't think so. I think that's an unreasonable comparison.

667
00:29:05,969 --> 00:29:08,589
I think there are people like that. There are people

668
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,900
that have inflated senses of self worth and,

669
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:15,400
-- and that they deserve everything you keep
-- talking about people.

670
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:19,170
-- But in a lot of this, it's organizations and companies,
-- it's people,

671
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:22,579
it's not organizations, it's fundamentally people talking to people.

672
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:24,380
But that's the point is, I think

673
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:28,780
at the end of the day, most of the people filing bugs

674
00:29:28,949 --> 00:29:30,369
making requests,

675
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,089
having

676
00:29:31,194 --> 00:29:32,895
inflated expectations.

677
00:29:32,954 --> 00:29:37,045
They're not bad people and most of them probably don't even know what they're doing,

678
00:29:37,255 --> 00:29:37,535
right?

679
00:29:37,545 --> 00:29:40,224
They probably don't realize the pressure that they're

680
00:29:40,234 --> 00:29:42,295
putting on something like an open source project.

681
00:29:42,305 --> 00:29:44,074
I think it's just part of the machine.

682
00:29:44,104 --> 00:29:47,405
I'm going to disagree with you there because remember that VLC media

683
00:29:47,415 --> 00:29:50,155
player bug that was filed by a Microsoft employee that basically said,

684
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:53,525
look, your VLC changed broke teams and we need you to fix it now.

685
00:29:53,555 --> 00:29:55,574
That was definitely

686
00:29:55,765 --> 00:29:56,935
a bad person,

687
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:02,449
right? But that's, but bad people don't exist in a vacuum in these organizations.

688
00:30:02,459 --> 00:30:03,119
They don't.

689
00:30:03,709 --> 00:30:07,209
And that's because the weird thing is like, I've, I've met people that work for,

690
00:30:07,219 --> 00:30:11,119
tell us my local phone company and these people were nice, decent human beings.

691
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:13,130
And the organization they work for, tell us is

692
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:14,180
evil.

693
00:30:14,189 --> 00:30:17,150
Like tell us health and the things telehealth has done

694
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,939
to try and privatize healthcare in Alberta is evil.

695
00:30:19,949 --> 00:30:21,770
I know for American listeners, you're like, what?

696
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,520
Of course that of course for health care,

697
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:26,109
there are good people working for bad companies.

698
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:28,380
There are bad people working for bad companies.

699
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,410
But one challenge I see is I see

700
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,699
good people working for bad companies doing bad things

701
00:30:32,944 --> 00:30:36,724
-- and that does happen sometimes I agree
-- and they're not really good people anymore

702
00:30:36,864 --> 00:30:40,594
and, and that that can happen sometimes they don't know they're doing bad things.

703
00:30:40,785 --> 00:30:42,204
It's, it's complicated, right?

704
00:30:42,214 --> 00:30:44,604
People are complicated and open source is

705
00:30:44,614 --> 00:30:46,885
complicated because open source is just people.

706
00:30:46,895 --> 00:30:48,905
My point is all of this.

707
00:30:49,405 --> 00:30:51,844
I think we have to build an environment

708
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:55,939
where we can make it ok and safe for

709
00:30:55,949 --> 00:31:00,380
open source project owners and maintainers to step away

710
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:05,819
-- and not have to feel impending, horrible guilt and doom.
-- I have a possible solution

711
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:08,400
and hear me out. You know, the contributor covenant,

712
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:09,530
yes,

713
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:12,689
maybe we should have a user covenant that kind of actually lays

714
00:31:12,699 --> 00:31:16,020
out the rules and the expectations and good behavior and bad behavior.

715
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,540
That is interesting.

716
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:21,949
-- I wonder if the O SI would approve that license where, well, it's
-- not a license,

717
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:22,770
it's an agreement.

718
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,420
-- Right. Well,
-- it would be a license.

719
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,130
-- I mean,
-- contributor covenants, not a license.

720
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:28,079
It basically is.

721
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:29,359
I

722
00:31:29,469 --> 00:31:33,400
know it's a code of conduct. But I'm saying when, when you are a user of open source,

723
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,895
you must accept the open source license to become a user.

724
00:31:36,906 --> 00:31:40,615
Well, what I'm saying is this goes back to a show many years ago or months, years,

725
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:41,095
who knows what the,

726
00:31:41,485 --> 00:31:44,836
where remember we talked about how like if you have 10 users of your open source,

727
00:31:44,845 --> 00:31:45,286
sure, whatever.

728
00:31:45,296 --> 00:31:48,385
But if you have 10 million users of your open source and even 1/10 of

729
00:31:48,395 --> 00:31:51,135
a millionth of a percent of them come back to you and ask for stuff,

730
00:31:51,145 --> 00:31:52,375
you're going to get slammed.

731
00:31:52,895 --> 00:31:55,566
And that's what I'm saying is have a user covenant where like

732
00:31:55,576 --> 00:31:58,806
literally before you can file an issue against this thing in github

733
00:31:58,956 --> 00:32:02,595
that I maintain, you're going to have to agree to this behavior contract.

734
00:32:02,605 --> 00:32:05,452
Like my, my son, both my sons are going on

735
00:32:05,582 --> 00:32:06,602
summer camps

736
00:32:06,921 --> 00:32:09,501
and all the summer camps. Now, I don't know about that in the US.

737
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:14,171
But here in Canada, every summer camp here now has a set of rules that like,

738
00:32:14,312 --> 00:32:18,011
not just the kid has to initial and agree to, but the parents have to agree to.

739
00:32:18,161 --> 00:32:18,761
And it's,

740
00:32:18,862 --> 00:32:20,732
and it's obviously stuff that's happened because it's

741
00:32:20,741 --> 00:32:22,741
like no verbal abuse of the camp counselors,

742
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:24,732
like no blah, blah, blah and it's just insane stuff.

743
00:32:24,741 --> 00:32:25,001
But

744
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,972
you read about like kids sports teams down.

745
00:32:26,982 --> 00:32:30,452
-- It's, that's crazy
-- what you've just described. Kurt is a license

746
00:32:30,722 --> 00:32:33,031
-- that is how the license works. Well, No,
-- no, no.

747
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:34,052
But I'm saying you, you,

748
00:32:34,147 --> 00:32:36,488
I have a license to use my software and do whatever the heck you want with it.

749
00:32:36,498 --> 00:32:39,767
That's independent of you talking to me and getting my attention.

750
00:32:39,777 --> 00:32:42,137
-- No,
-- I, that comes with that. Like

751
00:32:42,307 --> 00:32:44,088
when you look at open source,

752
00:32:44,238 --> 00:32:46,238
there's the, the free as in beer

753
00:32:46,517 --> 00:32:49,027
and there's free as in speech, right?

754
00:32:49,037 --> 00:32:53,307
And the intent being and this is so this is an interesting concept, right?

755
00:32:53,317 --> 00:32:57,947
And I don't think I I it will deserve more thought and future discussion.

756
00:32:57,958 --> 00:33:00,008
So freezing beer is just like free stuff.

757
00:33:00,197 --> 00:33:02,307
You're getting a free thing, whatever, that's it

758
00:33:02,657 --> 00:33:04,203
free isn't speech

759
00:33:04,453 --> 00:33:09,154
is about conveying freedoms onto the person receiving your stuff.

760
00:33:09,163 --> 00:33:11,514
And it's always been a very,

761
00:33:11,884 --> 00:33:13,644
I am conveying freedom

762
00:33:13,823 --> 00:33:15,843
onto the users of my stuff.

763
00:33:16,173 --> 00:33:21,073
It has never really been an expectation of my users conveying a

764
00:33:21,524 --> 00:33:25,864
-- functionally a sort of freedom back onto me.
-- Traditional open source.

765
00:33:25,874 --> 00:33:27,923
The users were generally not problematic because

766
00:33:27,933 --> 00:33:30,793
there just weren't enough to be much.

767
00:33:30,803 --> 00:33:32,323
Yeah, it was very small. I agree.

768
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:35,949
And I think that ship has definitely sailed,

769
00:33:36,489 --> 00:33:39,619
right? Like now everybody is an open source user. Every company is,

770
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:42,890
and I think part of the challenge is is that

771
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:46,160
when I release an open source software and I give you this

772
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:48,130
license and I give you this freedom to do whatever with it

773
00:33:48,579 --> 00:33:51,250
that should not create an obligation for me to then

774
00:33:51,719 --> 00:33:54,420
even answer your issue on github

775
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,199
it doesn't

776
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,660
because the license says

777
00:33:59,069 --> 00:34:02,199
that this software is provided as is

778
00:34:02,329 --> 00:34:06,160
and what I'm saying, but then the users behave as such that they expect that.

779
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,180
And we've never really,

780
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:10,510
we've never really handled that as an industry.

781
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,340
And I literally think,

782
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,300
and I'm not talking about a contributor coming in the sense

783
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:17,289
of like it necessarily being effective as a leader agreement,

784
00:34:17,438 --> 00:34:22,599
but being more effective in a sense of here are like the rules we want to play with.

785
00:34:22,608 --> 00:34:27,708
Because for example, a lot of projects now do not take kind of randomly filed bugs.

786
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:30,458
They have a template and you better fill that template out.

787
00:34:30,467 --> 00:34:32,589
And for example, uh Linux kernel is a great example.

788
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:36,049
If you don't tell them what version of the LINX kernel you're using like, yeah,

789
00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:37,498
they're going to ignore you.

790
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:40,648
-- And rightly so, I mean,
-- sure and any project can do that,

791
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:41,108
right?

792
00:34:41,217 --> 00:34:41,467
But I

793
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:43,649
that we maybe make this a bit more official

794
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:46,800
and actually start teaching people so that we,

795
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:49,918
we add a bit of a gateway and the gateway has the simple

796
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:52,639
of you need to not be a jerk and you need to like,

797
00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:55,469
tell us what version of the software you're running at a minimum, right?

798
00:34:55,478 --> 00:34:58,129
Because I've dealt with that where people report a bug and I'm like, what,

799
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:00,550
like what software is this even?

800
00:35:00,979 --> 00:35:01,760
And I wanna,

801
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:04,719
we're gonna end this conversation and we're going to end this show because I,

802
00:35:04,729 --> 00:35:06,399
I don't think you're wrong.

803
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,229
I think there's something interesting here,

804
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:12,060
but I also think it's very complicated and it could probably stand some thought.

805
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,580
See, I think what it boils down to

806
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:14,639
as a maintainer.

807
00:35:14,649 --> 00:35:18,090
-- I want the nice people to reach out to me
-- and, and that's not the point.

808
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:18,790
The point is,

809
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,760
and the thing we have to end it on is that if you are an

810
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,739
open source maintainer and you need to step

811
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,899
away from your project for whatever reason,

812
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:27,580
it doesn't matter what it is. It's ok to do that.

813
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:28,510
Like it's over

814
00:35:28,805 --> 00:35:33,456
to step back and not read bugs and not supply patches.

815
00:35:33,716 --> 00:35:34,885
-- It's, it's
-- ok.

816
00:35:34,895 --> 00:35:37,506
I would go even a step further and say, you know, it's your project,

817
00:35:37,516 --> 00:35:39,535
you can do whatever you want or don't want to do with it.

818
00:35:39,545 --> 00:35:41,055
That's easy to say.

819
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:45,216
-- But that's not, people are proud of what they do.
-- I know.

820
00:35:45,375 --> 00:35:47,095
But I think we need to tell people like, look,

821
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:50,226
don't maybe let this define your life as much as

822
00:35:50,431 --> 00:35:52,422
well. No, they'll let it define their life.

823
00:35:52,431 --> 00:35:54,052
It should, they should be proud of what they did.

824
00:35:54,062 --> 00:35:55,612
I'm not saying that I'm saying though that

825
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:58,001
when somebody demands a feature or a bug,

826
00:35:58,011 --> 00:36:00,931
feel the freedom to just like ignore them or to say no.

827
00:36:01,221 --> 00:36:02,531
And that's ok

828
00:36:02,812 --> 00:36:05,481
because that's one thing I, I see a lot of developers

829
00:36:05,681 --> 00:36:07,912
in the open source world have a hard time saying no.

830
00:36:07,922 --> 00:36:12,132
And it's funny because the ones that do often say no are then made out to be like mean,

831
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,050
yes. Right. We see that all the time.

832
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,830
Like those people complaining about the links

833
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,379
from developers issuing CV S and like,

834
00:36:17,389 --> 00:36:20,010
but they're mean about it and it's like, no, they're not.

835
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:20,449
And like,

836
00:36:20,649 --> 00:36:24,250
or they point to a male thread and I'm like, no, this is like,

837
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:27,050
-- it's not polite but it's not
-- mean.

838
00:36:27,179 --> 00:36:28,169
All right, I'm ending it.

839
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,770
I think this is a lot to think about. Thank you, Kurt.

840

842
00:36:37,939 --> 00:36:40,760
Thanks everybody. Thanks everyone. Bye bye.
