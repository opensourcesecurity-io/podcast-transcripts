00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,199
Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt Siefried

1
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,600
and my partner in playing video games. Occasionally, Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:12,609 --> 00:00:14,899
I play video games a lot. Not occasionally

3
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,420
I don't have time for it anymore.

4
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:17,870
Plus whenever I play a multiplayer game,

5
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:19,659
I just get killed in the first like five minutes.

6
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,639
I don't play multiplayer games. I'm too bad.

7
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:25,440
I, I mostly play single player, Nintendo games and I, I really like to actually

8
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:26,459
have a switch.

9
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,430
The switch is a marvelous device because I

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,250
can play for like five minutes and then just

11
00:00:30,389 --> 00:00:34,344
put it to sleep and set it to the side and not touch it again for sometimes days.

12
00:00:34,354 --> 00:00:36,254
I get the feel like Nintendo

13
00:00:36,354 --> 00:00:37,613
came out with the Game Boy

14
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:38,414
and

15
00:00:38,683 --> 00:00:40,933
I feel like they're one of those few companies that are like, OK,

16
00:00:40,944 --> 00:00:42,534
what did we do everything right with the game boy?

17
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:43,743
OK, let's just do that again.

18
00:00:43,754 --> 00:00:46,613
-- But with like a color screen
-- and that was the game boy color.

19
00:00:46,624 --> 00:00:47,484
And then,

20
00:00:47,703 --> 00:00:50,214
and then like, let's add some haptic controls and like

21
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,889
accelerometers and stuff and like maybe a little bit of Wi Fi

22
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,459
-- and that's the switch.
-- It it's very good though. Yes.

23
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,700
No, I'm just saying, like, Nintendo's smart enough not to f it up.

24
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:01,979
It is funny because I remember

25
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,260
probably 10 years ago everyone was like, Nintendo is a joke and they're done

26
00:01:06,379 --> 00:01:07,339
and now

27
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,790
they have outs sold. Like, so

28
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,309
it's at,

29
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,569
at this moment in time there's a Nintendo Switch PS five and

30
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,839
the Xbox one or I don't even know what they call it.

31
00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:17,220
Xbox X series X,

32
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:21,550
whatever the switch I believe has outs sold the other two put together

33
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:26,660
because they kind of, they just created like their own market of like we're not the,

34
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,190
the big fancy game system.

35
00:01:28,199 --> 00:01:31,940
We're the game system everyone owns plus their big fancy game system.

36
00:01:31,949 --> 00:01:32,980
And so they've captured

37
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:33,169
Xbox

38
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,260
P CS.

39
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,550
Uh No, no, no, it's OK.

40
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:40,900
So the switch has sold 36 and a quarter million units in the last 29 months worldwide.

41
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:47,139
The PS five sold 35.8 million and the Xbox Series Xs sold 21.35 million.

42
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:47,930
So it's

43
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,419
ok. OK.

44
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,389
-- It's doing well.
-- It's doing very well,

45
00:01:52,589 --> 00:01:52,980
but

46
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:54,790
that's not.

47
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,319
Our topic is not the Nintendo Switch,

48
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,050
even though I would love to talk about it for hours.

49
00:01:58,269 --> 00:01:58,930
So it's, it's

50
00:01:59,529 --> 00:01:59,830
cap

51
00:02:00,029 --> 00:02:01,980
con did a thing that I think is,

52
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,139
well, basically Capon

53
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,739
thinks PC game modeling is no different than cheating,

54
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:09,820
right? And I love this conversation because I think it ties in

55
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,000
with a lot of security things

56
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,130
marvelously

57
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,869
-- Well, and so first of all,
-- summarize the story first, before you go on,

58
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,720
summarize the story about capcom.

59
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,550
So

60
00:02:19,729 --> 00:02:23,410
for years now fans have been using mods to alter games in weird and wonderful ways.

61
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:26,130
Like a great one is um what is it Skyrim? Right. Apparently.

62
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:31,169
Well, somebody tied in open A I to the N PC so that you can actually talk to them now,

63
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,130
right?

64
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:33,369
Seems kind of cool.

65
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:33,699
Uh

66
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,809
oh, So basically they did a presentation shared in the cap on R and D youtube

67
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:39,770
channel

68
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,250
and the video talks about cheating and piracy and

69
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:45,250
PC games and the impact they can have.

70
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,899
As Capcom sees that mods are part of the problem. So, uh here we go

71
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,369
during the presentation around the 14 minute mark.

72
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:54,070
Capcom suggests that mods are no different than cheats.

73
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,059
All mods are defined as cheats except when they are officially supported. It says

74
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,339
what they are doing internally is no different than cheating. It's not that

75
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:03,300
the company is staunchly against players using mods

76
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:04,570
to enhance or switch up the experience.

77
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,990
It does acknowledge that the majority of mods can have a positive impact on the game.

78
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:09,789
Still from a business perspective.

79
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,789
It warns that they can be detrimental both in terms of the

80
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,899
reputational damage that offensive mods can cause and the extra workload,

81
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,429
players who've installed buggy mods can generate for the support team.

82
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:19,470
This the company argues can ultimately lead to

83
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,490
delays in the games production higher development costs.

84
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,160
No stop pause. How does support in a release game

85
00:03:25,809 --> 00:03:26,630
effect

86
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,610
building a new game,

87
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:31,330
like supporting a already released game?

88
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:33,850
Those people have nothing to do with building a new game.

89
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,970
I think their justification is that

90
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:39,699
when people install dodgy mods and it breaks their game and then

91
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,490
they're gonna email Capcom support and say my game is broken.

92
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,869
Please help me and so they have to spend more money on

93
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,089
support people which would take away R and D money for new

94
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:50,600
-- games.
-- You and I both know that's BS because like Linux

95
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,279
taint, I'm just

96
00:03:51,779 --> 00:03:54,779
like the Linux kernel taint mode. Like we're not supporting that,

97
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,979
like come back with a crash dump that isn't tainted.

98
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:02,800
So for those of you that don't know, the Linux kernel has modules has since a

99
00:04:03,179 --> 00:04:03,210
lot.

100
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:10,710
My favorite being the um, the Intel Ether Express pro 10 driver very stable mod.

101
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,490
After that NASA guy fixed it all up anyways.

102
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,630
So the deal is you have mods module, sorry, not mods.

103
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,380
And

104
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:23,040
this way a hardware company could build a close source module for the Linux kernel.

105
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:24,070
That's right. Right.

106
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:26,940
For example, or, or you could just build your own open source module and,

107
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,809
and it doesn't, it's not good enough to get into the Linux kernel or something.

108
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,339
So basically the way it works is

109
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,980
when they,

110
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:35,359
they also encountered this problem where people are running weird and

111
00:04:35,369 --> 00:04:39,079
crappy modules causing crashes and problems and then they're like,

112
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:40,959
hey, Linux des fix this and they're like,

113
00:04:41,309 --> 00:04:44,260
we can't, like when they finally figure out what's going on, like, we,

114
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:45,269
we can't fix this.

115
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,079
So they introduced taint and basically taint to summarize it.

116
00:04:48,309 --> 00:04:53,059
If you're running a clean, officially supported, everything is correct.

117
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,720
Linux kernel, it's not tainted.

118
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,489
And the minute you add anything that little taint flake gets set

119
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,730
and the Linux kernel developers tell you to go away.

120
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:04,480
Yeah. Well, re reproduce it without whatever dodgy crap you haven't

121
00:05:04,859 --> 00:05:05,459
installed.

122
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:06,320
I mean,

123
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:06,470
I

124
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:06,880
get that

125
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,899
you just do that.

126
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:09,730
-- I know, I know
-- this is

127
00:05:09,739 --> 00:05:11,299
-- just
-- a company being like,

128
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:15,299
well, no, no. OK. OK. Hold on, hold on. I wanna, I wanna bring this all back.

129
00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:17,540
So the article also Capcom has a bunch of

130
00:05:17,549 --> 00:05:20,359
comments about piracy and how piracy is ruining everything.

131
00:05:20,369 --> 00:05:21,410
And my favorite,

132
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,399
my favorite quote

133
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:25,010
here is basically

134
00:05:25,179 --> 00:05:28,369
they call piracy and immediately loss a profit.

135
00:05:28,609 --> 00:05:29,359
But then

136
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,470
the next sentence

137
00:05:31,619 --> 00:05:32,510
says then again,

138
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:37,279
Capcom admits that the size of this profit loss is unobservable

139
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,640
because there is no suitable control case to compare it to.

140
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:47,519
Here is I think the fundamental conversation around this whole situation.

141
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,799
This is the equality versus equity

142
00:05:51,179 --> 00:05:52,079
discussion

143
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,000
where

144
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,529
as humans,

145
00:05:54,769 --> 00:05:56,609
we have this like

146
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:00,920
inherent need for equality, right? Where we think

147
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:04,660
I paid off my student loans. It's not fair.

148
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,839
That person doesn't have to pay off theirs.

149
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:10,519
I did this, it's not fair. That person doesn't have to do that

150
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,989
-- and there are millions of discussions. We see
-- this, everybody else is speeding.

151
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,269
-- Why did you pull me over?
-- Right. Exactly.

152
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,809
We see this in security where security, like,

153
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,320
we obsess over these minute details and we don't look at like, big picture,

154
00:06:25,329 --> 00:06:26,170
we don't say

155
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,089
every single welfare system in North America that

156
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,589
spends how much money trying to prevent fraud

157
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,230
versus the actual fraud amounts.

158
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:34,929
It's,

159
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,369
I've, I've read some reports that point out that it's just bonkers.

160
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,570
Yes. Exactly. Exactly. That

161
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,450
versus,

162
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:46,269
but more equitable situations where you could say like, OK,

163
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,279
I know there's going to be some piracy.

164
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,679
Some of the people are just genuinely thieves.

165
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,489
Some of the people can't afford it, you know, the whatever,

166
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,630
there's a million reasons

167
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:56,489
rather than trying to say it's an even playing field.

168
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,059
Let's just deal with what we've got and go from there

169
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,679
and similar situations like insecurity where

170
00:07:02,953 --> 00:07:06,572
you see these obsessions over like zero vulnerabilities or we

171
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,882
have to meet all the controls or we can't have

172
00:07:09,102 --> 00:07:10,013
anyone,

173
00:07:10,203 --> 00:07:13,523
-- you know, failing the fishing test or whatever.
-- My favorite is capas

174
00:07:13,743 --> 00:07:17,023
now where the computers are better at captures than you.

175
00:07:17,423 --> 00:07:18,252
I know. Right.

176
00:07:18,263 --> 00:07:20,243
Because I, and I'm straight up like, oh perfect example,

177
00:07:20,252 --> 00:07:21,733
I'm gonna throw CV under the bus here.

178
00:07:21,752 --> 00:07:23,192
The CV form has a capa

179
00:07:23,325 --> 00:07:24,915
it's visual only. It's not,

180
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:25,726
there's no

181
00:07:25,865 --> 00:07:27,015
accessible option

182
00:07:27,235 --> 00:07:31,686
and the capture was so bad that I failed it several times

183
00:07:31,976 --> 00:07:33,385
before I succeeded.

184
00:07:33,835 --> 00:07:35,085
Apparently.

185
00:07:35,436 --> 00:07:36,066
Like, it was,

186
00:07:36,545 --> 00:07:38,506
it was dang near unreadable.

187
00:07:38,515 --> 00:07:39,466
And I'm, I, like,

188
00:07:39,476 --> 00:07:43,735
I have a big monitor and like the thought of doing this on a phone or a mobile device.

189
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,510
I don't,

190
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:47,399
I could barely do it on my PC.

191
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:48,239
And so it's just,

192
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,440
yeah, so

193
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:54,130
bizarre that we like, and I get that abuse and all these things do happen at scale.

194
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,230
Like we had some spammers come through our

195
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:58,519
social platform and like register bad accounts.

196
00:07:58,529 --> 00:07:58,859
But,

197
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,989
but yeah, in general, especially with piracy and you know,

198
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,799
like the traditional view is piracy takes something away in the form of revenue.

199
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:09,820
The traditional thing is like the traditional argument is like,

200
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:12,200
you're not allowed to take somebody's car, use it and return it

201
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:13,140
because, well,

202
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:16,429
you didn't get permission and also wear and tear and you might crash it or whatever.

203
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,160
Well, sure

204
00:08:17,549 --> 00:08:19,920
piracy doesn't have that problem.

205
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:23,079
It's digital bits that were copied, right?

206
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:27,149
The original copy is still healthy and safe and fine. Wherever it is.

207
00:08:27,859 --> 00:08:28,329
Number two,

208
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:29,760
you can make the argument that like if somebody has a

209
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:32,219
Pirated copy and they phone in for support that increases cost.

210
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:32,669
But that's

211
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,969
ok. I don't want to dwell on piracy. I don't think piracy is important here, I think.

212
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,450
-- Well,
-- it's

213
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,570
-- so
-- weird that it's still,

214
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:43,010
I think what gets me about piracy is that we're still seeing the exact same argument

215
00:08:43,344 --> 00:08:44,645
that we saw 30 years ago.

216
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:48,265
-- But
-- no, no, this, this makes sense No, no. And it is, look at security,

217
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:53,114
we see security arguments that are decades old that we know they don't work,

218
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:54,875
but we still do it that way.

219
00:08:54,885 --> 00:08:55,265
I mean,

220
00:08:55,525 --> 00:08:58,635
-- the password rotation. Yeah, passwords
-- are one of my favorite where

221
00:08:58,844 --> 00:09:02,765
like Nist has just said that these, this is not how it works

222
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:03,455
yet.

223
00:09:03,465 --> 00:09:08,015
There is pervasive attitudes of how passwords should work because I mean,

224
00:09:08,025 --> 00:09:09,864
passwords are a perfect example where

225
00:09:10,065 --> 00:09:11,515
as squishy humans,

226
00:09:11,989 --> 00:09:15,450
it feels like complicated passwords are better

227
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,840
and changing passwords more often is better,

228
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:18,030
right?

229
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:21,099
Like these are things that feel right to us as people.

230
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,140
And I think,

231
00:09:22,659 --> 00:09:26,460
you know, focusing on modding software or, or whatever

232
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:30,650
it feels like someone is taking my hard work

233
00:09:31,109 --> 00:09:32,309
and they're ruining it,

234
00:09:32,969 --> 00:09:34,270
right? I mean, this is like,

235
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:37,659
like derivative works and art and, and remember when

236
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,059
I forget the name of it,

237
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,710
it was like the Andy Warhol crew where they were all about

238
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:44,960
like art should be reproducible and modifiable and all this stuff.

239
00:09:44,969 --> 00:09:47,979
-- And
-- a lot of, well, the Campbell's, oh the the prince, prince,

240
00:09:47,989 --> 00:09:50,580
the art is formerly known as Prince, right?

241
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,530
Princes of him and the ownership of that photo

242
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:56,340
and the reproduction of it and all that mess.

243
00:09:58,289 --> 00:10:02,599
Tons of artists were like these people are nuts. Like this is an art, art,

244
00:10:02,739 --> 00:10:05,690
art is what I make and if you touch my art, you're ruining it.

245
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,869
Well, I'm pretty sure like, you know,

246
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,570
when somebody built a paint brush instead of using their fingers.

247
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,929
Everybody else was like, oh,

248
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,489
that's cheating. Like you can't, you can't use animal hair on a stick.

249
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:15,729
That's how you use your finger.

250
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,500
You can only smear various substances with your fingers,

251
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,440
right? Like,

252
00:10:21,619 --> 00:10:25,010
well that's, that's like, remember like my favorite is Tron

253
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:25,969
Great movie

254
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,729
10 effects for special effects because it was essentially they used computers

255
00:10:30,739 --> 00:10:32,809
for the special effects and this had never been done before.

256
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,750
Therefore,

257
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,669
you're like,

258
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,159
yeah, you're cheating. Like, we can't give you

259
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,400
the award for special effects,

260
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:39,940
even though clearly the movie has really

261
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,880
good special effects and it's awesome movie.

262
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,679
And we're still talking about 40 years later

263
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,440
-- because
-- it's still awesome.

264
00:10:45,469 --> 00:10:46,750
Yeah, like, even my son loves it.

265
00:10:46,989 --> 00:10:50,270
I mean, you know what's funny is I watched the new Tron not too long ago

266
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,250
and I was like,

267
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:55,044
this isn't a bad movie but like the, the first one is just like,

268
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,325
so good and I feel like it's still good.

269
00:10:57,335 --> 00:11:00,765
The second one almost made it, especially with having

270
00:11:00,974 --> 00:11:02,684
the music and, you know,

271
00:11:02,794 --> 00:11:04,585
the, the crew and cast. But

272
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:07,364
yeah, it just kind of, and it was like,

273
00:11:08,044 --> 00:11:11,164
it was like the first one was a sandwich from a really small place

274
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,830
with people who yell at each other because they're

275
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,609
family and the second sandwich was from like subway.

276
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,609
Yeah. Yeah, that's fair. It was a good sandwich but it could have been better

277
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,330
anyway. Ok.

278
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,289
I want to bring us back to the,

279
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:26,890
the bigger conversation right around modding and

280
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,090
cheating and piracy and all this stuff.

281
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:30,010
And here's the thing,

282
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,469
the one thing I also want to, uh,

283
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:33,690
because we talked about this in a previous episode with the Minecraft stuff.

284
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,250
But in my mind, if you are playing a single player game by yourself,

285
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,890
who cares what you do? Who like, like,

286
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,169
I'm sure people play solitaire with physical cards and cheat. Who cares?

287
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,169
But when you sit down at a table in Vegas and are playing poker,

288
00:11:46,609 --> 00:11:49,510
you're not allowed to look at the cards because that would be cheating in a way

289
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,770
that like for a game that matters with money on the line or against other people.

290
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:56,309
And so I would say I would, I would bucket it into three big buckets.

291
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,010
Number one playing

292
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,309
yourself sort of unranked. Doesn't matter.

293
00:11:59,409 --> 00:12:01,150
Number two, playing with others ranked

294
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:01,750
cheating.

295
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,460
Their kind of a dick move like this happens a lot in chess.com where

296
00:12:04,469 --> 00:12:07,650
people will start using a chess engine to play chess and stomp everybody.

297
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:08,539
And it kind of like,

298
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:12,520
well, I'm like 1100 elo, I want to play an 1100 elo game and have fun. I don't

299
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,450
want to get stomped by somebody using a chess ball, you know, playing at 3000 delo.

300
00:12:16,789 --> 00:12:19,979
And then the third bucket where cheating is clearly cannot be

301
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:23,049
allowed is where you have like tournament play or play for money

302
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:25,250
where you actually have

303
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:27,969
rules because there's money on the line and regulations,

304
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,450
right? So I would say those are the three main buckets of kind of how games are played.

305
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:33,369
And for the first bucket, single player

306
00:12:33,729 --> 00:12:34,409
don't care

307
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,169
for the second bucket. I would argue

308
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:41,070
you should be allowed to cheat in a cheating loud and acknowledged.

309
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:44,359
You should have a stream for people who want to play moded games or cheat.

310
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:46,630
And you see this with like Age of Empires, like,

311
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,799
there's people playing modded Age of Empires in

312
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,179
-- multiplayer and they all agree to play
-- it

313
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:55,049
and they, I assume they have the same mods and things like that then.

314
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:57,820
-- Yeah. Well,
-- yeah, otherwise that would not go well,

315
00:12:57,869 --> 00:13:00,349
-- I mean, I, I agree.
-- Right.

316
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:03,909
Same with Starcraft. Starcraft has mods. Now there's three additional races,

317
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,150
different mechanics. Kind of cool. They also

318
00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:08,219
portals in one which is really funky.

319
00:13:08,489 --> 00:13:11,679
So, like people that's not cheating, it's like you have to, yeah,

320
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:15,150
you have both have to install the mods and agree to play this moded game.

321
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:18,299
Sure. That's fair. I mean, and portals make everything better

322
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:19,289
to put it bluntly.

323
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,320
This is like saying everybody cheats at monopoly because

324
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,510
everybody plays it not according to the rules.

325
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,250
-- Does anyone play monopoly according
-- to the rules? Exactly.

326
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,229
Right. Does anyone know the rules to monopoly?

327
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,549
It's not cheating if everybody agrees that those are the rules?

328
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,070
I mean, well, it,

329
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,880
-- uh, there
-- are games with cheating mechanics built in.

330
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,000
But

331
00:13:38,429 --> 00:13:43,130
you can say that saying it's not cheating if everyone agrees to the rules

332
00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:44,080
is

333
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:51,229
counter to the current copyright holder versus receiver

334
00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:54,809
-- Digital Universe we live in.
-- Let's take monopoly as an example.

335
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,789
So if I want to play monopoly online with my house

336
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:00,630
rules and I mod the game that's like D MC,

337
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,179
a circumvention and illegal.

338
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,979
But if we're playing over the table O TB

339
00:14:05,489 --> 00:14:07,630
to grab a chess term that I've learned because I'm

340
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:08,760
otg

341
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,549
-- over the table, like physically present over the
-- table would be O tt

342
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,109
-- you said ot over the board?
-- Sorry.

343
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,450
So I would apply monopoly as well.

344
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,409
So if we're playing over the board and we agreed to change rule like free parking,

345
00:14:22,419 --> 00:14:23,070
you win money,

346
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:23,950
right?

347
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:25,489
That's legal

348
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:27,669
rule. Like,

349
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:28,679
-- but that's what
-- I,

350
00:14:29,265 --> 00:14:29,525
if we

351
00:14:29,684 --> 00:14:29,705
do

352
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:29,934
this,

353
00:14:30,695 --> 00:14:33,405
it's like a massive fine and like jail time.

354
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,205
And if we just do it over the board, it's like,

355
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:35,724
well,

356
00:14:36,104 --> 00:14:36,125
you

357
00:14:36,234 --> 00:14:36,265
can

358
00:14:36,385 --> 00:14:36,455
agree

359
00:14:37,445 --> 00:14:38,164
to

360
00:14:38,265 --> 00:14:45,104
digital rights on content. If I have a bunch of MP threes, I can't sell them to you

361
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:51,125
legally. But if I have a CD or a record, I can sell that thing to you,

362
00:14:51,594 --> 00:14:51,965
right?

363
00:14:52,289 --> 00:14:57,640
And I think this is kind of similar where Capcom is complaining about cheaters and

364
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,330
mos

365
00:14:58,549 --> 00:14:59,309
because

366
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:05,070
it's changing the thing they made and they obviously don't like people doing that.

367
00:15:05,859 --> 00:15:06,549
It, it just,

368
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:08,789
it seems to always boil down to this weird version

369
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,549
of like they want to just control it all.

370
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,190
But

371
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:14,239
I feel like, like security teams come. Right.

372
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,190
But the thing that also gets me is like, a lot of these games

373
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:21,590
do much better because of the mods,

374
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,940
I think, yes, if Skyrim didn't have mods,

375
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,679
I don't think we'd still be talking about Skyrim.

376
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,869
-- What, like 20 years later, you know what
-- it reminds me of?

377
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:35,229
It reminds me of Twitter where, yeah, like only 0.000001% of people actually

378
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:36,969
really post interesting content

379
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:39,969
and that's why they need access to the API because yeah,

380
00:15:39,979 --> 00:15:42,659
the vast majority of people want API access.

381
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,609
But if you shut off that API access as we like,

382
00:15:45,739 --> 00:15:47,510
well, at the cloud security lines,

383
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,270
we can't use our third party social media management tool anymore.

384
00:15:51,859 --> 00:15:52,030
Ah

385
00:15:52,489 --> 00:15:55,010
Right. Like, because we have an account

386
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,030
that is

387
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:56,729
like

388
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:00,219
more than one or two people need to post to on a schedule

389
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,679
with, combined with other things to linkedin and everything. Right?

390
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,909
And that's the other thing that gets me is like by taking

391
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:10,119
away this ability to kind of personalize or modify or whatever the game

392
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,320
you're telling all the power users to go away. And

393
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,340
if you lose that community, I

394
00:16:16,169 --> 00:16:17,669
that's, I would agree.

395
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:21,750
But I think that comes back to the equality versus equitable discussion

396
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,309
is if you want to say everyone is equal,

397
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,820
we're going to crack down on everyone using this thing versus saying

398
00:16:29,099 --> 00:16:30,309
there's a group of people,

399
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,570
we need to be doing this and we know there's going

400
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,830
to be some abusers that sneak in for spam or whatever.

401
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:41,039
But we can't let do that small number, ruin the experience for everyone else.

402
00:16:41,099 --> 00:16:43,979
And I get it because, like, you know, I'm, well, the, like the whole

403
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:46,530
Tarkoff cheating thing where it's ruining it for everybody. Right.

404
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:49,559
Because cheaters are just rampantly running around and, you know,

405
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,830
ging everybody.

406
00:16:51,169 --> 00:16:53,080
But again, like there's, there's ways to,

407
00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:54,969
you know, to go back to Starcraft,

408
00:16:54,979 --> 00:16:57,039
there's a really good way to know if you're cheating on the ladder.

409
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:01,190
And that is, if your r weight is over, then if your win rate is more than 50%

410
00:17:01,299 --> 00:17:03,320
then you're ranked too low.

411
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,358
-- It's that simple now. And
-- obviously you get ranked higher, then if that happens,

412
00:17:08,489 --> 00:17:10,040
you get ranked higher as you win.

413
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:13,900
And so people will intentionally join a game and immediately quit it to like, lose it

414
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,310
right to bring down their mmr to go smurfing.

415
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:20,280
But again, that's pretty, you know, stuff like that is easy to detect.

416
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:21,358
And so

417
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:26,000
I like what gets me is also is I suspect it's not about equality and equity.

418
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,050
It's about we want control.

419
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:31,119
What story can we tell? That's better than

420
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:32,839
we want control.

421
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,439
Oh, we're trying to make it fair.

422
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:39,989
-- That's a much better story than I want to control this.
-- I mean, that's fair.

423
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,380
That's II I won't disagree with you. I think so. This is where I'm going.

424
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,680
I want to bring this right back to

425
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:47,040
security because we're a security podcast after all.

426
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,349
I feel like I say that too often,

427
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:49,180
but

428
00:17:50,239 --> 00:17:52,209
are we, no one knows,

429
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:52,500
but

430
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:52,770
anyone

431
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,099
could have started on healthcare.

432
00:17:54,569 --> 00:17:54,890
-- Not
-- today,

433
00:17:55,329 --> 00:17:56,040
not today.

434
00:17:56,469 --> 00:17:57,959
But so I, I think

435
00:17:58,449 --> 00:18:01,359
the control aspect is important because

436
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:03,280
like security teams

437
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,140
want to control their environments.

438
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:10,359
We just had a vendor submit a questionnaire to us of all the usual stuff

439
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:14,229
and they've come back and they're like freaking out and it's like, yeah, we like,

440
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:16,959
you don't have 100% antivirus coverage of all user devices.

441
00:18:16,969 --> 00:18:19,430
And I'm like, no, not even a little bit because

442
00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:21,209
bring your own device buddy.

443
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,400
And I point out that we're,

444
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,849
we're actually pretty close to having good coverage of all our

445
00:18:24,989 --> 00:18:26,560
computers, but like

446
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:30,550
there's no good antivirus product for mobile. So I'm like,

447
00:18:31,099 --> 00:18:32,599
and I don't think it's necessary.

448
00:18:32,739 --> 00:18:34,369
So, yeah. No, not doing it

449
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:35,630
right.

450
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,260
And like they're freaking out about it like they,

451
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:41,550
and now they apparently want some financial details about us and I'm like,

452
00:18:42,109 --> 00:18:43,060
no, like

453
00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:44,199
they have

454
00:18:44,489 --> 00:18:45,780
all billing contact,

455
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:46,729
you know,

456
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:48,930
like this. Yeah, anyways.

457
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:49,780
So

458
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:54,209
I feel like a lot of companies just, they're stuck in those old mindsets of like,

459
00:18:54,219 --> 00:18:55,930
yeah, we want to control this.

460
00:18:55,939 --> 00:18:57,400
We don't want any negative, you know,

461
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,920
we don't want negative mods floating around of like,

462
00:19:00,069 --> 00:19:04,250
you know, or like GT A remember when people were like beating up the prostitutes to,

463
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:05,300
what was it?

464
00:19:05,469 --> 00:19:05,540
Oh,

465
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,770
they would use the prostitute to gain health and then they

466
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,229
would beat them up to steal their money and stuff.

467
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:11,189
And everybody's like, that's socially terrible. And it's like,

468
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,180
well, I mean,

469
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,530
it's GT a four.

470
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:18,089
Yeah, it's socially GT a, the premise of the game is to be socially terrible. Like,

471
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,030
did I,

472
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:21,239
like, you're literally grand.

473
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,380
It's the name.

474
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:23,660
-- Yeah.
-- You're the bad guy.

475
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,660
Like, it's Grand Theft auto. Like that is,

476
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:26,869
there's

477
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:27,880
what?

478
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,489
And yeah. Yeah.

479
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,260
And I'm like, and they're worried about their reputation. What?

480
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,180
I don't know if rock

481
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,020
-- star cares,
-- like, you don't get well, but you know,

482
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,550
you don't get to make that argument.

483
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:38,839
Like

484
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,180
anyways, I, I,

485
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:44,439
-- this conversation has gone off the rails but
-- I, well, but no, you're right.

486
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:48,000
There are so many parallels with security where people want to control stuff.

487
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,520
And the question is

488
00:19:49,699 --> 00:19:50,930
I would always have is

489
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,800
why do you want to control it?

490
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:55,339
And they always come back with oil to reduce risk and to manage it.

491
00:19:55,349 --> 00:20:01,280
-- And I'm like, but does it actually do that?
-- No, almost never. Rarely. Yeah, for sure.

492
00:20:01,364 --> 00:20:04,385
I mean, my favorite example is I think fishing training.

493
00:20:04,395 --> 00:20:05,025
I love,

494
00:20:05,035 --> 00:20:08,145
I love beating on fishing training because there's so many people that obsess over

495
00:20:08,155 --> 00:20:09,905
fishing training and it's like studies have

496
00:20:09,915 --> 00:20:12,824
consistently shown fishing training while it might have

497
00:20:13,035 --> 00:20:16,694
minor differences between tests where you could say, oh,

498
00:20:16,704 --> 00:20:19,885
we have 10% less fishing in our, our testing now and whatnot.

499
00:20:19,895 --> 00:20:20,275
Like

500
00:20:20,464 --> 00:20:23,125
the entire intent behind fishing

501
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:26,089
is to exploit the very thing that makes us human.

502
00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:31,380
Like you can't, you can't, if people are people, they can be fished like that's all.

503
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:31,680
Yeah.

504
00:20:31,719 --> 00:20:35,520
And I would say there's putting in actually effective security controls like multi

505
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:39,430
factor Fido based authentication where you can't give it to the wrong site.

506
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,540
That's what you see.

507
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:41,810
But that,

508
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,459
but see that actually requires the it crew to do something that's hard

509
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:50,569
whereas they can externalize the cost of fishing by putting it on to the users,

510
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:51,439
bad users.

511
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:52,449
Right. Exactly.

512
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,369
Or another way to sort of externalize the cost

513
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,430
but is somewhat useful is to teach them.

514
00:20:56,439 --> 00:21:01,229
Like if Bob asks you to do X reach out back to Bob on a good,

515
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:03,089
like known good email or whatever,

516
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:05,400
like don't just let Bob at gmail.com email you

517
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,930
saying like change the payment details for this check,

518
00:21:07,939 --> 00:21:08,369
please?

519
00:21:09,189 --> 00:21:10,119
Right. Exactly.

520
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,719
Like that's an example of you're still sort of Externalizing the cost,

521
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,439
but at least it has the possibility of working

522
00:21:15,869 --> 00:21:17,520
and see this is what frustrates me is.

523
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,619
It's like spanking your kids.

524
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:22,219
I was spanked as a child.

525
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:25,400
I grew up kind of thinking that was normal.

526
00:21:25,579 --> 00:21:29,939
And then when I had kids, my now ex-wife was like, yeah, we're not spanking, right?

527
00:21:29,949 --> 00:21:31,000
And I'm like, what do you mean we're not spanking?

528
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:33,160
Of course, we're spanking, spank your kids and she's like,

529
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,939
it's bad for kids. And I'm like, huh, what do you mean? She's, like, study show.

530
00:21:35,949 --> 00:21:37,810
It's bad for your kids. So, I actually went and checked

531
00:21:37,939 --> 00:21:39,319
the current literature on it

532
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:40,310
and I'm like,

533
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:43,979
oh, so spanking is, it is actually bad for your kids.

534
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:46,130
And my favorite part doesn't work.

535
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,709
And the simplest argument I would have is,

536
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,550
did you get spanked more than once as a child?

537
00:21:50,569 --> 00:21:51,589
Yes, of course. You did.

538
00:21:51,949 --> 00:21:52,420
You get spanked

539
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:52,569
more?

540
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:53,729
So then

541
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,329
how's that working?

542
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,800
Right. If it works for sure.

543
00:21:58,989 --> 00:21:59,439
Right.

544
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:02,469
And so I'm like, ok, so it emotionally damages your child and it doesn't work.

545
00:22:02,479 --> 00:22:05,640
Ok, we're not spanking our kids. And I remember actually when Felix was eight,

546
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,880
uh, we were talking about it and he's like, what's spanking? And I'm like, wow,

547
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:10,920
ok, that's,

548
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,060
I feel a bit better as a parent today,

549
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,900
you know, and I had to explain to him what spanking was and he's like,

550
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,420
that sounds like you're hitting them and I'm like

551
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,069
that,

552
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,089
like it is kind of a bit assaulting

553
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:21,250
a

554
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:22,520
little bit.

555
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,599
Like if I did that in public to a stranger, I feel like the cops might yell at me.

556
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,910
Right. Like, that's, that's kind of my yardstick for a lot of behaviors.

557
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,420
Now, it's like if I or better yet,

558
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:35,660
if I did that to a cop in public without their consent,

559
00:22:36,349 --> 00:22:37,390
-- how is that gonna go?
-- Well,

560
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,819
but again, again,

561
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,770
this comes back to that idea of as humans

562
00:22:43,369 --> 00:22:43,760
if

563
00:22:44,005 --> 00:22:44,905
there's a very,

564
00:22:44,915 --> 00:22:50,364
I have done a thing and I feel like it has changed the situation for the better.

565
00:22:50,555 --> 00:22:50,765
Well,

566
00:22:50,775 --> 00:22:54,675
I can't help but wonder too if people hang on to these things as effective because

567
00:22:54,854 --> 00:22:57,584
they would have to admit they're wrong. Like the password thing, like the,

568
00:22:58,474 --> 00:22:58,494
for

569
00:22:58,635 --> 00:22:59,244
sure he can.

570
00:22:59,375 --> 00:22:59,954
And he's like,

571
00:23:00,415 --> 00:23:00,724
and,

572
00:23:00,834 --> 00:23:02,344
but people would have to admit they were wrong.

573
00:23:02,354 --> 00:23:04,224
And how often do people say, you know what

574
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,479
that thing I spent 10 years saying to do? Yeah, it was wrong.

575
00:23:08,489 --> 00:23:11,939
A lot of people don't ever like to admit they're wrong. I mean, for sure.

576
00:23:11,949 --> 00:23:13,760
And that's like a whole different discussion.

577
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,369
But I, I think

578
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:18,609
this is where like, like, so Capcom, I'm gonna, I'll,

579
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:20,239
I'll go back to them for a moment

580
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:22,719
with their cheating and their piracy and everything.

581
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,640
It would be marvelous

582
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,040
if they did

583
00:23:26,199 --> 00:23:29,359
like an an in depth investigation to understand

584
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,189
like,

585
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:34,310
look at how much piracy a game has, look at how much revenue the game has,

586
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,790
look at how much modding the game has and correlating some of this data

587
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:40,949
instead of saying we feel like it's bad.

588
00:23:41,109 --> 00:23:43,920
Well, and so, you know, Microsoft was famously said,

589
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:45,770
people said Microsoft should do that, right?

590
00:23:45,949 --> 00:23:49,550
And Microsoft kind of didn't that they gave away Windows 7 to 11 upgrades,

591
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:50,800
right? Like

592
00:23:51,069 --> 00:23:53,910
they, you know, essentially made Windows like, yeah,

593
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,170
you want to download the iso it used to be a very big process.

594
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,270
Now, it's like two clicks

595
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,410
and you just need a valid key

596
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:03,500
and you can just straight up plug in your, well, you used to be able to straight up,

597
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:03,849
plug it.

598
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:04,020
Like,

599
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,729
I'd have to go find the DVD and like look at

600
00:24:05,739 --> 00:24:08,040
the key and plug it in to my windows 11 install.

601
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,719
That's like what I'm currently sitting on. So,

602
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:13,079
but then the problem becomes too, is a smart company will

603
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,859
encourage piracy

604
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,339
and dominate the market.

605
00:24:16,349 --> 00:24:17,459
And then because here's the thing,

606
00:24:17,469 --> 00:24:20,920
if let's say 1% of people are going to buy your product.

607
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:25,189
Well, if you give it away for free, for one or two revisions

608
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:29,979
and they get 1% of the total market versus just like the few people willing to pay

609
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:33,619
you, you potentially make a lot more money in the long term. And

610
00:24:33,829 --> 00:24:37,410
I'm not sure that that's such a bad thing for the company because the company is not

611
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,489
like they're selling their product and they're allowing piracy. I

612
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,900
it's funny to me that people get angry

613
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:45,150
when companies do allow piracy because it's like,

614
00:24:45,189 --> 00:24:46,859
but they're going to take over the market and then they're going to

615
00:24:46,869 --> 00:24:48,900
sell it and crack down on piracy and it's kind of like,

616
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,939
so don't use them.

617
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,400
So, so there is an actual

618
00:24:52,564 --> 00:24:55,685
parallel we recently discussed all about this.

619
00:24:55,834 --> 00:24:56,474
Remember Hay

620
00:24:56,864 --> 00:24:58,425
Corp changing their license,

621
00:24:59,104 --> 00:25:03,925
you could argue it was the same tactic as encouraging piracy of your application

622
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:06,635
and then one day deciding we're going to actually start going after people.

623
00:25:06,685 --> 00:25:09,155
-- It is suspiciously parallel. And
-- if you look at hashy

624
00:25:09,385 --> 00:25:09,785
Corp,

625
00:25:10,155 --> 00:25:13,265
let's just say they're not having a great time right now.

626
00:25:13,574 --> 00:25:14,685
They lost them.

627
00:25:15,439 --> 00:25:17,069
What is the phrase they use? Oh, yeah.

628
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:19,640
Uh The, the that shows up on the sec reports,

629
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:22,319
the measure of goodwill and that number like,

630
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:28,359
yeah, I'm glad I'm not a hashy corps shareholder. That's pretty much what I see

631
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:28,810
here.

632
00:25:29,089 --> 00:25:32,199
But I, I think again, this is that whole

633
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:35,739
a quality versus equitable, right? Where

634
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,579
when you're hatching

635
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:39,050
Corp and you're doing all this work in open source and

636
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:42,050
it feels like people are taking advantage of your work,

637
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,699
which that's a different argument, right?

638
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:48,540
-- Versus saying like we understand,
-- see that's the thing.

639
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,540
If they didn't want people to take advantage of their work,

640
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,939
they shouldn't have released it under an open source license.

641
00:25:52,949 --> 00:25:54,380
I agree.

642
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:56,530
However, the hip

643
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,060
start up business model

644
00:25:58,189 --> 00:25:58,579
is,

645
00:25:58,589 --> 00:26:02,099
I'm going to release a bunch of stuff open source because now I can get attention

646
00:26:02,109 --> 00:26:05,380
for my open source and then I'm going to chain pull the rug out someday.

647
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:06,430
Well, the thing is,

648
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:09,839
it basically allows a company to gather a whole bunch of free value,

649
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:15,040
right? They get to harvest a whole bunch of free value for zero cost or very low cost

650
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:19,459
-- and then lock it up.
-- Sounds like the modern community to me,

651
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:20,819
right?

652
00:26:21,939 --> 00:26:24,880
So I don't know I just, I do wish,

653
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:26,280
like, I,

654
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,369
I do wish that there was sort of,

655
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:32,400
let's stop pretending and have ranked play for cheaters.

656
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:33,780
Kind of like the same thing with, like,

657
00:26:33,989 --> 00:26:35,369
you know, there's always that argument that, like,

658
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,920
I want to see the Olympics but with no drug testing and it's like, you know,

659
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,630
like, yeah, those people are going to wreck their bodies.

660
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,770
But if you look at the average Olympic athlete, like a lot of them,

661
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,410
they, they don't have, they have a lot of health problems long term.

662
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:47,780
Yeah. Yeah,

663
00:26:47,979 --> 00:26:48,000
for

664
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,209
sure,

665
00:26:48,579 --> 00:26:48,599
for

666
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,000
sure.

667
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:50,140
So

668
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:53,099
I kind of wish we would stop this game and like,

669
00:26:53,109 --> 00:26:56,000
if people want to cheat or they want to play Skyrim with everybody.

670
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:56,369
But,

671
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:00,599
and the other thing too is this totally ignores the issue of accessibility where,

672
00:27:00,979 --> 00:27:01,479
like,

673
00:27:01,819 --> 00:27:05,290
maybe I don't have arms but I still want to play video games.

674
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,160
Yeah,

675
00:27:06,449 --> 00:27:09,219
like there's mouse mice for your feet and stuff and,

676
00:27:09,489 --> 00:27:12,760
you know, control inputs that track your head and your eye movement and stuff.

677
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:15,630
-- There's
-- actually, so there's like, I don't know if, do you remember Ben? Heck

678
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:16,280
did

679
00:27:16,439 --> 00:27:21,030
he ring a bell? He had a, he used to do an Element 14 show called Ben Heck Hacks.

680
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,780
And he would do like amazing projects.

681
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,130
So he's since

682
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:28,430
I don't know why he's not with Element 14 anymore, I have a suspicion.

683
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:31,349
It wasn't a particularly pleasant departure, but

684
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,900
he still has a youtube channel and I love watching him.

685
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,609
And one of the things he does is Ben

686
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:39,530
heck mods controllers to be like one handed devices.

687
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,969
And like his videos are fascinating and he talks all about the process and he,

688
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,060
and it's amazing

689
00:27:44,339 --> 00:27:48,239
and that's a great example of him, like literally taking a thing, someone made,

690
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:50,339
he's changing it and then he's reselling it,

691
00:27:50,449 --> 00:27:51,989
like in the digital world

692
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:52,750
that's

693
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,380
100% off limits.

694
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:57,119
You know, it cracks me up like you see cars, like, um,

695
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:59,209
I had a neighbor who was in a wheelchair and he

696
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,839
had a pickup truck with like a little crane in the back

697
00:28:02,339 --> 00:28:03,420
so that he could like,

698
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:07,319
get into his truck and then have the little crane kind of grab his wheelchair and

699
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,119
swing it and throw it in the back of his

700
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:12,260
truck because funnily enough when you don't have working legs,

701
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:15,619
it's really hard to get into a truck and then put your wheelchair

702
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:16,819
like

703
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,020
somewhere

704
00:28:18,349 --> 00:28:19,780
in the truck.

705
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,739
Right. Right. Who knew? Right.

706
00:28:22,189 --> 00:28:22,780
And

707
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:23,930
yeah, so

708
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,420
I, I don't know, I just, it, it really also comes back to like I bought this game,

709
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,489
do I not own this game?

710
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,979
And I get that there's a bit of a gray area

711
00:28:31,989 --> 00:28:34,180
if I'm using an online service to play multiplayer games,

712
00:28:34,189 --> 00:28:34,739
blah, blah, blah.

713
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,969
But fundamentally,

714
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,170
yeah, I feel like,

715
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,910
like the biggest thing I've noticed, I buy apps for my kids, I buy them.

716
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,020
I spend the money.

717
00:28:42,209 --> 00:28:42,660
Right.

718
00:28:43,069 --> 00:28:45,479
And then they either stop working on newer versions

719
00:28:45,489 --> 00:28:47,859
of I OS because of security permission stuff.

720
00:28:48,239 --> 00:28:48,660
Right.

721
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:52,069
Or in the case of I'm gonna call Lego out like I haven't

722
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:54,800
passed their duple game was awesome and then they made it suck.

723
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:57,760
And my son is still sad about it and still wants to watch

724
00:28:57,949 --> 00:29:01,239
the videos on youtube over the playthroughs because he just wants that poor

725
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,790
little bunny rabbit to get his ice cream to share with his friends.

726
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,430
I'm dead serious. That's all he wants.

727
00:29:05,969 --> 00:29:06,430
I mean,

728
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:07,869
it's a valid

729
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,709
-- concern and it's a,
-- it's,

730
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,530
and the worst part is the Lego Juniors game, for example, has been now.

731
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:18,189
It's not even that they modified Lego Juniors so that it sucks.

732
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:20,949
They took it off the store. So we have it running on one ipad.

733
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,900
Gotcha.

734
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:23,010
That

735
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:23,270
orange.

736
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,869
Don't ever get rid of that thing now. Right.

737
00:29:26,619 --> 00:29:26,739
Yeah,

738
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,719
it's a fun game.

739
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,609
I don't, I don't have an answer to this but I think the one,

740
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:33,479
the one takeaway and I think the way we should end this one is just

741
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,589
there

742
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,459
any time we are involved in a situation similar to

743
00:29:39,469 --> 00:29:44,989
like security policy and process or piracy and modding or

744
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:47,839
you know how we're distributing content, whatever is going on.

745
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:52,310
I think our human nature is to default to equality

746
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:55,849
instead of defaulting to like what is actually

747
00:29:55,859 --> 00:29:59,650
equitable and makes sense because sometimes the bad guys

748
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,079
that they, you can't stop them all.

749
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,800
But sometimes trying to stop them all ruins it for everyone else.

750
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:09,099
Well, and it's back to that famous argument of like,

751
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:12,609
if Google affects 0.1% of their user base for an hour.

752
00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:13,489
Yeah, that sucks.

753
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:14,969
But what if they affect

754
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,209
10,000 people forever?

755
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:18,260
Right.

756
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:18,859
That's right.

757
00:30:18,979 --> 00:30:19,609
You know,

758
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,459
and so part of what I've been looking at is like,

759
00:30:21,469 --> 00:30:23,560
what is the actual outcome we want here?

760
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,439
And the actual,

761
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:29,020
and this is what drives me nuts is the actual outcome is it's not that we want to stop

762
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:33,099
the bad or abusive behavior. We want to enable the good behavior

763
00:30:33,229 --> 00:30:35,489
and have like a clean public park without

764
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:38,650
it being covered in trash and dog poop and stuff, right?

765
00:30:38,719 --> 00:30:41,880
So that means we do want people to pick up after their dog or whatever and

766
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,430
there might be other ways to accomplish that

767
00:30:43,439 --> 00:30:45,420
than just trying to like make everybody,

768
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,300
you know, handcuff them when they come to the park.

769
00:30:48,199 --> 00:30:49,359
No. Like you know what I'm saying?

770
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:52,119
Like that's, that's literally what some scared does like this whole capture thing.

771
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,780
Like I'm so glad that we're sort of slowly getting rid of it.

772
00:30:55,209 --> 00:30:55,609
Like pasy

773
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,469
scare me because they are so much better. But at the same time,

774
00:31:00,569 --> 00:31:02,140
if you don't have a compute device,

775
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:05,359
like if Google, like there's a difference between pas

776
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,130
keys being an additional option

777
00:31:07,339 --> 00:31:10,569
and being a mandatory thing and if they're a mandatory thing,

778
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:13,010
you're going to lock out a ton of people.

779
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,660
-- I mean, that's a discussion for another day then
-- on

780
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:19,479
in unsupported account scenarios, which is free services,

781
00:31:19,489 --> 00:31:21,849
we will probably discuss that eventually.

782
00:31:21,859 --> 00:31:24,530
So anyway, I'm, I'm, I'm cutting us off. Thank you, Kurt.
