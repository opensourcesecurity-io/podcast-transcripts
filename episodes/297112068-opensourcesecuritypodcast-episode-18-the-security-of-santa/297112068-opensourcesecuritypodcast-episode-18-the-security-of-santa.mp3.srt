Hello and welcome to a special Christmas episode

1
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,090
of the open source security podcast with myself,

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:11,880
Kurt Siefried

3
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:12,909
and Josh Bresser

4
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:18,459
warning this show may contain Christmas spoilers tree nuts and disappointment.

5
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:21,069
-- Kurt,
-- every episode has disappointment.

6
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,360
However, in this case, if you have small Children, I would suggest you escort them

7
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:26,479
from the room

8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:27,479
very soon

9
00:00:28,209 --> 00:00:32,290
-- or just make them do ear muffs for an hour.
-- That's right. Right ear muffs for an hour.

10
00:00:32,459 --> 00:00:33,150
I love it.

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,009
Fantastic.

12
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:35,180
So, how you doing, man?

13
00:00:35,639 --> 00:00:38,729
I'm doing well. I am really looking forward to Christmas

14
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:40,750
who isn't looking forward to Christmas. Right.

15
00:00:41,169 --> 00:00:41,529
Yeah.

16
00:00:41,689 --> 00:00:43,909
Well, some people, bad people. They're just. No.

17
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,680
Yes. So,

18
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:50,569
uh, the security of Santa.

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,840
Yeah.

20
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:52,889
Now,

21
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,990
do we actually want to start with the big one or do we want to start with his minions?

22
00:00:57,389 --> 00:00:58,490
What's the big one?

23
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:03,049
-- Well, the big one is Santa, but he, he doesn't travel
-- alone, like,

24
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,089
like apart from deer or, or something else.

25
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:10,000
Well, I'm, I've been thinking about the elf on the shelf.

26
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,610
Oh, that thing, I hate the elf on the shelf. My kids have that and it's a nuisance to me.

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,110
Oh, my goodness.

28
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:16,250
I,

29
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:18,739
the worst part, I mean, apart from the,

30
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,980
the whole police state mentality that it brings

31
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,709
is just remembering to move the thing

32
00:01:23,949 --> 00:01:24,300
because

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,510
-- every freaking day
-- I

34
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:27,419
only, I,

35
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:30,830
I read up on it about, about it online

36
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:33,750
and I have to admit I was horrified because correct me if I'm wrong.

37
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,089
But the premise seems to be

38
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:38,139
this thing is watching you and if you do something

39
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,389
bad it'll report back and you get no presents.

40
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,199
Uh It's, well, I mean, that's not unlike the,

41
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:45,800
the general historical nature of Santa, right?

42
00:01:45,809 --> 00:01:49,680
Where, where all parents can tell Santa anything at any time somehow

43
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,339
and if you're bad, then you get nothing,

44
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:54,260
which is never true because you still always give

45
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:55,930
your kids crap no matter how rotten they are.

46
00:01:56,169 --> 00:01:58,790
Uh And then obviously on, on December 26th,

47
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,440
they can go back to being terrible Children and everything's fine till November.

48
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:03,290
However,

49
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,199
so the idea behind the elf on the shelf is it is a money

50
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:10,429
making scheme that is working better than anything I've ever seen in history.

51
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:15,009
You get this Elf which comes with the book and cost a ton of money.

52
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:19,179
And the idea is the elf comes out after when, whenever in, in our case,

53
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,089
it comes out after Thanksgiving and it,

54
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:22,559
it move every night,

55
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,210
you it, it, you put it out somewhere

56
00:02:24,339 --> 00:02:27,089
and every night it flies back to the North Pole

57
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,000
and then tell Santa all about the Children in the house and how, no doubt,

58
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:33,320
wonderful they've been

59
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:34,979
that particular day

60
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,440
and then he comes back before the Children wake up in the morning

61
00:02:38,619 --> 00:02:41,809
and he sits somewhere else in the house. Right.

62
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,520
And then of course,

63
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:44,740
uh I, I don't,

64
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:48,919
I don't do this but I know people who will tell the Elf things or the Children will,

65
00:02:48,929 --> 00:02:52,360
will talk to the elf and ask questions of Santa

66
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,580
and various other things.

67
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:57,320
But I mean, fundamentally, it is a creature that is spying on you

68
00:02:57,699 --> 00:02:59,320
the entire time and,

69
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,940
and will essentially report back to uh Big Brother as to

70
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:06,240
your behavior and if you are deserving of presence or not.

71
00:03:06,589 --> 00:03:08,440
So it's, it's horrifying to say the least.

72
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,720
Yeah, I mean, when I, when I read that and I'm not a huge fan of that,

73
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:13,899
but what even gets me is they,

74
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:17,979
I know they're doing it at my kid's school in the classroom to some degree

75
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,490
and it's not the Elf on the shelf. It's some sort of more non

76
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,380
-- denominational holiday. It's
-- not,

77
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,770
it's an Elf,

78
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:24,720
but

79
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:25,350
there's also,

80
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,070
I'm pretty sure they have like one for Hanukkah now and also the Hanukkah,

81
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,539
some of the other celebrations.

82
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,679
The Hanukkah zombie. Right.

83
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,649
Yeah.

84
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,529
So, I mean,

85
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,720
yeah. No, it's, it's,

86
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:38,580
it's worrying to me that we're, we're,

87
00:03:38,589 --> 00:03:41,820
we're teaching Children that it's normal to live in this, you know,

88
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,210
surveillance state.

89
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,800
Well, it is now. So we're just preparing them for their future

90
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:47,369
in

91
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:50,699
Facebook and Uber know where you've been and,

92
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,479
and what you're doing just like Santa Claus, right?

93
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,419
They know when you're sleeping, they know when you're awake,

94
00:03:54,429 --> 00:03:57,399
they know if you do bad or good should be good for goodness sake.

95
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,100
You know,

96
00:03:58,919 --> 00:03:59,080
Uber

97
00:03:59,470 --> 00:03:59,820
clothes,

98
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:04,110
I have to assume because this is not a new trend when you think about it. Right?

99
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:07,320
There's also things like furby. I don't know if you remember furby back in.

100
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:07,759
When did that

101
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:08,979
back? Dude,

102
00:04:09,179 --> 00:04:09,809
you can buy

103
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:10,300
furs.

104
00:04:11,089 --> 00:04:12,029
They were terrified.

105
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:14,449
You ever see a furby without, without the fake hair,

106
00:04:14,929 --> 00:04:17,279
they look like like nightmare fuel.

107
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,899
But uh I mean,

108
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,059
I remember the NSA banning furby and pretty much all

109
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,890
these other intelligence services banning furbies from the premises,

110
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:25,049
right?

111
00:04:25,059 --> 00:04:27,269
-- Because they can record and play back randomly.
-- Right?

112
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:29,029
Well, you know, funny enough you say that and

113
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:29,760
uh

114
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:31,279
inside

115
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,440
Red Hat,

116
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,570
we have a bot

117
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:34,700
called sec bot

118
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,920
that I assume you're familiar with which I gave in Eliza brain and, and you,

119
00:04:38,929 --> 00:04:41,320
I vetted a bunch of quotes and it's hilarious to talk to.

120
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:41,720
Of course,

121
00:04:42,309 --> 00:04:46,529
I, at one time had it learning from one of the uh security Irc channels we use

122
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,209
and it had picked up too much embargoed information that we had to wipe the brain

123
00:04:50,369 --> 00:04:52,730
and make it never. Yeah, which is really funny.

124
00:04:52,739 --> 00:04:55,309
So I totally get this fury thing, right? It sounds ridiculous.

125
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,429
But like I've experienced this where we had a bot

126
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:02,000
that, that knew about you know, secret security things

127
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:03,920
and anyone could talk to it.

128
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:06,209
And so we had to fix that very quickly.

129
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,130
You had to pull a Westworld on that poor bot.

130
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,260
I'm not familiar with what that means, but I'll

131
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,000
-- assume. Yes,
-- you haven't seen Westworld.

132
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,380
I don't have HBO. I barely watch TV.

133
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,000
Honestly,

134
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:16,839
Gilmore

135
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,890
-- Girls, though,
-- we'll

136
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:18,380
-- talk
-- about it.

137
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,130
We'll talk about Westworld on a different episode.

138
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:21,269
I'll make

139
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:21,540
it

140
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,059
-- back
-- to Santa.

141
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:27,809
Um So, yeah, so he's got this huge surveillance apparatus,

142
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,190
I guess for lack of a better word.

143
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,059
And what's interesting to me is he's, he's gone technological, right?

144
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,820
Like it used to be, parents had to

145
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,540
send in the information, right?

146
00:05:35,549 --> 00:05:37,019
And as I understand it, Santa now, you know,

147
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:40,220
has remote monitoring capabilities with these elves on the shelves and,

148
00:05:40,929 --> 00:05:42,040
you know, I'm pretty sure

149
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:42,950
um, well,

150
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,720
there was actually the case of um some of these new children's toys that take

151
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,839
like voice input and kind of talk back. Apparently.

152
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,739
Uh This obviously is done in like a cloud back end in some cases,

153
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,059
like it's not done on the toy

154
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,190
that it's like Siri,

155
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,100
it sends it back to somewhere for processing and then generates a response.

156
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:04,320
And apparently one of the companies doing this is like part of a defense contractor.

157
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:05,519
Conglomeration.

158
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:06,970
Nice,

159
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,709
you know, like, um

160
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,980
yeah, it's just, it's,

161
00:06:10,109 --> 00:06:13,779
the future is far weirder than I could have ever imagined.

162
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,619
You know, like you read Cypherpunk or, or

163
00:06:15,739 --> 00:06:19,320
sorry, cyberpunk, you know, genre stuff or even cypherpunk stuff. And

164
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,399
man, they, they really got it wrong like we,

165
00:06:22,869 --> 00:06:26,690
yeah, we seem to have willingly taken on all this, you know, surveillance

166
00:06:26,989 --> 00:06:27,290
and

167
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,600
the dawn to our kids or

168
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:29,589
Orwell

169
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:31,739
and Huxley got it pretty good,

170
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,779
I'd say.

171
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:33,839
Yeah. Yeah.

172
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:38,839
You know, it's, it's not AAA mirror, it's just Facebook on your mobile phone, which,

173
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,459
you know, is better because it's in your pocket.

174
00:06:40,739 --> 00:06:42,369
That's right. It's Oh man.

175
00:06:43,929 --> 00:06:48,510
So, ok, so, so let's focus. Santa has the largest surveillance network

176
00:06:48,769 --> 00:06:51,959
on the planet without doubt, right. Did Santa have Santa lines?

177
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,239
-- I don't think I've ever really found anything that says he
-- does

178
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,399
wonder about it because I,

179
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:59,670
I know on Google Maps now they have the Santa tracking app shown up,

180
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,600
it showed up in

181
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:02,239
Google

182
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,579
in Maps about

183
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:03,750
a

184
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:03,880
week

185
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:04,010
ago.

186
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,100
Well, or yeah, I mean, I don't know if he's,

187
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,989
I don't see, that's what I wonder is,

188
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,799
is Santa cooperating with NORAD or is this

189
00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:15,829
like like an actual like potentially hostile flight?

190
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:18,540
-- Which is why they track him?
-- No. Do you know why they track Santa?

191
00:07:18,549 --> 00:07:20,299
The story is amazing actually.

192
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,000
So no, there's a story behind it. So, so what

193
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:23,380
-- happened
-- in

194
00:07:23,489 --> 00:07:24,850
airline disaster documentaries

195
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:28,760
-- as well? No,
-- it does. It does. This is a happy story.

196
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:32,250
Yeah. And don't oh man, those airline disaster things are terrified anyway.

197
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,809
So, so here's the deal is

198
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,350
long ago.

199
00:07:35,609 --> 00:07:39,609
There was a, I believe it was a radio station, put an ad in the newspaper saying,

200
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,980
you know, find out where Santa is or talk to Santa or something like that call,

201
00:07:43,989 --> 00:07:45,109
this phone number, right?

202
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,779
And they put the wrong phone number,

203
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:52,510
they were one digit off and the phone number they put in was for NORAD.

204
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:56,500
And so these little kids kept calling NORAD and in the first couple of calls,

205
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,260
I imagine they were like, what the heck is going on.

206
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,209
But they started playing along. Right.

207
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,510
And they were talking to kids and telling

208
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,559
them all about Santa and the tracking of Santa

209
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,160
and apparently it was so popular and they had so much

210
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,679
fun doing it that they decided after that every year they

211
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,209
were going to track Santa and let's face it if any

212
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,679
organization other than Google is best equipped to track Santa,

213
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,549
it's NORAD.

214
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:16,959
Right.

215
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:17,839
Yeah.

216
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,200
Yeah, they got the satellites, the, the distant early warning line.

217
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,450
Right.

218
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,890
Yeah, all that stuff.

219
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,730
Well, I mean, he comes, you know, he's taking the same ballistic track as a missile,

220
00:08:27,739 --> 00:08:30,000
you know, coming from the North Pole over to the US.

221
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:30,329
So.

222
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:31,089
Right,

223
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:32,630
because he,

224
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:37,299
he visits the other parts of the world too. Right.

225
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,808
Visiting, um, we'll say wealthy countries first

226
00:08:39,989 --> 00:08:41,190
and, and probably

227
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:41,479
as

228
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,869
he followed the Dateline.

229
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,849
Yeah, that's, well, if you, if you track Santa on the no

230
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:49,130
website, he actually does that where he obviously starts out in,

231
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:51,690
uh, Australia and Asia

232
00:08:51,969 --> 00:08:56,000
and then works his way across the planet until he obviously hits

233
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,619
North America and then we can all start telling our kids to,

234
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,989
you know,

235
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:02,460
go to f, to sleep because Santa won't come if you don't.

236
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,679
Yeah.

237
00:09:05,859 --> 00:09:07,150
Yeah, I know. It's, uh,

238
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:11,520
so I would assume he probably has, like, maybe a transponder on his sleigh, you know,

239
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,510
to play along because, you know,

240
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,390
you don't wanna get sucked into a 747 flying out of Melbourne.

241
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:15,919
Right.

242
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,630
That's a good point.

243
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,460
I wonder if there's ever been a, uh, well,

244
00:09:19,469 --> 00:09:21,510
you've been watching aircraft disaster shows.

245
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,830
Has Santa ever collided with a commercial aircraft?

246
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:25,070
To

247
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,260
the

248
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,229
best of my knowledge,

249
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,440
to me that at

250
00:09:27,729 --> 00:09:31,500
least in the US, he'd be flying in unrestricted airspace below 500 ft.

251
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,030
Do we know how high Santa flies though? I mean, I guess he has to come down

252
00:09:36,369 --> 00:09:36,869
but

253
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,590
when he crosses the ocean,

254
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,820
you know, Google probably knows.

255
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:44,359
But what's the altitude limit on a, on a reindeer before they, like, pass out 2 ft.

256
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,330
But, I mean,

257
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,210
technically if he's going from house to house

258
00:09:49,219 --> 00:09:51,280
and not like long haul across the Pacific,

259
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:53,289
he should be, I would imagine staying low.

260
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,890
Right. Like he's not gonna

261
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,219
fare and, oh, you know, that's a good point.

262
00:09:57,229 --> 00:10:01,849
Actually, the, the way that the, the planet works out is quite nice because he,

263
00:10:01,859 --> 00:10:04,710
although he's got to hit a bunch of those little islands in the Pacific because,

264
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:07,510
like, people don't realize how big the Pacific Ocean is.

265
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,289
Like, it's half the planet.

266
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:10,010
I mean,

267
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,030
it's crazy.

268
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:13,049
And so you've got to think, I bet the, uh,

269
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:15,700
the return on investment of hitting those like remote

270
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,450
islands with only a handful of people is,

271
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:21,890
is significantly high, given the terrible density of that whole side of the planet.

272
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:22,590
So,

273
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,210
so, yeah, Santa His,

274
00:10:24,719 --> 00:10:28,729
uh, the economics of this are clearly not done very well. Right.

275
00:10:28,739 --> 00:10:33,340
I, I suspect that Amazon does not have prime in, in American Samoa

276
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,440
or Tuvalu.

277
00:10:34,869 --> 00:10:35,330
Right.

278
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:38,630
Well, I feel bad for these, you know,

279
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,989
small places and not only are they small and out of the way, but now they're, you know,

280
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,510
being

281
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,890
ending up under the ocean. And

282
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:48,510
I think one of these uh van who was seriously talking about relocating

283
00:10:48,619 --> 00:10:49,549
to Australia,

284
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:53,450
-- they don't really have a choice,
-- I suppose.

285
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:58,070
And you got to think uh the North Pole is not a land mass, it is an ice sheet.

286
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:00,690
And so Santa is gonna have some troubles

287
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,909
if, if that ever uh melts,

288
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:05,640
-- right? Maybe now Santa will use a boat instead
-- of

289
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,270
assumed that he has some sort of extra dimensional portal type technology.

290
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:10,409
Well,

291
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,299
then why does he fly in a freaking sleigh

292
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:15,070
instead of just appearing in your home magically deposit?

293
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,530
Well, I guess he kind of does. We'll get to that.

294
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,780
Like I always assumed he had some form of portal gun

295
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:22,469
because you know what if you don't have a chimney.

296
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:22,580
Uh,

297
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:25,669
you have to be in sight with the portal gun and

298
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,349
you can only shoot it onto a lunar dust coated surfaces.

299
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:32,770
Yeah. Yeah, I've never played the game. Oh

300
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:33,489
man.

301
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,159
Portal is fanta actually Portal one you have to

302
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:38,590
play just to understand kind of what's happening.

303
00:11:38,599 --> 00:11:41,570
And then Portal two, they cover a bunch of history behind

304
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,710
the facility that the portal people. It's called the Aperture Labs.

305
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:47,429
It's, it's really good

306
00:11:47,729 --> 00:11:52,210
just for honestly, for the story of the second one I think is, is phenomenal.

307
00:11:52,219 --> 00:11:52,929
And I had more,

308
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,489
I get more enjoyment from that than I do from actually playing the game.

309
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,280
But I do love the portal games. They're, they're fantastic games.

310
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:58,960
Yeah.

311
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,760
So let's just assume for a moment that we'll,

312
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,049
we'll just pretend the travel thing works out.

313
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:05,570
I

314
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,219
-- think you have to
-- accept the

315
00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:08,049
Sonic booms.

316
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:12,250
-- Don't just flatten the entire planet every 24 or once a year
-- or does

317
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:18,679
he have some sort of space time device that allows him to stop time

318
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,919
or warp space or some combination of the two?

319
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,469
Yeah.

320
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,690
So, but moving around.

321
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:25,070
So

322
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:28,409
he's got this. Yeah. Well, you know, it's like a lot of things in life.

323
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:30,450
I mean, I, my car works when I turn it on.

324
00:12:30,739 --> 00:12:34,200
Really? Do I do? I know how it works when it turns on. No,

325
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:35,619
no, I really don't.

326
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,099
There's fire inside and then things go.

327
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,750
Exactly.

328
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,179
So he's got this huge surveillance database.

329
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,210
Now, this is, this is kind of interesting to me because

330
00:12:44,349 --> 00:12:46,030
I remember back in the day when having

331
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:49,260
like large databases was a very nontrivial problem.

332
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,500
Like, I remember the excitement of I was working for a government agency

333
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,919
and they got a Dell server

334
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,900
with quad CP us

335
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,460
256 megabytes of RA M

336
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:04,039
and something like 27 gigabytes of storage in

337
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:09,039
two enormous external cases hooked up through like, and this is the weirdest part,

338
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:12,359
they had dual scuzzy cards so that if one card failed, they could still,

339
00:13:12,369 --> 00:13:13,640
it would still work,

340
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:14,840
you know,

341
00:13:15,049 --> 00:13:17,450
and, and the size of these cables, right?

342
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,510
They were like half an inch, they were just massive cables,

343
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,359
you know, with a bend radius.

344
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:23,320
Um

345
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:24,789
And you know,

346
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:27,809
I remember they made me carry one of the towers and I really didn't want to because I

347
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,309
didn't want to drop it because it was basically

348
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,479
worth like my salary for the next decade.

349
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:32,880
Um

350
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:36,880
But, and you know, I remember being so impressed with it and now, I mean, well,

351
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:40,229
uh as an example of scale, you know, let's let's assume right?

352
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:41,690
7 billion people on the planet. Uh

353
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:45,380
We're looking at probably a megabyte of data,

354
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,890
-- a piece because
-- maybe that depends what he tracks though.

355
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,640
If he's tracking any sort of graphics, any images,

356
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,770
full motion video man is crazy

357
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:55,650
so

358
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,559
well. But one megabyte,

359
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,840
-- you
-- know, just locational data because some people live and there's no address.

360
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:02,369
Uh, that's true,

361
00:14:02,729 --> 00:14:03,229
you know.

362
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:07,260
Um, anyway, so let's assume a megabyte each because it's easy math.

363
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,570
That's, that's seven by petabytes of data,

364
00:14:09,869 --> 00:14:10,530
right? Which,

365
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:12,330
you know, used to sound like a lot.

366
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:16,000
But, um, I mean, yeah, last week and, and this makes me wonder if they're kind of in

367
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:20,369
cahoots. Amazon announced snowmobile, right? Like they originally had snowball,

368
00:14:20,474 --> 00:14:21,284
which was a couple, I

369
00:14:21,465 --> 00:14:23,525
think, tens or hundreds of terabytes in a,

370
00:14:23,534 --> 00:14:26,955
in a pack in a basically in a ruggedized case that they would ship to you.

371
00:14:26,965 --> 00:14:28,614
You put your data on it, you ship it back to them

372
00:14:29,164 --> 00:14:33,864
and now they have snowmobile which is up to 100 petabytes and it literally,

373
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:37,294
-- it's a 45 ft shipping container full of hard drives,
-- which is crazy.

374
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:38,390
Yeah.

375
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,669
And like there's even an option for an armed escort if you want,

376
00:14:41,719 --> 00:14:46,010
-- which
-- I assume Santa would need that because there's probably various,

377
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,099
uh we'll say government organizations that would be

378
00:14:48,109 --> 00:14:51,150
very interested in acquiring copies of his data.

379
00:14:51,409 --> 00:14:51,530
Well,

380
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:54,270
just think about what you've probably done in the last year that nobody knows about.

381
00:14:54,549 --> 00:14:55,770
Santa knows. Right.

382
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:58,549
He keeps the list, I hear he checks it twice.

383
00:14:58,669 --> 00:14:58,869
Yeah.

384
00:14:58,969 --> 00:15:01,429
So, well, and you know, it's good that he does data integrity. That's

385
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:01,770
true.

386
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,659
-- That's
-- true. And if he

387
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,580
maybe he has two megabytes of data on all of us.

388
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,330
So,

389
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:06,940
but yeah, I can't help wonder.

390
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:11,710
But, you know, like these massive data storage projects, snowball and snowmobile.

391
00:15:12,969 --> 00:15:15,599
Yeah, that's true. It checks out, checks out

392
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:17,340
-- because you gotta
-- think, right?

393
00:15:17,479 --> 00:15:20,770
A lot of like the reason we have integrated circuits is because of the, you know,

394
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,500
the Apollo Moon Pro uh Project, right?

395
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:26,000
You know, miniaturized computers and, you know,

396
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,419
things like data storage again from the military, right?

397
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:31,510
So I can't help but wonder is Santa essentially

398
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,460
a technology incubator as well for surveillance technology?

399
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,340
-- So
-- are you suggesting that Santa is part of the military?

400
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:41,159
Well, not directly part of the military but, but like the military,

401
00:15:41,169 --> 00:15:43,630
he develops technology that nobody else would be willing to spend the money.

402
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,059
-- I understand.
-- I understand.

403
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,380
I got you, I got you.

404
00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:50,580
Well, you, you look at Futurama and Santa is definitely militarized there, right?

405
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,570
-- But he means,
-- well,

406
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,460
no, he doesn't. His goal is to

407
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:58,750
-- he's there to murder everybody. He doesn't mean
-- well at all, only the bad people,

408
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,929
all of the people Kurt in Futurama.

409
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,169
Yeah. Yeah.

410
00:16:02,179 --> 00:16:03,859
So, so for those of you who have never seen it,

411
00:16:03,869 --> 00:16:06,580
watch the Futurama Christmas episodes because they are awesome.

412
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:08,900
But essentially according to the show.

413
00:16:09,049 --> 00:16:10,739
And if, if, if none of you know,

414
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,080
I'm like an insane Futurama fan to the point

415
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,539
of I can generally tell you the episode names,

416
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:18,849
if you tell me what happens in them off the top of my head, which is disturbing.

417
00:16:18,859 --> 00:16:20,979
Anyway. So in the Christmas episodes,

418
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:26,080
they, they talk about Santa was built in like 2030 no, 2020.

419
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,289
I forget what year it was, it was in 20 something or other.

420
00:16:28,299 --> 00:16:29,890
They're in the year 3000 in the show.

421
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,619
Basically, when he was programmed, they made his uh naughty

422
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:35,349
algorithm

423
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:39,859
too sensitive. So he's determined everyone is naughty. Actually, except Dr

424
00:16:39,989 --> 00:16:40,340
Zoidberg. Dr

425
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:43,190
Zoidberg gets a pogo stick in one of the episodes because

426
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,500
he's not naughty but everyone else is naughty and Santa uh,

427
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:49,000
kills them or, or hurts them badly.

428
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:49,690
We'll say

429
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,229
as, as part of his.

430
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:55,179
Yeah, it's, it's really funny. I love those episodes

431
00:16:55,609 --> 00:16:55,869
and,

432
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:58,609
uh, Bender becomes Santa in one of the episodes as well,

433
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:03,909
which is one of the best ones ever because then, uh, that's the one where they, they,

434
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:05,858
uh, Santa comes in and they've got, uh, Doctor

435
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,290
Zberg shows up as, as,

436
00:17:07,618 --> 00:17:09,530
and I'm, I'm Santa's friend Jesus.

437
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,750
Right. And it's, it's really good anyway. Anyway.

438
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:17,589
Uh, right. So we know Santa has an impressive surveillance network he has

439
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,030
and he would have to as well for his, uh, for his supply chain.

440
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,640
It's true. Oh, that's true. We could hit supply chain.

441
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:23,780
I

442
00:17:23,969 --> 00:17:24,180
mean,

443
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:24,760
it's

444
00:17:25,229 --> 00:17:25,780
because

445
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,979
I, I, you know, you think Amazon is big and ships a lot of stuff. I mean,

446
00:17:30,739 --> 00:17:32,800
you know, can you imagine if you told Amazon? Oh, yeah.

447
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:36,260
And by the way, you only get to deliver for 1 24 hour period every year.

448
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,020
That would, that's not Amazon's problem. That's fedex's problem. Right.

449
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,930
Speaking of, I was at the Lego store, I was shop,

450
00:17:47,939 --> 00:17:49,530
I was looking at the Lego store the other day

451
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,709
and they, they, they take,

452
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:54,349
they take orders up until December, I think 15th

453
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,810
and then not until February 1st,

454
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,290
I get that. I bet.

455
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:02,410
I don't know if, if the, the shipping companies changed the rates in any way.

456
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,739
But if I was a shipping company

457
00:18:03,989 --> 00:18:06,180
I would make it significantly more expensive

458
00:18:06,189 --> 00:18:08,130
to ship something after December 15th.

459
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:08,810
Yeah.

460
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,050
So, but yeah, I mean, you would have to have surveillance. I mean,

461
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:14,209
part of me wonders though, if you're,

462
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:17,369
if you're an Elf living at the North pole or in some extra dimensional

463
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:19,209
thing tied to the North pole,

464
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:23,400
for example, you steal children's toys. Like how do

465
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:26,660
you, how do you sell them? How do you get rid of them? Like, what do you do with them?

466
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,459
Look, you're talking about a being

467
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,920
that already knows everything about everyone.

468
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:34,040
He's gonna know you stole toys from him

469
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,290
and I would assume aren't

470
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,109
people?

471
00:18:36,569 --> 00:18:36,849
Uh Oh,

472
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:40,750
that's true. They does seem to track his elves.

473
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,790
And let's assume

474
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:49,589
he does though because why would you not track your indentured servants

475
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,780
who are building and running your empire?

476
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,670
Right. That would be a completely foolish mistake.

477
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,099
And in fact, it would be very much like game of Thrones, right?

478
00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:01,510
Where you'd have a constant, we'll say

479
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,550
attempts on your life as Santa by the various Elf

480
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,349
minions who you do not track in any reasonable way.

481
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:09,109
Yeah.

482
00:19:09,219 --> 00:19:11,810
I always thought things like that would be impossible because you know,

483
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:14,390
how could you have like a clearly insane leader,

484
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,189
like leading something doing crazy things?

485
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:20,430
And I hate to say it, but every time that topic comes up, I just think of North Korea.

486
00:19:21,339 --> 00:19:24,160
Are, are you suggesting Santa is insane?

487
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,290
Well, I mean,

488
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:27,900
I want to

489
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,729
pay the elves. Does he treat them well?

490
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:34,530
From a lot of documentaries we've seen like Futurama, for example, makes it very

491
00:19:34,829 --> 00:19:35,780
clear the elves are not,

492
00:19:36,069 --> 00:19:37,260
they're not elves, they're neps.

493
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:41,439
Yes, it's totally different there in those. That's a robot.

494
00:19:41,449 --> 00:19:43,359
Santa that was built probably as

495
00:19:43,459 --> 00:19:46,640
when the real Santa was. I, I wonder what happened to the real Santa?

496
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:47,640
Actually, it's interesting.

497
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:50,000
However, now if you look at most,

498
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:55,040
we'll say child appropriate television and movies that involve Santa,

499
00:19:55,339 --> 00:20:00,109
he appears to treat his elves with a certain amount of love and respect

500
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,089
versus I

501
00:20:01,189 --> 00:20:01,310
guess

502
00:20:01,469 --> 00:20:04,290
the movie Elf, which we could take as canon because it's

503
00:20:04,939 --> 00:20:07,589
sure we'll call that Cannon. The movie Elf is Cannon. All right, folks.

504
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:08,310
You heard it here.

505
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,160
So,

506
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:15,619
yes. And in the movie Elf, uh Santa is nice to the elves and treats them well. Right.

507
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:21,520
And is even willing to pretend a human is an Elf for much longer than they should have.

508
00:20:23,979 --> 00:20:26,439
Yeah. No, I've always wondered about that because the whole

509
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:30,319
sort of the, the this gift based economy that he runs,

510
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:33,920
-- you know, I mean, I'm imagining does he have, it's not
-- an economy, Kurt,

511
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,040
it's pure output.

512
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,079
Where's the input to this? Right? Milk and cookies? I mean,

513
00:20:38,209 --> 00:20:38,650
well,

514
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,189
you know what

515
00:20:40,209 --> 00:20:43,000
I think actually now that you bring up the milk and cookies issue,

516
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,489
looping back to travel, I think there may be a thing there.

517
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:45,760
Um,

518
00:20:46,189 --> 00:20:49,199
-- because also back to the future is Canon, I believe,
-- of course it is,

519
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:50,920
you know, Mr

520
00:20:51,089 --> 00:20:53,849
Fusion, right? You, you, you gotta, you gotta put something in the Mr

521
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,239
Fusion drive to fuel it

522
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,180
and maybe milk and cookies are the optimal fusion fuel.

523
00:21:00,189 --> 00:21:02,810
But his, his sleigh is powered by

524
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:04,829
eight, maybe nine. Reindeer

525
00:21:05,969 --> 00:21:06,380
Reindeer

526
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,140
grass. That's

527
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:08,819
a

528
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,650
good question.

529
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:13,410
I would imagine these Reindeer are like a little bit, you know, they,

530
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,209
they've had some custom modifications, right?

531
00:21:15,219 --> 00:21:17,489
They can fly. Rudolph has a red nose.

532
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:23,479
Um, if we look at, for example, taking, um, Ice Age the Christmas episode

533
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:24,849
again as cannon,

534
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,810
you know,

535
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,010
uh Blitzen can make lightning.

536
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:31,579
So he's got like some sort of electrostatic weapon which when you think about it,

537
00:21:31,589 --> 00:21:32,849
true, they would also need,

538
00:21:33,109 --> 00:21:33,380
right?

539
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,199
Because like what if they fly into a flock of geese, you know,

540
00:21:35,209 --> 00:21:36,729
you don't want to take a geese in the engine and

541
00:21:37,099 --> 00:21:40,199
-- you know, crack,
-- they don't have engines, they're deer.

542
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:44,520
No, but if you take like a goose to the face at like 300 miles an hour, it's gonna hurt,

543
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:47,770
I would think. So. It hurt the guy in front.

544
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,640
That's why it's probably good to be in the back. Right.

545
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,239
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah. Get that slipstream.

546
00:21:53,189 --> 00:21:53,959
It's about, uh,

547
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:58,290
yeah, I mean, you know, as we've learned from a variety of air accidents, you know,

548
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,650
like when you fly into a flock of birds it can end poorly.

549
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,430
-- So,
-- for example,

550
00:22:04,709 --> 00:22:05,290
that can,

551
00:22:05,989 --> 00:22:09,040
so, you know, like these reindeer I would imagine have some pretty, you know,

552
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,400
custom modifications,

553
00:22:11,449 --> 00:22:12,859
like to deal with these situations.

554
00:22:13,729 --> 00:22:15,800
Well, dealing with turbulence because for example,

555
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:18,199
there's some pretty fragile gifts coming through the system,

556
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,270
right? People give people get puppies for Christmas,

557
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:24,910
right? I wonder how they build those.

558
00:22:25,699 --> 00:22:29,199
Well, you, you just, I, I would assume he just has like

559
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:31,459
Santa Puppy Mill

560
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:32,880
basically,

561
00:22:33,489 --> 00:22:34,430
you know, I mean,

562
00:22:34,709 --> 00:22:35,040
it's,

563
00:22:35,699 --> 00:22:36,920
I, well, well,

564
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,699
this also assumes that he does everything and just

565
00:22:38,709 --> 00:22:41,050
-- hasn't outsourced it at some point without telling
-- us

566
00:22:41,189 --> 00:22:43,140
he has outsourced it and

567
00:22:43,369 --> 00:22:46,079
we'll get to that that towards the end. But,

568
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:46,739
yeah.

569
00:22:47,219 --> 00:22:51,400
All right. All right. So we've decided that reindeer are possibly

570
00:22:52,199 --> 00:22:53,520
fueled by milk and cookies.

571
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:56,349
However, I don't know if this is a tradition where you live, but where I'm at,

572
00:22:56,459 --> 00:23:00,819
you leave out milk and cookies for Santa and also carrots for the reindeer.

573
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:02,819
Right. True.

574
00:23:02,829 --> 00:23:03,430
Yeah, we do,

575
00:23:03,439 --> 00:23:05,709
we do the Saint Nicholas thing because we're well of

576
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:08,189
German descent and so Saint Nick comes around on,

577
00:23:08,199 --> 00:23:09,520
I think it's December the fifth and it's kind

578
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,170
of like a practice warm up for Christmas.

579
00:23:11,989 --> 00:23:13,439
Uh So you basically get a warning

580
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,239
and a little toy for good or

581
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:15,770
a

582
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:16,660
bad. What do you

583
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,479
-- do? You give ST Nicholas a gift? You leave
-- a carrot for his, um

584
00:23:21,589 --> 00:23:22,589
I want to say donkey,

585
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,910
he has a donkey

586
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,819
and you only leave the carrot for the donkey. You don't leave anything for

587
00:23:28,489 --> 00:23:30,229
because Saint Nicholas is a nice guy.

588
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:30,530
I

589
00:23:30,729 --> 00:23:30,750
see.

590
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:31,000
I

591
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:31,359
see.

592
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:31,719
Unlike

593
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:32,290
Santa who

594
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:32,410
is

595
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:32,780
just ignore

596
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,439
the slavery

597
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:33,810
does.

598
00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:35,959
Oh, yeah.

599
00:23:36,209 --> 00:23:36,339
OK.

600
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:39,260
Well,

601
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:43,160
that's uh actually there's David Sedaris has a little thing he

602
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,900
gives where he talks about Christmas and whatnot around the world

603
00:23:46,089 --> 00:23:49,119
and he gets one where I, I forget which country it's in.

604
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:49,859
But

605
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,020
there's Santa with uh yeah,

606
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,719
three slaves essentially followed him around according to their traditions,

607
00:23:55,839 --> 00:24:00,260
which is, of course, when, when he does it, it's hilarious as all of his things are.

608
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,719
But I'll, I'll put that in the show notes. I'll, I'll dig it up.

609
00:24:02,729 --> 00:24:05,069
But it, it's fantastic. So, anyway, OK, so

610
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:09,589
maybe milk and cookies feel reindeer. Maybe they don't, we don't know for sure.

611
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:10,060
However,

612
00:24:10,069 --> 00:24:14,150
we do know that vast quantities of milk are consumed

613
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,810
on Christmas Eve and a large number of cookies are eaten

614
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:21,530
and they are for something. We don't know the purpose. We'll say

615
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,689
maybe fuel, maybe that's

616
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:27,329
how their economy works. Presents come out. Cookies go in.

617
00:24:27,689 --> 00:24:28,819
I don't know the details.

618
00:24:28,829 --> 00:24:31,449
You know that would work with, I mean, that would work with Children.

619
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:35,199
I know my kids are, you know, highly motivated by cookies as currency,

620
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:38,400
you know, and Skittles and M, and M's even

621
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,189
candy. Candy, candy works on me, man. I'm not gonna lie. I'll do anything for candy.

622
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:46,290
Well, I mean, uh, look at the, what is it? The US Senate.

623
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,109
There's a, traditionally,

624
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:50,640
there's one desk towards the front that's full of candy and it's, I think the Senate

625
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:51,819
minority whips.

626
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:54,939
Yeah, there's some, it's some tradition where they have like, just, yeah,

627
00:24:54,949 --> 00:24:56,359
they have a desk full of candy.

628
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,069
-- Now,
-- I'm super

629
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,959
interested in being a senator

630
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,959
just for my free candy. Right. That's totally the right reason to do it,

631
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:05,079
which is probably actually a better reason than

632
00:25:05,089 --> 00:25:06,709
most of those guys got into the Senate

633
00:25:08,989 --> 00:25:11,530
about American. So I can't really say, speak to that. But,

634
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,150
so we've established.

635
00:25:13,439 --> 00:25:17,079
So I guess that we got to really come back to the, how does he actually, that,

636
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:20,359
that classic problem, the last mile delivery problem

637
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,000
breaking an en,

638
00:25:22,199 --> 00:25:23,709
right. He's a master thief.

639
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,199
He sees

640
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,530
into your house, steals your milk and cookies

641
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,310
and, and leaves behind gifts.

642
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,630
Well, is there an implied contract with the milk and cookies?

643
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:34,150
There's an offer given,

644
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:35,589
there's the offer

645
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:37,709
taken and there's the,

646
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,369
the, the reciprocation. So,

647
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:41,520
uh,

648
00:25:41,719 --> 00:25:46,050
I'm wondering because, you know, a lot of law works on historical precedent,

649
00:25:46,489 --> 00:25:47,859
right? Cases and so on

650
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:48,479
and

651
00:25:49,469 --> 00:25:52,359
gets you the gifts. Right. Not the milk and cookies.

652
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:56,839
I would see the milk and cookies as more of the, uh, tip for a job. Well done.

653
00:25:56,849 --> 00:25:57,839
Hopefully. Right.

654
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:02,800
-- I guess we'd have to look that up. I don't know the
-- historical Santa Law.

655
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:03,689
I

656
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,640
bet that's covered in the Library of Congress.

657
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,839
Well, I'm kind of wondering too, like, you know,

658
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:11,170
when you buy a house, did you read all the paperwork that came with it?

659
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,800
I read a lot of it

660
00:26:13,199 --> 00:26:13,510
but

661
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:15,449
I know what you mean.

662
00:26:15,489 --> 00:26:16,920
I've often wondered because, like, you know, with,

663
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:20,719
with various products now there's user license agreements that, you know,

664
00:26:20,729 --> 00:26:23,280
essentially have all sorts of crazy conditions.

665
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:23,660
Um,

666
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:27,000
you know, like some of them are just

667
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,400
absurd. Now.

668
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:32,520
-- Um,
-- now, now those I will admit I never read

669
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,500
and

670
00:26:33,699 --> 00:26:33,719
I,

671
00:26:33,729 --> 00:26:36,150
I read some research one time that said if you read

672
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,800
every UL A you're presented to be it from like,

673
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:43,140
apps and software and, and whatever services online, whatever, what not, you know,

674
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,170
it would take something like

675
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:51,239
a month or two of your life every year just to read them all. Which is crazy.

676
00:26:52,369 --> 00:26:52,939
Yeah,

677
00:26:53,189 --> 00:26:55,939
I've often wondered about that because he, he obviously,

678
00:26:56,459 --> 00:26:58,550
you know, the, the police don't seem too concerned.

679
00:26:58,949 --> 00:27:01,140
Are they powerless or are they part of this?

680
00:27:01,969 --> 00:27:04,640
Well, yeah, that's a good question.

681
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,880
I mean, I really, I really do wonder about this sometimes.

682
00:27:09,939 --> 00:27:12,469
Well, however, in the movie, the Santa Claus,

683
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,729
they arrest Santa and then there's a special

684
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:18,849
elf, like, like special ops unit

685
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:23,349
that comes and frees him and clearly, if you have a special ops elf unit,

686
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,310
this is not the first time Santa has found himself,

687
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:28,109
we'll say on the wrong side of the law,

688
00:27:28,489 --> 00:27:31,270
-- but
-- he also delivers presents to some dangerous places.

689
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:34,229
Uh That is true.

690
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:36,189
That is true. Like Chicago,

691
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:39,050
I shouldn't laugh.

692
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,560
It's sadly not funny.

693
00:27:40,939 --> 00:27:41,380
But

694
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:41,920
yeah.

695
00:27:42,589 --> 00:27:46,280
So, I mean, well, I guess also part of it boils down to like there's been cases where,

696
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:46,650
you know,

697
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:50,660
um, for example, if somebody comes onto your property to put a fire out,

698
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,489
you're not going to charge them with trespassing.

699
00:27:52,569 --> 00:27:54,150
Could you, you could, I don't know, in

700
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,439
theory you could, but

701
00:27:55,579 --> 00:27:57,739
I mean, they might also be covered by good Samaritan law. So

702
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:01,000
there's a thought is Santa covered by good Samaritan laws.

703
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:01,760
Uh

704
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,839
That's a good question.

705
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:06,829
We need, we're gonna need legal counsel next year for our Santa.

706
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:12,859
I imagine it's a lot like bird law. Like, are there people that practice Santa law?

707
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,319
It's got to be international.

708
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:15,880
So

709
00:28:16,449 --> 00:28:18,569
-- right there, super complicated.
-- It's true.

710
00:28:18,579 --> 00:28:20,290
It's true and not only international,

711
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,079
but it's going to have tons of historical precedent

712
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,239
just given the fact that that Santa has been around for hundreds

713
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,670
thousands might be pushing it, but certainly hundreds of years.

714
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:37,319
I, I know, I think I'm pretty sure Christmas has been celebrated for quite some time

715
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:39,000
and the gift giving seems to

716
00:28:40,729 --> 00:28:43,910
Well, I think humans have given gifts probably forever.

717
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:44,430
Right.

718
00:28:45,209 --> 00:28:46,270
That's certainly not new.

719
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,760
-- Yeah. So it goes back about 2000 years, 2000
-- years of Santa.

720
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:52,819
That's crazy.

721
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,339
Yeah.

722
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,349
Potentially.

723
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,400
Yeah. Wow. The Romans, yeah. Started with the Romans. Like many things.

724
00:29:00,709 --> 00:29:03,479
Even the Greeks. What? The Greeks and the Romans? Ok.

725
00:29:03,489 --> 00:29:06,219
-- Well, yeah, it still goes back like, all the way.
-- Nice.

726
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,390
That's crazy. Man.

727
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,780
Took quite some time.

728
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:10,810
Sorry. I've lost the show. Ah, there we go.

729
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,459
Um,

730
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,219
yeah, because, I mean,

731
00:29:13,229 --> 00:29:14,349
and the other thing that gets me is he

732
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:17,530
breaks and enters without actually typically doing much damage,

733
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:20,680
uh, to my knowledge, he does no damage at all. And

734
00:29:20,979 --> 00:29:22,410
so, historically speaking,

735
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,959
he would come down the chimney and every house used to have a chimney,

736
00:29:24,969 --> 00:29:26,069
but these days that's a

737
00:29:26,219 --> 00:29:28,359
little more suspect than it used to be.

738
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:32,119
Well, most houses have dryer vents or a furnace.

739
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,280
Uh, yes. Yes. Everyone's house has ways in, we'll say.

740
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:38,339
But,

741
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:42,280
but, but at the same time, if Santa's coming in through your dryer vent,

742
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:43,660
that's,

743
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,939
that's a pretty indirect route, right?

744
00:29:45,949 --> 00:29:49,550
If you have the ability to make it through that, why not just, like, open the door,

745
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:49,760
right?

746
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:53,010
You clearly have the ability to do amazing things.

747
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:57,290
Well, I mean, thinking back to that X Files episode

748
00:29:57,589 --> 00:30:00,400
with the, uh, the guy that could contort himself.

749
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,579
I don't remember that one, but I have not watched X Files in probably 20

750
00:30:04,689 --> 00:30:08,160
-- years.
-- It's been a while. They're rebooting it apparently.

751
00:30:08,479 --> 00:30:11,770
But uh back to Santa Claus. Hey, did the X files ever do anything on Santa?

752
00:30:12,369 --> 00:30:12,459
That

753
00:30:12,709 --> 00:30:13,689
don't know.

754
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,680
But because that would be good. Canon. I think

755
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:20,750
there was, wasn't there the, there was an episode where

756
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,089
someone dressed this? I'm not even gonna go there. I, I'm not gonna think about it.

757
00:30:24,099 --> 00:30:26,469
My brain can't handle this right now. All right. So, anyway,

758
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:28,719
you're thinking of the bank robbery episode? Maybe,

759
00:30:29,449 --> 00:30:29,979
maybe I

760
00:30:30,109 --> 00:30:30,260
think that

761
00:30:30,449 --> 00:30:30,599
was,

762
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:31,670
I don't know.

763
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:33,380
So, back to Santa, I mean,

764
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:36,630
so we've decided Santa Israel,

765
00:30:37,209 --> 00:30:37,880
he can deliver

766
00:30:39,329 --> 00:30:39,689
that.

767
00:30:39,849 --> 00:30:42,979
We've decided he has an impressive surveillance network.

768
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,209
Well, that's where, that's where we'll get to Santa as a service, right?

769
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:48,000
Which is clearly

770
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:52,560
what Santa has become. And he's done a marvelous job of that in, in modern dev

771
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,739
ops fashion, right?

772
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:58,750
I suppose. Yeah. So, so Santa is a service. Let's, let's walk through that.

773
00:30:59,579 --> 00:31:01,660
That's where you and I spend all our money on our

774
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:04,079
kids buying them crap they don't need so they can break it

775
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,160
and then complain about how much better Christmas was last year.

776
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,170
A

777
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:14,359
Yeah.

778
00:31:14,369 --> 00:31:18,729
No, I'm just, it's, it's amazing to me that it has become such an institution in,

779
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,869
but at the same time very different than I remember it as a kid.

780
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:25,589
And I don't know if that's because I was a child or because,

781
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:26,939
and I wasn't the one paying for it.

782
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:31,109
Well, it's ok, so society changes, obviously.

783
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:33,390
But there's also, I mean, it has become, like you said,

784
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,989
it's a huge institution now because there are so many organizations that

785
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,119
have so much riding on the holiday season because people do spend

786
00:31:41,229 --> 00:31:44,780
insane amounts of money on stuff. Right.

787
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:50,030
And this is actually where from the security angle, it's obviously very high risk

788
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:52,780
because, you know, it's kind of like why do people rob banks?

789
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,349
It's because of where the money is. Right.

790
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:58,069
Well, at the holidays, you know, there's people with money

791
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,150
everywhere

792
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,150
and I think that's,

793
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,250
you know, it's kind of like we had those, uh, with the, the,

794
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:06,189
a couple of shows ago we did the, the Cyber Monday advice.

795
00:32:06,449 --> 00:32:09,750
Yeah. Cyber Monday advice and, and the advice was terrible, but the point is,

796
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,150
people are at least aware

797
00:32:12,609 --> 00:32:14,530
that this is real and a threat.

798
00:32:15,089 --> 00:32:17,869
So I guess what would the threats around Santa be?

799
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,130
I mean,

800
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,329
apart from some random person breaking into your

801
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:22,489
house once a year to leave stuff behind.

802
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:23,170
Well,

803
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,910
it's clearly the massive amount of data he's

804
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,630
collected ever being hacked and leaked by,

805
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,829
you know, some organization which ironically,

806
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:35,969
I suspect Santa's database kind of falls under the same problem.

807
00:32:35,979 --> 00:32:37,390
You know, Google's database has,

808
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,800
is the only place you could put it after you stole it is back in Google.

809
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:43,280
So there's really nothing to do with it.

810
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,150
Right.

811
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,869
There's a thought security via

812
00:32:48,349 --> 00:32:49,800
obesity of data

813
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:52,199
security via obesity.

814
00:32:52,979 --> 00:32:55,569
Well, you know, like, it's like, um,

815
00:32:55,739 --> 00:32:57,550
well, it's like, it's like the pyramids, right?

816
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,089
Nobody's ever gonna steal the pyramids because they're just too dang big.

817
00:33:00,099 --> 00:33:01,630
But the Mona Lisa on the other hand,

818
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:02,719
small,

819
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,439
it's been stolen plenty of times.

820
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:09,060
But, but yeah, it has. Oh, it's got like a, a crazy history.

821
00:33:09,069 --> 00:33:11,750
I don't know if you ever, I've never seen it in person.

822
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,920
I've, I've never been to the Louver but

823
00:33:14,239 --> 00:33:19,119
if you look at it, the Mona Lisa is really small and the reason it's so tiny is because

824
00:33:19,219 --> 00:33:21,260
in many of the instances where they steal it,

825
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,619
they just literally cut it out of the frame and run.

826
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,089
And so obviously every time it was stolen it

827
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:28,219
got smaller and smaller for a period of time.

828
00:33:28,479 --> 00:33:29,810
And so now it's very tiny.

829
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,739
Why not just glue it to like a three inch thick piece of steel?

830
00:33:34,869 --> 00:33:37,250
Because that would probably ruin it. I would

831
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:38,650
imagine

832
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,329
that frame it on a three inch piece of steel.

833
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,160
It's framed.

834
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:45,819
Well, now it's, I won't say it's impossible to steal,

835
00:33:45,829 --> 00:33:49,449
but I suspect you're talking about like some serious movie plot

836
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,310
Antics

837
00:33:50,439 --> 00:33:51,969
to get a hold of that thing now.

838
00:33:52,949 --> 00:33:53,410
Yeah.

839
00:33:54,609 --> 00:33:55,489
Yeah. No, that's the thing.

840
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,449
Like I, yeah, if you look at a database, the size of Santa's database,

841
00:33:58,459 --> 00:33:59,430
like how would you,

842
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,069
I mean, there's a thought, you know,

843
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:06,000
with the facility it stored and even have enough bandwidth to move it out of there.

844
00:34:06,849 --> 00:34:07,650
Would you like li

845
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:11,280
literally have to drive a semi truck full of hard drives up to it and be like, uh,

846
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:12,429
don't mind me.

847
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,708
Right. What kind of, what kind of internet connection does the North Pole have?

848
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,290
Right. I mean,

849
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:19,110
fairly remote areas you would have to

850
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,649
-- because, I mean,
-- you could run, you could run fiber.

851
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:23,688
There's no land.

852
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:25,197
It's an ice

853
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:25,529
sheet.

854
00:34:26,529 --> 00:34:27,089
Is,

855
00:34:27,259 --> 00:34:30,589
is the north pole connected to a land mass

856
00:34:30,697 --> 00:34:32,309
that, well, the ice sheet is,

857
00:34:32,978 --> 00:34:34,840
that's why we don't have the northwest passage,

858
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,719
right? The, the ice sheet comes down.

859
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,580
It's, yeah, it's coming soon, sadly. But, um,

860
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:45,989
no, traditionally the North Pole ice sheets, they did retreat in summer,

861
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,830
but they were still.

862
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:47,409
-- No, no,
-- no.

863
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:50,070
But you could lay the cable on the ocean floor

864
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,030
right down underneath the ice and then bring it up

865
00:34:53,228 --> 00:34:56,110
at some point. I see no reason you couldn't do that.

866
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:56,929
So,

867
00:34:57,489 --> 00:34:59,030
so we'll say it is,

868
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:02,270
we're arguing over whether a mythical creature can,

869
00:35:02,479 --> 00:35:06,159
you know, fuel his deer with milk and cookies

870
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:06,600
like

871
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:06,800
the

872
00:35:07,959 --> 00:35:08,929
internet. There.

873
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:11,719
No life without internet is weird.

874
00:35:11,979 --> 00:35:16,389
So, so we'll say it is plausible that he has a hard connection.

875
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,169
Here's a question.

876
00:35:17,459 --> 00:35:20,610
Does he simply tap into the existing fiber optic cables in the area?

877
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,689
-- So he's
-- stealing internet. You're suggesting,

878
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,560
well, you know, it's, I mean, we've,

879
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:27,689
we've established that that type of activity is possible.

880
00:35:27,699 --> 00:35:29,570
You know, certain government agencies have

881
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,610
that, you know, have in the past

882
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:33,000
been known to do it.

883
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:33,330
I mean,

884
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,189
Santa obviously is technologically capable even if

885
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:38,310
it's disguised as like a reindeer.

886
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,489
But, I mean, let's face it. Right.

887
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:43,949
That's a long haul, you know, 12 engine bomber essentially

888
00:35:44,699 --> 00:35:47,280
with, you know, basically unlimited payload. Like,

889
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,540
uh, now, does he have unlimited payload or does he have a,

890
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:53,959
we'll bring out the dungeons and the dragons here, a bag of holding

891
00:35:54,189 --> 00:35:56,040
to hold all of his stuff.

892
00:35:56,179 --> 00:35:57,669
I would assume there has to be a bag

893
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:00,199
of holding or something involved because just the aerodynamics,

894
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:00,969
right? Like

895
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:03,419
the biggest airplane I'm aware of, like, what is it?

896
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:05,360
I think there's the, well commercially

897
00:36:06,419 --> 00:36:09,580
the guppy thing and that thing is huge but still like,

898
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,600
you know, it's not

899
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:13,010
that big. Like

900
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:14,580
when you think about like,

901
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:18,040
well to put it in terms of how many Amazon warehouses could you fit in there?

902
00:36:19,449 --> 00:36:19,949
You know, how many

903
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,229
Amazon warehouses?

904
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,149
So I would assume that there has to be some,

905
00:36:26,479 --> 00:36:28,010
you know, the more, the more we talk about it,

906
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,139
the more I think some sort of portal technology or b

907
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,899
of holding type stuff makes sense.

908
00:36:32,739 --> 00:36:33,899
Well, here's a question too,

909
00:36:33,909 --> 00:36:36,510
like he might have to haul a lot of coal and that stuff's heavy

910
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:38,040
and maybe that's

911
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:42,219
maybe that's why he's done Santa as a service to outsource it

912
00:36:42,229 --> 00:36:45,129
to the parents who don't punish their kids by giving them coal,

913
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:48,959
thus reducing global warming and ensuring the safety of the North Pole ice sheet.

914
00:36:49,649 --> 00:36:52,340
-- I think we figured it out.
-- What, say that again.

915
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:52,790
I

916
00:36:52,989 --> 00:36:53,010
know

917
00:36:54,209 --> 00:36:55,949
-- coal to
-- bad kids. Right.

918
00:36:55,969 --> 00:36:59,229
When you burn coal it creates CO2 and all that and global warming,

919
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:01,840
global warming reduces the ice sheet

920
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:06,030
which threatens Santa. So by outsourcing Santa as a service, it's a win, win.

921
00:37:06,739 --> 00:37:08,709
Right. He doesn't have to go over all the presents

922
00:37:09,209 --> 00:37:11,060
and there's less global warming gasses because

923
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,840
there's less coal being burned by Children

924
00:37:13,479 --> 00:37:16,689
do. Children was Children burning coal like AAA

925
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:17,320
problem.

926
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:17,530
I,

927
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:23,469
I don't know, give it, put it back in the coal pile downstairs in the basement and

928
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:23,939
burn it.

929
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,820
I guess I,

930
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:31,550
I'm not gonna say you're wrong because I, obviously I can't prove it,

931
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:32,229
but

932
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,729
we'll say it doesn't make sense.

933
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:35,709
Yeah.

934
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:40,149
Well, I, I think, you know, that we live in a post truth world, it could be correct.

935
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:42,110
That's true. It's, uh, uh what's,

936
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:43,760
what was, what was Colbert's

937
00:37:44,739 --> 00:37:46,030
turn me made up truth

938
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:46,830
or

939
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,370
truthiness.

940
00:37:47,909 --> 00:37:49,360
Truthiness. That's it. Right.

941
00:37:49,649 --> 00:37:51,540
There's a certain element of truthiness to it.

942
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,389
It's,

943
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:55,560
you know, so here's the other thing I love about all this right is

944
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:57,000
in hindsight

945
00:37:57,729 --> 00:37:59,300
when you think about

946
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:04,389
Santa is a service and everything that goes on here and how it all works. It's like,

947
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,479
it's so absurd

948
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:07,449
that

949
00:38:07,889 --> 00:38:12,080
I, I can't even begin to describe it is you look at this all and it like it,

950
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:15,739
none of this even remotely makes sense and Children like they eat it up, they love it.

951
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,770
Right. It's,

952
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,280
I guess the bigger the lie, the easier it is. Right.

953
00:38:20,149 --> 00:38:22,330
Well, what's interesting to me is just, you know,

954
00:38:22,729 --> 00:38:26,689
yeah, as a culture we just buy into this and, like, happily,

955
00:38:27,189 --> 00:38:31,169
well, it's fun to do it too. Right. Like, it's fun buying kids stuff. It's fun having,

956
00:38:31,479 --> 00:38:34,689
you know, all the silly games we play and all the things we do and,

957
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,169
and it, it is what it is, I guess. Right.

958
00:38:37,479 --> 00:38:40,010
Yeah. No, I mean, I'm certainly looking forward to it. Like, I mean,

959
00:38:40,189 --> 00:38:42,770
the, you know, especially with little kids, I think I, once they,

960
00:38:42,949 --> 00:38:46,189
from what I've seen, teenagers are not so fun around Christmas, dude,

961
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:48,139
teenagers aren't fun any time of year.

962
00:38:48,149 --> 00:38:50,590
Right. Christmas is no exception.

963
00:38:52,689 --> 00:38:55,719
This is one thing I've really noticed about parenting is parents seem to be

964
00:38:55,729 --> 00:38:59,229
a lot more candid now about how much they really dislike their Children.

965
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:00,010
I

966
00:39:00,139 --> 00:39:02,810
think some are, there's still a lot of snowflakes out there, man.

967
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,370
So, anyway,

968
00:39:04,939 --> 00:39:07,429
so we've established, Santa is plausible.

969
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,689
It's, it's totally not plausible.

970
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:15,850
However, I think Santa's uh surveillance network is not out of the question.

971
00:39:15,949 --> 00:39:21,449
The, the volume of or I guess the, the necessary amount of storage can and does exist.

972
00:39:21,479 --> 00:39:23,570
Getting an internet connection to the North Pole

973
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,929
would no doubt be a significant challenge but not

974
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,129
impossible.

975
00:39:28,139 --> 00:39:32,300
Especially if you already have a giant warehouse that is full of slave labor.

976
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:36,050
So why not just, you know, have a couple of them dig some holes in trenches.

977
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:38,250
So whatever we can deal with that, that's fine.

978
00:39:38,629 --> 00:39:42,780
So it's, now, here's the other thing I wonder though is, let's say you have a multi

979
00:39:42,979 --> 00:39:43,110
pab

980
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:47,629
byte database of various data on all of the people.

981
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:51,389
I wonder how long it would legitimately take to conduct searches over that data.

982
00:39:51,399 --> 00:39:53,969
Like if you wanted to find all the people named John who are naughty.

983
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,419
-- I think
-- it depends on how much ra M you're

984
00:39:56,429 --> 00:39:57,979
and servers you're willing to buy because you could,

985
00:39:57,989 --> 00:39:59,879
you could hold that in memory,

986
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,300
right? With given enough servers, right? Like a petabyte.

987
00:40:03,709 --> 00:40:06,739
Uh Well, let's say it's, you know, seven petabytes.

988
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:07,090
Well,

989
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,179
you divide by say 10 million servers and that's what

990
00:40:10,189 --> 00:40:12,889
700 or seven gigs of ra M per server.

991
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,969
Well, let's just say a million because that makes the numbers come out easy.

992
00:40:16,979 --> 00:40:17,709
So that would be

993
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,090
uh

994
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,540
you would need 7 million megabytes of ra M per server. So 7000 gigabytes.

995
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,629
-- So seven terabytes of ra M per
-- server. Not out

996
00:40:26,739 --> 00:40:27,459
of the question,

997
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:31,419
you can buy instances on Amazon with two terabytes of RA M right now today.

998
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:33,729
Sure, sure, sure.

999
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:38,820
And there's some amount of overhead with metadata and whatnot. But

1000
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,560
I wonder could you have

1001
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:45,050
in in this actually something folks out there listening. Are there multi pab

1002
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:48,280
byte databases today that are actually functional and usable?

1003
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:50,709
I understand you could do certain things with no SQL.

1004
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:52,949
But I would be interested in doing conducting

1005
00:40:52,959 --> 00:40:55,830
like some crazy sequel type searches where you're

1006
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,439
looking for various unrelated bits of information and

1007
00:40:58,449 --> 00:41:00,370
then tying them together because you gotta think

1008
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:03,969
even at a million servers getting those,

1009
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:04,120
I,

1010
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:06,110
I guess all pointed in the right direction and all

1011
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,600
conducting the correct operations is a very nontrivial problem.

1012
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:10,629
It's been done

1013
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:11,659
really

1014
00:41:11,919 --> 00:41:17,550
designing a multi petabyte database for LLSST which if memory serves as the large

1015
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,290
something something telescope,

1016
00:41:19,699 --> 00:41:20,689
right? It's a,

1017
00:41:20,939 --> 00:41:24,360
it's a 3.2 gigapixel camera essentially

1018
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,739
taking, oh, here we go.

1019
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:31,050
The 3.2 gigapixel LSLSST camera will produce approximately half a pet of die

1020
00:41:31,209 --> 00:41:31,479
by

1021
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,320
uh sorry, half a petabyte of archive images every month.

1022
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:37,250
So

1023
00:41:37,389 --> 00:41:38,959
six petabytes per year.

1024
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:40,520
So

1025
00:41:40,649 --> 00:41:44,820
uh I guess the bad news is this is not only possible, but it's been done

1026
00:41:45,189 --> 00:41:47,360
well. OK. OK. No, no, but here's the difference, right.

1027
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:51,719
Here's the difference is you're talking about enormous image files.

1028
00:41:51,729 --> 00:41:52,860
So practically speaking,

1029
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:55,760
they're probably talking what maybe a couple of 100

1030
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:58,439
or maybe a couple of 1000 image files per

1031
00:41:58,629 --> 00:41:59,239
day.

1032
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,020
Why would

1033
00:42:00,169 --> 00:42:01,909
somebody break it up? And um

1034
00:42:02,449 --> 00:42:03,969
you know, because you'd also like

1035
00:42:04,169 --> 00:42:04,760
-- uh
-- but,

1036
00:42:05,219 --> 00:42:06,189
but here's my point,

1037
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:09,510
here's the point is when we're talking about a database like Santa

1038
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,189
has and this is even true of all surveillance databases on the planet

1039
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:17,750
is you have lots of little pieces of data. It's not big pieces of data.

1040
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,040
I mean, unless he's has full motion video or something.

1041
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:23,080
And then obviously you also, his storage needs grow exponentially.

1042
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,129
But when we're talking about tons of little pieces of data things get crazy.

1043
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,360
One thing you can remember too is this database

1044
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:31,709
would be very easy to partition and shard.

1045
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:34,979
Oh, that's true. Because you could segment it by, by

1046
00:42:35,479 --> 00:42:37,870
continent or, or time zone.

1047
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,949
Yeah, that's true. That's true.

1048
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:40,179
You

1049
00:42:40,379 --> 00:42:40,550
know,

1050
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:43,939
and maybe I here's a crazy idea. Does he maybe do it in real time?

1051
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:48,389
Do what? In real time? Well, essentially if you know your delivery route, right?

1052
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,370
Because obviously he solved the traveling salesman problem.

1053
00:42:50,449 --> 00:42:52,639
Oh, he solved the traveling salesman problem.

1054
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:54,040
Sure, why not?

1055
00:42:54,389 --> 00:42:57,280
Yeah. So, so if he solved the traveling salesman problem, then,

1056
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:57,899
then we don't

1057
00:42:58,129 --> 00:42:58,370
have

1058
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:58,570
a

1059
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:02,399
-- series of sequential lookups.
-- He could be grossly inefficient for all we know.

1060
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,360
Right?

1061
00:43:03,399 --> 00:43:05,540
He doesn't necessarily mean he's delivering any

1062
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,189
of this stuff in an efficient manner

1063
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:11,449
and, or, or why bother solving it when you have Santa as a service, right?

1064
00:43:11,459 --> 00:43:12,979
You don't need to solve the traveling salesman

1065
00:43:12,989 --> 00:43:15,419
problem because everything's as a service salesman,

1066
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:17,050
as a service, that's the solution, right?

1067
00:43:17,479 --> 00:43:17,969
So,

1068
00:43:18,649 --> 00:43:20,979
so they did the LSST multi pab

1069
00:43:21,129 --> 00:43:23,629
byte database on my SQL

1070
00:43:26,139 --> 00:43:29,810
and they also evaluated MS SQL server and IBM DB two.

1071
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,459
And basically,

1072
00:43:31,469 --> 00:43:35,800
uh but it looks like my SQL worked for them because it has a partitioning engine.

1073
00:43:37,639 --> 00:43:39,189
Like that's the thing to remember, right?

1074
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:43,100
Is, is problems that used to be like ridiculous scale problems.

1075
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:44,239
Like I remember when,

1076
00:43:44,689 --> 00:43:46,639
well, here's a great example, folks go

1077
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,379
run emacs and open a file larger than 10 megabytes.

1078
00:43:49,389 --> 00:43:52,800
And emacs gives you a warning that it's opening a very large file.

1079
00:43:53,449 --> 00:43:53,989
Right?

1080
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,360
And I'm like, I don't think I have any, you know, like

1081
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:57,600
I like,

1082
00:43:57,610 --> 00:44:01,949
and I remember when opening a one or two megabyte file was a big deal and actually

1083
00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:03,669
getting it to load without crashing and editing

1084
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:05,320
it and saving it without crashing was like,

1085
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:05,879
wow,

1086
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:07,310
I have accomplished something.

1087
00:44:07,439 --> 00:44:10,209
-- I
-- can't even beat that. I remember when I was a cis

1088
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,600
edin on some sun gear.

1089
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:15,959
Way back in the day, we just, we uninstalled emacs because it used too much memory

1090
00:44:16,235 --> 00:44:16,804
when you

1091
00:44:17,044 --> 00:44:17,725
opened it.

1092
00:44:17,844 --> 00:44:18,175
So

1093
00:44:18,475 --> 00:44:20,145
everyone had to use V I

1094
00:44:20,334 --> 00:44:23,504
Yeah, I mean, the, the joke was eight megs and constantly swapping.

1095
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:24,485
Right. Right.

1096
00:44:24,594 --> 00:44:26,185
You know, and now I,

1097
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:29,044
yeah, I mean, so that's the thing to remember is a lot of these,

1098
00:44:29,074 --> 00:44:32,175
that's something I'm having to, you know, constantly remind myself is,

1099
00:44:32,395 --> 00:44:35,185
you know, these problems of scale we used to have, have

1100
00:44:36,129 --> 00:44:39,090
in many cases been solved and in many cases been solved

1101
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,060
and just put into open source software and boom done.

1102
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:41,409
Like,

1103
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:45,500
you know, some of these message queuing uh software packages that can handle,

1104
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:45,919
you know,

1105
00:44:45,929 --> 00:44:48,449
hundreds of thousands of messages a second with

1106
00:44:48,459 --> 00:44:50,760
like barely any tuning on a single server,

1107
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:51,439
you know,

1108
00:44:51,449 --> 00:44:55,219
these databases like my SQL and post press SQL which can handle like abs

1109
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:58,709
like literally absurd amounts of data would I think be the technical term,

1110
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:01,679
you know, certain amounts of data

1111
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:02,110
uh

1112
00:45:02,889 --> 00:45:08,879
you can buy, you know, one terabyte PC IE cards, you know, 16 channel cards with,

1113
00:45:08,889 --> 00:45:10,610
you know, that'll handle, I think, what was it like?

1114
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:13,770
I was looking at one and it was half a million I OS per second, you know,

1115
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:16,070
at four kilobytes each or something like,

1116
00:45:16,489 --> 00:45:19,959
again, for something like a database of this type, you know, being able to

1117
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:22,639
pull 500,000 records a second.

1118
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,709
And that's just a single card.

1119
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:27,129
Obviously, you would have like many, many, many of these.

1120
00:45:27,889 --> 00:45:29,229
So it's definitely doable.

1121
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,530
I think it's safe to say that that the

1122
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:35,739
Santa Surveillance database is quite plausible in reality,

1123
00:45:35,879 --> 00:45:37,600
which is kind of crazy because actually when I

1124
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,270
started writing this stuff down and thinking about it,

1125
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:39,979
I'm like, oh ha ha.

1126
00:45:39,989 --> 00:45:41,310
This is funny. This can't happen

1127
00:45:41,649 --> 00:45:43,669
and really it, it, it kind of is,

1128
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:44,179
you know,

1129
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,179
I kind of want to do like just a little back of

1130
00:45:47,189 --> 00:45:50,620
the envelope spreadsheet looking at and this is like commercial pricing.

1131
00:45:50,629 --> 00:45:53,949
I'm sure Santa gets a discount because if not you get on the naughty list.

1132
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:54,520
That's

1133
00:45:54,629 --> 00:45:55,129
true. That's

1134
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:55,439
true.

1135
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:59,510
That's right. He's got like mob style power here, right?

1136
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,820
-- It be like, be a shame if something happened to that there,
-- those presents,

1137
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:04,790
if they didn't uh,

1138
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:08,965
-- or worse, it'd be a shame if something happened to your kids presence.
-- That's true.

1139
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:09,625
Right. Right.

1140
00:46:10,304 --> 00:46:13,354
I mean, it's one thing to punish somebody but to get their kids to punish them,

1141
00:46:13,364 --> 00:46:14,754
that's a whole other level of pain.

1142
00:46:14,844 --> 00:46:15,034
It's

1143
00:46:15,155 --> 00:46:16,024
well known

1144
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:16,905
evil. Right.

1145
00:46:16,915 --> 00:46:20,064
You go after the family, that's how you get to the person you're trying to reach.

1146
00:46:20,754 --> 00:46:23,145
But I'm thinking this actually wouldn't be as

1147
00:46:23,445 --> 00:46:26,614
difficult or expensive as we think because the biggest thing like, you know,

1148
00:46:26,625 --> 00:46:29,225
like it, you can just partition this database up,

1149
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,584
you know, and that right there, you know,

1150
00:46:32,155 --> 00:46:33,534
solves a lot of problems.

1151
00:46:34,169 --> 00:46:34,870
Interesting.

1152
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:38,649
Is there an Amazon data center at the North Pole?

1153
00:46:39,449 --> 00:46:44,149
Uh They just opened one up in Montreal like literally yesterday,

1154
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:47,550
like a few days ago or it was at the beginning of December.

1155
00:46:47,919 --> 00:46:48,709
Um

1156
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:52,169
So again, they're, they're gradually moving north,

1157
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,709
you know, coincidence. I don't think so.

1158
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,860
That's right. That's right. And cooling, right? Cheap cooling.

1159
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:04,439
-- Let's
-- go for that most of the year. Yeah. Yeah. Just crank open the windows.

1160
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,030
-- Yep.
-- Yep. Yeah.

1161
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:07,429
Oh man.

1162
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:09,060
All right. This has been

1163
00:47:09,229 --> 00:47:11,820
an awesome episode to say the least.

1164
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:12,800
So

1165
00:47:13,409 --> 00:47:17,360
for the show notes and there will be many this time as we,

1166
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:19,219
we talked about all kinds of crazy stuff.

1167
00:47:19,229 --> 00:47:21,250
It's open source security podcast.com

1168
00:47:21,919 --> 00:47:22,459
and

1169
00:47:23,149 --> 00:47:25,760
go there. We'll, we'll have links to all this fun stuff. It's,

1170
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,179
I love this topic. It's been crazy to think about.

1171
00:47:29,189 --> 00:47:32,500
I've had a blast writing all these notes down throughout the week as,

1172
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:33,469
as we discussed it.

1173
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:34,340
And

1174
00:47:34,709 --> 00:47:38,060
if I don't know how many more of these will have before Christmas.

1175
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:44,179
But I, if we don't catch anyone else before, then everyone have a fantastic holiday.

1176
00:47:44,189 --> 00:47:45,860
Whatever it is you may do

1177
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:47,060
and

1178
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:47,489
not do

1179
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:50,280
or not do. That's true. We don't judge

1180
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:51,810
and if nothing else

1181
00:47:52,179 --> 00:47:53,239
until next time,

1182
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:54,229
take care.

1183
00:47:55,209 --> 00:47:56,120
Thanks, everybody.
