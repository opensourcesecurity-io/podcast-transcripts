Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt

1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,390
Siefried

2
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:12,289
and my physically isolated. I hope partner

3
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:13,090
Josh Brass.

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,170
That's right. So I, I have COVID.

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,540
It's, I'm doing quite well, but I'm testing positive. I have

6
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:24,129
extremely mild symptoms and I told Kurt, let's, let's cut a podcast now before,

7
00:00:24,139 --> 00:00:25,090
in case I get worse.

8
00:00:25,229 --> 00:00:29,479
Oh, please don't do the audio editing. If you're like all COVID fog brained up,

9
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:33,430
no one will edit this podcast except me because they will do it wrong.

10
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:35,569
No, what I'm saying is you shouldn't do it until you're better.

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,659
Oh, well, I've already got one in the, in the Hopper. So we're fine.

12
00:00:38,669 --> 00:00:40,349
I got like two weeks for this. Good.

13
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,740
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's great

14
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:42,099
because

15
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,080
that's honestly my biggest fear of getting COVID

16
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,540
is because I'm fully vaxxed and everything.

17
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:47,299
It's just that long COVID stupidity

18
00:00:47,409 --> 00:00:49,080
that like people talk about and

19
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,119
Charles Strauss, you know, author

20
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,119
and he's like, you know, it took me like three days to write a page of text.

21
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:54,479
So

22
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:55,180
the

23
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,599
thing I keep thinking of is I feel like I'm quite lucid and with it,

24
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:04,760
but am I, is my brain is my brain telling me this is just how I am.

25
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:06,470
Well, this is the same problem with drunk people.

26
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:07,410
Right.

27
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,955
-- Yeah.
-- How do you feel? I feel fine.

28
00:01:09,964 --> 00:01:12,055
I'm fine. I could, I could drive,

29
00:01:12,324 --> 00:01:14,815
you can't, you can't find your pocket to get your keys out.

30
00:01:14,985 --> 00:01:18,544
He's gonna drive your car. Yep. Yep. I know. I know. So, we'll see. Anyway.

31
00:01:18,555 --> 00:01:20,675
Anyway, I'm actually really excited for today.

32
00:01:20,684 --> 00:01:23,334
There's a tweet from Kelsey Hightower that I want to read

33
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:26,775
and I'm just gonna read it verbatim. I'll put a link in the show notes of course, but

34
00:01:27,105 --> 00:01:27,925
it, it says

35
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,800
less people are using OS package managers in some language.

36
00:01:31,809 --> 00:01:35,989
Ecosystems have moved towards source based dependency management.

37
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:38,089
How do we deal with vulnerabilities when a

38
00:01:38,269 --> 00:01:39,669
get update isn't an option?

39
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,199
The Go security team offers a solution for Go

40
00:01:42,339 --> 00:01:45,239
Lang and then it links to a blog from, from the Golan

41
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,489
folks. And basically

42
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,500
what's happening

43
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,290
is go

44
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:51,339
will now tell you if the dependencies

45
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:53,379
you're using have security vulnerabilities in them,

46
00:01:53,389 --> 00:01:54,019
-- which
-- is cool.

47
00:01:54,169 --> 00:01:58,059
I mean, we've been doing this at the CS A for years

48
00:01:58,309 --> 00:02:00,529
with N PM N PM has had this for a long time. Yeah,

49
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:04,699
exactly. Like we, we were there are Ruby on rails shop with N PM and whatnot. It's like

50
00:02:05,029 --> 00:02:05,819
what is it bundler

51
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,550
audit or yarn audit or something? And like

52
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,580
they use ecosystem

53
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,990
specific tools that have an ecosystem specific database.

54
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,550
My devs have Macs but I think vagrant set up. So it's a Linux

55
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,350
thing

56
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,270
running on top of

57
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:18,229
Hoku, which is Linux.

58
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:20,949
Well, it doesn't matter. And that's exactly. And that's the point

59
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:24,770
if you use the system package manager, for example,

60
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,300
we're going to pick on Red Hat because you and

61
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:27,800
I used to work there and we know that's right.

62
00:02:27,809 --> 00:02:29,509
We know all about this.

63
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,190
We know a thing or two and this is generally

64
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:33,380
true for all Linux distributions and P sds as well,

65
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:35,179
even though ports is totally different than packages.

66
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,070
But it's basically the same thing. But the point is

67
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:41,100
ok. So Red Hat wants to get all of the pie pie packages into R PM.

68
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,000
You can't, there's just too many damn pi pie packages. Even if you automated it,

69
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,160
half of them would still be broken in some weird way.

70
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:52,750
-- Well, pipe pie is nothing. Pi pie is what? 30,000, maybe
-- 350,000,

71
00:02:53,059 --> 00:02:54,160
350,000.

72
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,190
Yeah, it's about a third of a million. So like,

73
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:04,740
-- yeah, like
-- which now a typical Linux distribution has a couple of 1000 packages.

74
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,470
Generally

75
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:09,160
-- uh
-- Red hats running around 10 to 15,000 in total across all their ecosystems.

76
00:03:09,514 --> 00:03:11,304
But Red Hat's the outlier.

77
00:03:11,434 --> 00:03:14,014
There's Red Hat and souza, there's Debian Ubuntu

78
00:03:14,425 --> 00:03:17,354
and again, about 10 to 15, maybe 20,000 packages in total.

79
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:18,875
But if you start looking at packages,

80
00:03:19,095 --> 00:03:20,414
a lot of them are out of date and dead.

81
00:03:20,425 --> 00:03:21,225
Like, and I should know,

82
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:25,145
because I'm in charge of two of them for Fedora that I abandoned like a decade ago.

83
00:03:25,649 --> 00:03:28,759
Ok. I just looked up Debian has 59,000 packages

84
00:03:28,899 --> 00:03:31,000
but how many of them have been updated in the last two years?

85
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:34,479
Oh, man. I bet, I bet the number is, is bananas for sure.

86
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,039
It's about 20%. It's

87
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,880
most distro seem to average. Yeah, it's, it's a magic number.

88
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:43,669
-- It's like 10 grand to 15,000.
-- I assume it's long tail, right? Where the

89
00:03:43,779 --> 00:03:49,320
the core things like kernel X Windows, web browser, all that stuff gets a lot of

90
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,330
updates and then you've got crap way on the end,

91
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,080
there's about 1 to 2000 core packages for each

92
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:57,410
Os that are like if you look at the security updates page, they're all there.

93
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,250
So that's the first thing is,

94
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:04,990
is quite literally even if Red Hat or Debian or Ubuntu wanted to

95
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,490
put every single pie pie package and N PM package and everything into

96
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,009
their package ecosystem.

97
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,130
They can't like it's just

98
00:04:12,529 --> 00:04:13,289
there's too many.

99
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,639
Secondly,

100
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,630
what would be the benefit those ecosystems have good package managers?

101
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,730
-- There
-- would be a negative benefit actually because one

102
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:23,179
of the selling points of the current Linux distributions,

103
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,190
they they say like we this is a curated garden, right?

104
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,959
Come to us and you know, the things we give you will be cared for you.

105
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,769
Now, that's a debatable point, obviously, but generally speaking,

106
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,630
the core packages in

107
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,579
an operating system are well cared for.

108
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:41,989
Well, I mean, that's in general the whole point of open source based distributions.

109
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,869
Be it an operating system, be it something like,

110
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,579
you know what the Apache software foundation does with Java stuff or whatever.

111
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:48,579
It's like, yes,

112
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:51,260
you could absolutely go on the internet and download a bunch of

113
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:54,089
source code and make it work yourself and glue it together.

114
00:04:54,579 --> 00:04:57,230
Or you could just grab Debbie and man, like we have a nice bootloader.

115
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:58,339
We have a package manager,

116
00:04:58,910 --> 00:04:59,220
you know,

117
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,100
everything works

118
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:03,660
-- well
-- and, and so I think that's part of this story, right?

119
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,079
Is if we look historically, I remember in the early days of Red Hat,

120
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:09,720
there was a very concerted effort to say like

121
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,940
you should only be using the things we're shipping,

122
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:12,549
right?

123
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:15,959
Don't use this other stuff like installing random binaries off the internet,

124
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,929
installing random Python packages,

125
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:18,790
man.

126
00:05:18,859 --> 00:05:22,089
Yeah, don't do that stuff because we're taking care of what we have and,

127
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,119
and back in the day.

128
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:26,459
Well, we did as well because it was a very small number of packages.

129
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,200
So we, we literally, it was, it was, you know, heavy lifting,

130
00:05:29,549 --> 00:05:30,230
but we did it

131
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,489
well and more to the point you've got

132
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,059
commercial vendors and other vendors who just drop their

133
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:37,260
stuff into opt and kind of hope it works because what else are they gonna do?

134
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,000
That's, that's a kind of a different story.

135
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:39,649
Well,

136
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,489
but it's the same thing as these packagers taking

137
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,570
it instead of if I'm a pipe pie maintainer,

138
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,890
do I want to go build packages for Red Hat Debbie and Ubuntu

139
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,204
alpine blah, blah or do I just want to build my pipe pye package? And

140
00:05:50,535 --> 00:05:51,065
it's funny,

141
00:05:51,075 --> 00:05:54,165
I actually just got a um an automated thing asking me about

142
00:05:54,174 --> 00:05:57,325
my interactions with pipe and their management like pip and install,

143
00:05:57,334 --> 00:05:59,605
easy install and all those like, do you contribute?

144
00:05:59,614 --> 00:06:02,045
Why don't you contribute? What stops you from contributing?

145
00:06:02,225 --> 00:06:05,834
And honestly, I was just like, because this stuff works, like,

146
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,859
why would I get default if it just works

147
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,049
because I'll just make it worse. Let's be clear.

148
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,839
And, and then I just, I actually ended up giving up on the survey about six pages and

149
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,809
it was too long

150
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,440
as a developer. It's like,

151
00:06:18,869 --> 00:06:19,380
well,

152
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,670
you could make all these

153
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:23,049
packages or push people to make all these packages

154
00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:25,200
for all because there's over 100 Linux distro.

155
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:26,700
And again, what would the benefit be?

156
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,739
You're from like a from just a simple economics perspective,

157
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:33,820
-- you build pip and boom, everything in pipe P works right
-- now.

158
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:36,640
Let's ignore that, that particular issue because I think it's,

159
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:39,829
it's talking about building every Python or node

160
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:42,390
package for an operating system is bananas.

161
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,040
What, what Kelsey Hightower said,

162
00:06:44,049 --> 00:06:47,380
I think is kind of more interesting when you look at how the world has changed

163
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,609
because back in the early days, you took your install CD

164
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:55,829
and you installed an operating system and then you installed software,

165
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:58,209
you need to be at web browsers or whatever, right?

166
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:02,790
And now we exist in this world where, you know, to kind of just steal the term DEV

167
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:03,359
ops

168
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:08,190
where the developers are often building the thing that gets deployed, right?

169
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,609
As a container image. And from their perspective,

170
00:07:10,739 --> 00:07:11,920
they don't give two craps.

171
00:07:11,929 --> 00:07:13,559
If they're using operating system packages,

172
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,970
-- they want to make something
-- work like snap

173
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,880
or, or just,

174
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:22,000
I mean, that's, that's the thing I love about Mac Os. Where's my, where's my thing?

175
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,040
Oh, it's just this file,

176
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:24,239
right?

177
00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:25,200
And

178
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:25,959
well, but

179
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,850
oh, I want to remove this program,

180
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:31,350
-- drag and drop it to the trash bin and it's gone until
-- you install home.

181
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:31,880
Brew.

182
00:07:31,929 --> 00:07:35,440
-- Well, yeah, I know about home brew. I use that
-- Homebrew craps all over your desk.

183
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:39,440
There's something to be said for also just having stuff kind of work

184
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:41,540
and maybe it's not like the, and I'm making her

185
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,720
here like the old correct way because a perfect example of this, right.

186
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,399
Red hat was a big believer in the packages because for example,

187
00:07:47,929 --> 00:07:52,140
everything should use the system G zip, not its internal G zip because that way when,

188
00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:53,720
when not, if, but when there's

189
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,980
G zip, we just update one system package and you like,

190
00:07:56,989 --> 00:07:59,140
restart your server and you're done, you're good.

191
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:03,589
You don't have to go play archaeological Splunk looking for G zip and all your stuff

192
00:08:03,739 --> 00:08:03,880
or

193
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,209
log for J because for example,

194
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,929
almost every open source package that does compression includes

195
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,000
gzip. So it'll compile on Windows.

196
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:12,220
It's just

197
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,480
exactly. And same thing with XML, right? Same thing with XML.

198
00:08:15,489 --> 00:08:19,040
They like, I remember when XML hash for do SS came out and I'm like, oh my God,

199
00:08:19,049 --> 00:08:21,540
why does everything have its own XML cut and paste in here?

200
00:08:21,549 --> 00:08:24,170
Oh, because Windows OK. Fine. Yeah, we don't use that cool, great.

201
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,839
But the world has also changed in the

202
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:29,170
sense of Linux distributions are way more stable.

203
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:30,790
Like the rate of change in Linux

204
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:32,808
-- has slowed down significantly. Like,
-- oh man,

205
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:35,080
-- it's so boring now, which
-- is great.

206
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:38,408
You know, it's like cars, cars are really boring right now.

207
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:41,619
Like they just work mostly not compared to 50 years ago.

208
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:45,939
People have these platforms that are stable enough and similar enough like the uh

209
00:08:45,948 --> 00:08:50,598
the LSB you and I lived in a world pre Lsbihlsb so much I

210
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:50,729
do.

211
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:53,479
But the point is like politics, even though it's terrible,

212
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:55,219
it's more terrible without it.

213
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,460
And so the Linux standard base is this idea of

214
00:08:57,469 --> 00:08:59,530
like we will at a minimum have something that's like

215
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,640
-- Glib C
-- like, let me explain this in a way.

216
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:02,190
That isn't,

217
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,450
that is an old man because that explanation is old

218
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,169
man and probably no one knows what LSB is,

219
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,880
which is great because don't, don't even look it up.

220
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:08,299
It

221
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:09,909
don't, don't look it up. I'm not putting in the show

222
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:13,169
notes. So if I have a container that has Debian

223
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,809
and I'm installing

224
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,380
pip inside of it and then I do my pip, install whatever.

225
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:22,250
And I've got my Python application and I package it up and then I hand it over to the ops

226
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,770
and say, here's a container, run it.

227
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:27,669
If I switch out Debian for alpine, there is an extremely high probability,

228
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:30,250
no one would even notice anything changed,

229
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:32,299
-- right? Which is
-- cool

230
00:09:32,429 --> 00:09:34,929
and, and an alpine doesn't even have g lipsy. It uses mule,

231
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:35,640
like,

232
00:09:36,349 --> 00:09:38,380
but it's compatible and that's the thing, right?

233
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:42,700
I remember downloading stuff like bind and having to hand

234
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:47,500
patch and tweak it to make it work on my flavor of Linux because the ISC people clearly

235
00:09:47,869 --> 00:09:48,919
they made it work on like slurs

236
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,179
and stuff, but not on my flavor of Linux.

237
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,739
And now I can't even imagine downloading something and having to do that.

238
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,619
Like if I did it was, it would be clearly broken.

239
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:02,099
I can't remember the last time I compiled source code into a binary that wasn't go

240
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:07,719
-- on my system.
-- Well, even more. When's the last time you compiled source into binary?

241
00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:08,780
That wasn't like a

242
00:10:08,969 --> 00:10:10,070
like not the classic

243
00:10:10,284 --> 00:10:10,364
do

244
00:10:10,645 --> 00:10:12,104
slash make, make, install whatever,

245
00:10:12,114 --> 00:10:15,054
but like like R PM build like R PM build already is

246
00:10:15,585 --> 00:10:17,354
-- stuff away.
-- Wait, I, I just remembered

247
00:10:17,565 --> 00:10:22,135
I wrote C code and compile it while I was at cipher con in maybe May

248
00:10:22,244 --> 00:10:25,594
because in their program, they had some C code and had a buffer overflow in it.

249
00:10:25,604 --> 00:10:27,895
So I typed it in to make sure I was right. And then I mocked them.

250
00:10:27,905 --> 00:10:30,544
-- Couldn't
-- they just give you a QR code where you could download the file?

251
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:32,515
They made you type it in, like in 19 eighties

252
00:10:32,945 --> 00:10:36,674
it wasn't a file meant to be typed in. It was, it was like a background image

253
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:37,830
and they were,

254
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:42,250
they didn't their buffer, their string buffer wasn't null terminated,

255
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,070
right?

256
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,640
Anyway,

257
00:10:45,869 --> 00:10:47,539
and that's the thing, the world changed like stuff.

258
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:49,320
Here's the thing 20 some years ago.

259
00:10:49,489 --> 00:10:52,500
Like remember when Pearl CP Pan came out the Comprehensive Pearl Archive Network,

260
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,760
which was essentially the

261
00:10:53,979 --> 00:10:57,000
like I think it was kind of the first one to really do this and succeed at it.

262
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,309
It's the first I knew of

263
00:10:58,489 --> 00:10:58,960
and it,

264
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,049
it totally worked and succeeded at this.

265
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:03,679
Like all that's one of the reasons Pearl took off is because,

266
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,679
oh you have Solaris, I have Linux. Well,

267
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,049
yeah, you just

268
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:07,460
C

269
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,940
A this stuff in and, but a boop

270
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:13,119
and that's the thing is that it gives you this beautiful layer of abstraction

271
00:11:13,219 --> 00:11:16,159
where if your pip or your CPA or your whatever tool works,

272
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:18,000
then everything else will work,

273
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,440
right?

274
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,929
You basically have to port the interpreter to

275
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,760
the platform which you have to do anyways

276
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,750
and you have to port the install

277
00:11:24,859 --> 00:11:26,400
thing of a jigger to the platform,

278
00:11:26,849 --> 00:11:30,469
which you're probably gonna want to do anyways versus having it

279
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:35,559
done at that operating system level, way of doing it. And there's hundreds of these.

280
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,909
Ok. Now, I want to take the conversation up to the next level

281
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,909
and that is, if I'm running a Linux distribution,

282
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:45,000
I can subscribe to their vulnerability feed and I get

283
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:48,109
a note whenever they release a terrible security update.

284
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:48,409
Right in the,

285
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,669
in theory. But if, historically, if I was using some

286
00:11:52,775 --> 00:11:54,635
like Python or node or go,

287
00:11:55,145 --> 00:11:58,974
it was kind of yellowing it where I didn't really know what was in there.

288
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,755
I mean, in many instances, if you had to go binary

289
00:12:01,974 --> 00:12:06,914
before it was 1.16 maybe they like you couldn't even tell what, like what was in it.

290
00:12:06,924 --> 00:12:10,614
And now they add information about the dependencies directly into the binary,

291
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:11,354
which is great.

292
00:12:11,604 --> 00:12:15,125
Well, on a practical level, Javis had this problem forever because part of it is Java

293
00:12:15,405 --> 00:12:16,515
is so huge,

294
00:12:16,645 --> 00:12:18,625
you have like 16 million packages

295
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,619
and one of them is like Http dot Jar and the other one is also Http dot Jar, but they,

296
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,460
you know, one is

297
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,270
six kilobytes and the other one is six megabytes.

298
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:27,690
So

299
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:28,669
like,

300
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,979
where did they come from?

301
00:12:29,989 --> 00:12:34,460
-- And it's like, literally
-- Maven has fixed a lot of this because now Maven includes,

302
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,900
well, Maven exists now, didn't when we were around.

303
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,010
I mean, you're right, you're right. I remember,

304
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,340
I remember pulling apart an R PM

305
00:12:41,979 --> 00:12:43,390
and you know, what the Build Toast was.

306
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,080
Workstation dash something.

307
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:47,520
Not a domain name but like just a single.

308
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:52,270
I, I know, you know, and I'm like, where did this come from? And we can't ship it?

309
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,109
Oh, no, I, I know, I remember that.

310
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:57,440
I remember when a nontrivial amount of the fedora infrastructure

311
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,950
was like running under someone's desk and it's like,

312
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,710
this is probably bad

313
00:13:01,909 --> 00:13:05,640
-- an R PM that had an iso image in it. And I'm like, uh what
-- now?

314
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,400
That's probably fine. That was probably, was it KVM?

315
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,359
-- Uh It was a satellite thing, I think.
-- Satellite. Ok. Same thing. That's fine.

316
00:13:13,369 --> 00:13:16,559
That's fine. The point is I'm kind of like, what is this file? And why is it so big

317
00:13:16,794 --> 00:13:18,364
followed by, oh, there's an entire

318
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:21,114
whole other operating system in here. I hope it's ours.

319
00:13:21,354 --> 00:13:22,364
No, that was my first thought.

320
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,375
It's like I really do hope it's ours because I don't know, I'm sure it's signed.

321
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,044
I mounted

322
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:26,844
it was,

323
00:13:26,945 --> 00:13:27,025
it was.

324
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:28,234
But um,

325
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:32,534
but that's the thing, right? Like it's, it's a, it's a scale and efficiency thing of

326
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,719
you port the interpreter to the platform.

327
00:13:34,909 --> 00:13:37,599
That's the sunk cost you port the, the installer.

328
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,559
And then,

329
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,679
and here's the clever bit,

330
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,570
like I told my CS A devs don't bother tracking security bones.

331
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,700
Just keep that thing up to date. You update it twice a week and ship it out twice a week.

332
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:49,119
Sure that I can't ask for much more than that. Now you always say this.

333
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,659
Now, granted that works for like we have a website that we control everything.

334
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:53,570
We're not shipping a piece of

335
00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:56,390
for that has to run on 16 Kaji different platforms.

336
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,830
-- We
-- have like Anchor Enterprise is a

337
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:04,179
nontrivial piece of software that has to connect to various databases

338
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:08,969
and various scanners and various endpoints. And so when we upgrade

339
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:13,090
most of those libraries, it is a significant amount of testing that happens.

340
00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:14,570
That's the beauty, right is there's,

341
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,119
there's a huge amount of risk that we

342
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:20,250
can't even begin to quantify because nobody keeps records

343
00:14:20,739 --> 00:14:23,559
and it really boils down to like nine times out of 10.

344
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,010
It works 100% of the time where you just update everything

345
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:29,200
and like literally nothing breaks and then once in a while

346
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,239
you like tweak some minor version

347
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,239
and like kaboom, it just breaks.

348
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:34,150
Yeah.

349
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,859
Yeah. Or it happens all the time.

350
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:39,549
Or my favorite is when like something, you know, you get a 1.2 0.17 and the devs like,

351
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:40,179
yep, that's fine.

352
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,260
But we're, we're, we're going to 2.0 now and you're just like, oh,

353
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,190
you know, there's my weekend gone.

354
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:46,580
Its

355
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,159
this speaks again to mature software practices of having like end to end testing.

356
00:14:51,169 --> 00:14:52,309
Like not just smoke test.

357
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,299
Like, like if I hit password reset,

358
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:56,330
do I actually does an email pop out at the other end?

359
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:56,900
You know, if I

360
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:57,609
like

361
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,419
we connected to the database, the connection was established. Cool.

362
00:15:00,429 --> 00:15:02,530
But like when you actually send the query, does it

363
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:03,409
the

364
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:03,830
correct

365
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,890
thing back.

366
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:08,570
And that's hard. That is a ton of work. It is good. Tests are very hard.

367
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,719
But the thing is if you build all that testing

368
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:13,859
yet now you can really start to YOLO it because

369
00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:16,020
if it does break, you'll find out right away.

370
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,739
Sure. Oh, absolutely. And, and I mean, that's literally what we do.

371
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:23,640
We have an enormous amount of testing and we obviously, you know, what's,

372
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:28,280
what's wild now is there are test suites that track the amount of coverage you have.

373
00:15:28,289 --> 00:15:34,080
So we can be like, we're only hitting 80% of the code. How do we get to 85 90 95?

374
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,780
And that's really cool. You know, that kind of stuff just didn't exist.

375
00:15:36,789 --> 00:15:40,229
Well, you know, I'm always reminded of, remember when Google built the whole letter

376
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,929
test PDF

377
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:46,000
and they're like, you know, what we really need is like a corpus of PDF,

378
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:48,469
all the PDF S and they're like, oh yeah, we have that.

379
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,380
We're Google.

380
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,789
And so what was it like? 10 terabytes of PDF S or something crazy?

381
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:53,469
And it's like, yeah,

382
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:56,200
it's every code path gets exercised through this corpus

383
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:59,510
that they boil down into this monstrous data set.

384
00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:00,309
But it's like,

385
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:01,070
and

386
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,500
what's really cool is,

387
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:05,229
so there's a project Google does called OS S Fuzz

388
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:07,830
and there is uh a measuring aspect to it.

389
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,140
I forget the name of it off the top of my head.

390
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,609
I'll try to look it up later and put in the show notes maybe. But

391
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:17,440
basically Os S fuzz now is designed in a way that it watches the binary as it runs.

392
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,200
And it can say, all right, we've taken this code path 66 times.

393
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,530
How do we get onto this code path over here?

394
00:16:22,539 --> 00:16:25,530
Oh, we just twiddle this bit and now we can explore down there.

395
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,909
And that's really cool. And so anyway, anyway,

396
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:29,169
so we are going to get this to

397
00:16:29,315 --> 00:16:29,924
happy at

398
00:16:30,044 --> 00:16:32,604
scale because having a human being twiddle your

399
00:16:32,614 --> 00:16:34,815
test cases to exercise every code path.

400
00:16:34,965 --> 00:16:36,674
You're going to need 1000 people.

401
00:16:36,945 --> 00:16:39,094
Well, that's it. Like you're gonna need 1000 people,

402
00:16:39,224 --> 00:16:40,215
which is not happening

403
00:16:40,684 --> 00:16:40,705
so

404
00:16:40,885 --> 00:16:40,914
bad.

405
00:16:41,505 --> 00:16:43,455
So anyway, here is, I think

406
00:16:43,674 --> 00:16:46,724
the, the, the, the moral of the whole story, right?

407
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,469
The operating system used to be special.

408
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,059
And now, well,

409
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,400
actually the hardware used to be special and now it's a commodity

410
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,799
and the operating system was special and now it's a commodity,

411
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:56,280
the development environment used to be

412
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:58,140
special and they're turning into commodities

413
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,159
like let's face it.

414
00:16:59,169 --> 00:16:59,359
I mean,

415
00:16:59,369 --> 00:17:01,469
-- we're reaching a point
-- where text editors that

416
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:04,209
do syntax highlighting used to be magic.

417
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:06,000
And now I think they all do it. I mean,

418
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,189
oh, you know, I just noticed in VS code, I love this,

419
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,660
I was writing some Python code and it underlined re like I

420
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,229
had an re match and it underlined it with a red squiggle.

421
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:14,439
And I'm like, that's not spelt wrong.

422
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:16,469
And then I realized I didn't have an import re statement.

423
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:17,319
So

424
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,079
I added that corrected it. I'm like, oh, that's nice.

425
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,260
Did you click it? Because you can also click on the little light bulb and it will often

426
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:28,239
give you like, say, oh, I can fix this for you. And I bet that one could be fixed

427
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,449
because like

428
00:17:29,729 --> 00:17:33,489
anytime you call an object in Python, it has to exist somewhere.

429
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:37,439
And so if you use like a new variable name, like if you assign it, it's happy.

430
00:17:37,449 --> 00:17:40,310
But if you use it without assigning it, it's like uh I don't like that.

431
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:43,880
And I'm like, thank you because whoops. But um and that thing is that stuff used to

432
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,750
not be the default, but now it is.

433
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:50,630
And that's the thing like developers basically only care about their one

434
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,150
or two language runtime because what else would they care about?

435
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:53,760
Right.

436
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:54,839
That's their job.

437
00:17:54,849 --> 00:17:58,819
Their job is to crank out Ruby on rails code or N PM coder or a website.

438
00:17:59,089 --> 00:18:02,750
Well, and that's the dream, right? I mean, I remember my first job out of college,

439
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,810
I was in a server room with other admins. I was the UNIX admin.

440
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,780
We had like five Windows admins because Windows admins could

441
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,459
only take care of like two computers back then.

442
00:18:11,469 --> 00:18:12,069
And like

443
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,260
that's all we did,

444
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,260
there were developers developing and we just gave the care and

445
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,609
feeding to the hardware and the software and think like,

446
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:20,780
does anyone do that anymore?

447
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,540
I mean, it's, it's become a commodity,

448
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:25,099
old school still does and it's incredibly inefficient.

449
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:26,930
And that's one of the reasons cloud one is like,

450
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:31,290
I don't want to manage software or hardware, especially hardware. And also I can't

451
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,449
like Amazon is doing, it's like supermarkets, right.

452
00:18:33,459 --> 00:18:35,520
It's like 3 to 4% kind of margins.

453
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:39,510
If I run it, it's going to be way more expensive than that

454
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,719
and you'll get sick and die if I eat your,

455
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:43,569
I

456
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:47,199
just keep coming back to the fact that like developers just want to develop,

457
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,270
they want to get their code done. They,

458
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:54,219
the less things the developer has to care about or that just work or are just stable.

459
00:18:54,229 --> 00:18:55,319
Like a great example is

460
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:58,209
in my experience now, the majority of web devs

461
00:18:58,969 --> 00:19:03,030
cannot explain even simple networking concepts and you know what?

462
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:07,630
That's OK because every wi fi router or piece of network here you buy now you plug it in

463
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:08,650
and it

464
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:09,760
just works.

465
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:14,329
Now. Now I want to make a very important clarifying statement to all of this.

466
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:18,130
The importance of having people creating good usable container

467
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,079
images and good usable runtime for us is critical.

468
00:19:21,089 --> 00:19:23,839
Like if everyone said I'm done working on containers,

469
00:19:23,849 --> 00:19:25,920
the world would collapse in a week.

470
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:29,119
Well, so here's the thing you and I are ok, woodworkers.

471
00:19:29,329 --> 00:19:30,569
But mostly because we have

472
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:35,333
access to amazing tools. Like, I just bought a new cordless planar from DeWalt.

473
00:19:35,343 --> 00:19:36,243
It was like 300 bucks

474
00:19:36,493 --> 00:19:37,562
and I fixed a bunch of doors.

475
00:19:37,572 --> 00:19:39,613
Like there's a door in my parents' basement that now opens,

476
00:19:39,623 --> 00:19:43,062
that never in my life has fully opened because there's like a hump in the floor.

477
00:19:43,093 --> 00:19:43,723
Yeah. Yeah.

478
00:19:43,942 --> 00:19:45,162
And so, but, like

479
00:19:45,383 --> 00:19:49,402
I looked at buying a, like a shoulder plane, like a proper nice shoulder plane,

480
00:19:49,412 --> 00:19:50,562
Japanese one or something

481
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,223
again, it's like 300 bucks. So I'm like, well, might as well get the,

482
00:19:53,816 --> 00:19:57,485
and it's got a nice knob to adjust it from 1 64th of an inch to 1/16 of an inch.

483
00:19:57,706 --> 00:20:01,666
It is fantastic and basically an idiot like me can use it with, you know,

484
00:20:01,676 --> 00:20:02,885
I watched like two youtube videos.

485
00:20:02,895 --> 00:20:05,076
I'm like, ok, it works exactly kind of the way I thought it would

486
00:20:05,515 --> 00:20:06,145
and that's it.

487
00:20:06,235 --> 00:20:11,156
But the thing is so my level of expertise can be vastly lower with

488
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:14,855
a vastly better outcome because I now have access to this magic tool.

489
00:20:14,956 --> 00:20:15,826
The trick being

490
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:18,829
the people that built that tool are truly

491
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,630
experts.

492
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,650
And I don't mean just in the sense of like technical experts,

493
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,660
but like value engineering.

494
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,630
Like we built an amazing tool that retails at 300 bucks.

495
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,550
I could build a great planer that cost $10,000.

496
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:31,469
Right? And that's the thing. Like back to engineering like

497
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:35,780
you and I can build a bridge. Sure. Just give me all the concrete in North America,

498
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:36,599
you know,

499
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,349
but can I build a bridge that's actually affordable and will last like, say

500
00:20:39,449 --> 00:20:41,079
-- 100 years?
-- What's the saying?

501
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:42,800
It's anyone can build a bridge but only an

502
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:45,790
engineer can build a bridge that barely stands up.

503
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,930
My favorite is when the sewer line failed at my old house.

504
00:20:48,939 --> 00:20:50,449
And it's this stuff called cardboard Darow,

505
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,296
literally a cardboard tube covered in tar. And I'm like, what the,

506
00:20:53,446 --> 00:20:55,845
he's like, Korean War man, there was no steel and nickel.

507
00:20:56,076 --> 00:20:57,156
And I'm like, oh, ok. Fair.

508
00:20:57,326 --> 00:21:00,355
And he's like, yeah, the lifespan on these things is 50 years. What's your house?

509
00:21:00,365 --> 00:21:05,576
He's, I'm like, oh, my house is 51 years old, I guess I can't complain,

510
00:21:06,385 --> 00:21:08,916
you know, and then they replaced it with PV C that will last 100 years.

511
00:21:09,926 --> 00:21:12,715
And, but that's the thing, right is you get the knowledge

512
00:21:12,822 --> 00:21:15,631
kind of concentrated more and more into the small group of people

513
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,621
who then ideally take that knowledge and shoved into a tool.

514
00:21:18,631 --> 00:21:20,362
Be it? Software, hardware,

515
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,722
business process.

516
00:21:21,932 --> 00:21:26,641
Like how many books are there now? On business or on accounting or bookkeeping?

517
00:21:26,862 --> 00:21:29,121
And that stuff was like black magic 100 years ago.

518
00:21:29,391 --> 00:21:30,862
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, totally.

519
00:21:30,871 --> 00:21:34,722
Look at, look at the services you can use, you've got things like expensify and

520
00:21:35,092 --> 00:21:39,781
I ad P does payroll now. I mean, all of that needed an army of people before

521
00:21:40,459 --> 00:21:42,530
even simpler man filing,

522
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,449
keeping like finding your finding data in a file.

523
00:21:45,459 --> 00:21:47,750
There were people who were professional filers

524
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:50,239
both putting data into a filing cabinet and pulling it up.

525
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:54,319
They were essentially like a meat powered SQL system.

526
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,209
No. Seriously, right? Like

527
00:21:56,339 --> 00:21:58,609
the whole premise of the film, you know, being John

528
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:00,569
-- Malkovich.
-- That's true. Actually,

529
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,170
that's not the whole premise

530
00:22:03,209 --> 00:22:06,400
-- of those
-- pictures of like secretaries typing out letters.

531
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,479
No, now you just write an email

532
00:22:09,339 --> 00:22:13,369
dictated but not read. Nobody in our audience under 50 is gonna know what that means.

533
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,060
But that was a common thing back in the day.

534
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,260
Exactly. Exactly. It's so different. But at the same time, like this is cool

535
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,630
because I think this is

536
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,140
the kind of progress we all want, right?

537
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:25,290
Like if you look at human, just progress over time.

538
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,939
Like we started, everyone had to farm now, 3% of us farm, right.

539
00:22:28,949 --> 00:22:30,540
-- The rest of us can do other things.
-- Now.

540
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,180
Uh It's actually lower than 2% in the Western world. It's

541
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:39,619
no like you look at the size of those farms and farm machinery like, and

542
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:40,709
yeah,

543
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:41,400
that's,

544
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,969
yeah, but I mean, think about you've got operating systems, right?

545
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:46,550
It used to be, you had teams of people taking care of operating systems.

546
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,579
Now we have containers.

547
00:22:47,589 --> 00:22:47,750
Well,

548
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,180
-- the
-- rule of

549
00:22:48,189 --> 00:22:50,260
thumb used to be one admin per 10 windows

550
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:53,390
machines and one admin per 50 UNIX machines on the high end,

551
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,079
like, those were the good super competent admins.

552
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:57,319
And now it's like,

553
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:01,209
I don't think we technically have a server admin at the CS A because we don't, I guess.

554
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:04,520
No, that's not true. We still have three DEV systems running in Aws.

555
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,359
But, like, we literally,

556
00:23:06,369 --> 00:23:09,099
our production systems don't have a system in because they're a container.

557
00:23:09,459 --> 00:23:12,479
You don't need it. Exactly. We're, we're seeing that now

558
00:23:12,689 --> 00:23:16,150
with, with languages. right? These languages are becoming

559
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,479
the operating system from our perspective

560
00:23:18,489 --> 00:23:20,390
where it's tracking its security vulnerabilities.

561
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,719
I'm installing the packages.

562
00:23:21,729 --> 00:23:25,119
It's kind of doing some of the heavy lifting, but I still have to care and feed it

563
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:29,250
and I'm excited to see how we get rid of it because they will go away at some point.

564
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,760
It's so, for example, it's like networking gear,

565
00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:34,209
what networking gear

566
00:23:34,349 --> 00:23:35,449
is underlying

567
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,550
anything nowadays. Nobody knows or cares.

568
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:37,869
It

569
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:38,199
doesn't

570
00:23:38,439 --> 00:23:40,890
matter. IP works, you know, data comes in, data comes out.

571
00:23:41,229 --> 00:23:43,989
Same thing with the operating system now, essentially, even within a container,

572
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,140
right?

573
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,359
Like as long as it's Linux

574
00:23:45,569 --> 00:23:47,689
-- ish, I don't care.
-- Yeah.

575
00:23:47,939 --> 00:23:49,680
-- No one, no one cares.
-- It works.

576
00:23:49,689 --> 00:23:52,739
It'll work unless it's some really horrendously niche

577
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,969
version of Linux that's broken by definition.

578
00:23:54,979 --> 00:23:55,030
F

579
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:55,599
yo,

580
00:23:55,699 --> 00:23:58,930
the FIP stuff you have to care but everything else. Yeah, no one cares.

581
00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:03,969
And so then with languages we're, we're already getting there like, well for the,

582
00:24:03,979 --> 00:24:07,170
for the global Security Database, we have that thing running in Digital Ocean

583
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,930
where it literally just asks you for like, what's your github

584
00:24:10,109 --> 00:24:12,550
Repo? What's the subdirectory you want me to point out?

585
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,420
And then like three minutes later, a bunch of tech scrolls by and it's like,

586
00:24:15,729 --> 00:24:18,540
there's a website running with the thing doing its thing.

587
00:24:19,469 --> 00:24:20,069
And I'm like,

588
00:24:20,189 --> 00:24:22,540
it was funny because the other Josh was like,

589
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,380
I wonder how hard this would be to port to Heroku.

590
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,900
And I'm like, I scroll through the text. I'm like,

591
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:30,170
oh, it says like the container name is Hiroko something he's like, oh,

592
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:33,439
it's the Hiroko container. I'm like, yeah, it appears to be that I'm like,

593
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:36,329
I guess porting will be easy because we don't do anything.

594
00:24:37,569 --> 00:24:41,339
But that's the beauty. Right is Digital Ocean. Can use a best of breed tool.

595
00:24:41,709 --> 00:24:42,479
I like,

596
00:24:42,489 --> 00:24:44,270
I don't want Digital Ocean inventing or

597
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,260
building their own containers for their paths.

598
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:47,920
Go use a good one.

599
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:51,390
Yeah. Oh, absolutely. It would be foolish for them to do that.

600
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,709
Well, it's like a home builder. They don't make their own lumber.

601
00:24:53,719 --> 00:24:55,069
They go to Home Depot. Like the rest of.

602
00:24:55,589 --> 00:24:55,699
That's

603
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,989
right. Yep. Yep. That's a good, that's a good example.

604
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,930
Or nails or tools or any of that.

605
00:24:59,939 --> 00:25:01,150
-- You know,
-- the, the only, literally,

606
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,880
the only thing would be like snap on where it's just like as a mechanic.

607
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:04,910
I need my tool to work now.

608
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,550
So they have trucks full of tools that will like, show up an hour later and

609
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:10,719
-- hand you a new wrench.
-- That's part of their value add.

610
00:25:10,729 --> 00:25:12,989
That's why those tools cost a fricking fortune, man.

611
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:16,699
Like the thing is that is actually still available to you and me,

612
00:25:16,709 --> 00:25:18,500
it's just very expensive because of that kind of

613
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,250
they fixed delivery

614
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,619
and, and I don't care. I, I usually don't need a wrench right now.

615
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,579
I can usually drive to the store and get one.

616
00:25:24,949 --> 00:25:25,650
And I think

617
00:25:25,819 --> 00:25:28,300
it's similar when we look at things like this,

618
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:32,520
these go vulnerabilities that are being tracked as some people don't need to care.

619
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,859
Some people do need to care.

620
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:37,569
I'm writing a bunch of code for GSD and it's like, oh I need to, oh perfect example.

621
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:38,089
I need to

622
00:25:38,439 --> 00:25:38,449
uh

623
00:25:38,709 --> 00:25:39,339
CP strings

624
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:41,449
and obviously I could do it myself. But I'm like

625
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:44,010
I go to pp.org, I type in C pe.

626
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,859
There's a bunch of libraries and I'm like, oh crap, they're all really out of date.

627
00:25:46,869 --> 00:25:51,380
But then I'm like, oh pause CP was set as a standard in 2011.

628
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:55,609
So this library that stopped development in 2016 is actually fine.

629
00:25:55,939 --> 00:25:56,709
And I'm like, OK,

630
00:25:56,719 --> 00:25:59,599
I will go get the library literally called C pe and I

631
00:25:59,609 --> 00:26:02,300
will literally import C pe and it will fail because oh yeah,

632
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,810
you got to run pip three space,

633
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,489
install C pe. Wait about, I don't know, 20 seconds.

634
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:10,949
This is what you need virtual environments for now. Virtual environments

635
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:13,589
and that's the thing, right. Like, is it for me to get,

636
00:26:13,689 --> 00:26:17,329
for me to number one? Discover and find a package that will do what I want?

637
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,780
That's a hard problem.

638
00:26:18,949 --> 00:26:20,000
And that's solved now,

639
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:21,199
number two

640
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,280
to then install and get it working.

641
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:23,729
Yeah.

642
00:26:23,739 --> 00:26:26,790
P I three, install C pe, or, like you said,

643
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,560
I should actually be using virtual in for something a bit more sophisticated.

644
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:30,739
But I can't be bothered.

645
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:33,890
That's fair. That's fair. And if it's in a container it doesn't really matter.

646
00:26:33,949 --> 00:26:35,130
It's just running on my Mac.

647
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:35,900
Well, that's

648
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:40,530
like, I just know because it's so easy. I just don't care.

649
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:45,239
-- Well, until you, you have stuff crapping Python libraries. Yeah,
-- I don't care.

650
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:45,719
It works.

651
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,790
Ok. I mean, well, it works now,

652
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,670
-- like,
-- when it breaks here I'll go fix it with virtual Inver something.

653
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,010
But for now I'm like, don't care.

654
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,699
I've had that bite me though because I

655
00:26:54,109 --> 00:26:57,369
called one library and then there's another library with a very similar name

656
00:26:57,469 --> 00:26:59,089
and they both imported the same

657
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,280
and things

658
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:01,270
didn't go real good.

659
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,810
But anyway, anyway.

660
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:04,930
-- But, yeah,
-- like it's, but the thing is I can,

661
00:27:04,939 --> 00:27:08,040
that's the other thing is these tools are so good and high quality

662
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:10,489
that you can use them incorrectly and still get a good result.

663
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,709
That's true. Actually, I

664
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:14,609
-- mean, that's a good point.
-- Like, all I know is what the planar is.

665
00:27:14,619 --> 00:27:17,089
Keep my hand away from that 10,000 R PM spinning blade

666
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,790
as long as I do that

667
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:19,989
everything's fine,

668
00:27:20,209 --> 00:27:22,719
-- that
-- seems
-- fair and we're safety protection because man,

669
00:27:22,729 --> 00:27:24,349
that sends little wood chips everywhere.

670
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:29,069
Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah they do, they do and I mean I guess that's not unlike go, right?

671
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:31,229
Like you got, what's your safety gear?

672
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:33,479
Which at the moment it's things like you know,

673
00:27:33,489 --> 00:27:35,949
maybe pinning dependencies and installing updates,

674
00:27:36,189 --> 00:27:37,829
but once you've got that stuff in place

675
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:40,400
and you've got your your safety goggles on like

676
00:27:40,689 --> 00:27:40,829
you're,

677
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:41,780
you know,

678
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,959
that's really cool.

679
00:27:43,219 --> 00:27:45,469
That's really cool. Alright man, I think I'm going to call this one.

680
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:46,400
I'll give you the last word

681
00:27:46,609 --> 00:27:47,020
I think.

682
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:47,170
Well,

683
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,189
I mean this is this not the whole point of

684
00:27:49,199 --> 00:27:52,719
it is to automate stuff by taking people's knowledge and expertise

685
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:55,790
and a perfect example like something like curl where it's like, you know,

686
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,630
what I would love to see is like

687
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:03,260
see him give like a one hour on the most rare corner cases occurred more than once

688
00:28:03,569 --> 00:28:05,290
and I'm sure he would come up with stuff that would just blow

689
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,520
him around because I actually literally just tweeted at him a thing.

690
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,180
I had an idea.

691
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,020
I want to grab a whole bunch of web pages.

692
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,959
I just want the headers, I don't want the body.

693
00:28:11,969 --> 00:28:14,880
And so of course, the thing to do is to send the body to DEV Null and I'm like,

694
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,060
that's very wasteful.

695
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,739
I'm still downloading it and ignoring it

696
00:28:17,939 --> 00:28:19,119
and I sent him a tweet saying

697
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,699
can curl get an option

698
00:28:21,219 --> 00:28:25,020
to grab the headers and then send a TCP fin packet to close the connection.

699
00:28:25,209 --> 00:28:26,910
So I don't waste the data

700
00:28:27,229 --> 00:28:29,719
bandwidth and electricity serving the body.

701
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,520
And what kills me is at his scale

702
00:28:34,069 --> 00:28:37,160
that would probably save a couple of megawatts per day globally

703
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,030
because there are so many people that are just wanting to grab the

704
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,060
headers and ignore the body like it's all over stack overflow and everything.

705
00:28:43,729 --> 00:28:45,099
And it's something like that is a great example

706
00:28:45,109 --> 00:28:48,619
of a ridiculously small sophisticated change because like again,

707
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:51,040
I know enough about networking to be like, well with a web connection.

708
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:51,410
Yeah,

709
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:55,219
you could just close it with the TCP FIN packet and just not get the body boom done

710
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:56,589
and

711
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:57,119
write it in

712
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:57,489
Python,

713
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:57,890
you know,

714
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,609
and then we could have this option that literally

715
00:28:59,619 --> 00:29:02,709
will save megawatts of electricity potentially over a year.

716
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:05,579
Yeah. Yeah. But again, it's, it's, that's so specialized

717
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:06,859
-- but
-- well, uh

718
00:29:06,989 --> 00:29:09,030
ignoring the body is a very common question,

719
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,579
stack overflow and a bunch of other things.

720
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,109
-- But
-- it's not common.

721
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:14,310
I bet in the grand scheme of things, but in the case of curl,

722
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,670
they can address corner case.

723
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,670
Exactly. And that's the thing like that's what these tools can do is they

724
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:21,699
at scale. And with this degree of specialization, it's like

725
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:25,050
we made your lettuce 0.1% less wilted.

726
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:26,650
OK. That doesn't help me.

727
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:29,060
But it really like it helps society as

728
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:30,780
a whole because now we're wasting less lettuce.

729
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,369
That's right. That's right. I agree. I like it. I like it. Go l

730
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:36,599
lettuce. All right, I'm calling it. Thank you, Kurt.
