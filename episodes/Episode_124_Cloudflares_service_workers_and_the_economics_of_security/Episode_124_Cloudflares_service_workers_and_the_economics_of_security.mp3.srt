Hello and welcome to the Open source Security podcast episode.

1
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,720
100 and 24 with myself Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:13,189 --> 00:00:14,409
So I got a new desk.

3
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,219
I'm standing up right now, which is kind of a new thing and,

4
00:00:17,229 --> 00:00:18,909
and I guess I should also apologize.

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,299
I'm in a new office and it's probably more echoey

6
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:24,420
than usual because I haven't put any sound prevention.

7
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,139
Anything

8
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:27,129
-- in here. No,
-- I'm fine.

9
00:00:27,139 --> 00:00:27,489
I,

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,909
I actually have a sit stand desk that I had to unplug because

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,310
my one kid likes making it go up and down and up and down

12
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,419
and up and down.

13
00:00:34,779 --> 00:00:36,159
Right. It is cool.

14
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:37,189
Yeah.

15
00:00:37,389 --> 00:00:40,450
-- Something magical about simple machines.
-- I, I, I agree.

16
00:00:40,459 --> 00:00:41,659
Although in all seriousness, like,

17
00:00:41,669 --> 00:00:45,020
my goal is to basically leave it up forever at this point.

18
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:49,000
And it, it's been a little over a week and I'm doing ok. I can make it most of the day now.

19
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:49,479
So

20
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:51,349
-- we're getting there. Here's
-- the funny thing.

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,360
I found that I like the most about a sit stand desk.

22
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:56,990
It was really easy. It's like if you want to adjust the height for, to,

23
00:00:57,105 --> 00:00:58,515
it's perfect. Where you're sitting,

24
00:00:58,686 --> 00:00:59,346
you can do that.

25
00:00:59,355 --> 00:01:00,125
And I realized like,

26
00:01:00,136 --> 00:01:02,776
this would be really nice for like a dining room table or something because,

27
00:01:02,785 --> 00:01:04,405
you know, wouldn't it be nice once in a while?

28
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:07,236
No, like sometimes you're eating dinner sometimes if you want to go do crafts

29
00:01:07,536 --> 00:01:11,106
or, you know, like my parents come over and my mom's short. Right? Like,

30
00:01:11,255 --> 00:01:14,085
it's just, you know, having furniture that is adjustable,

31
00:01:14,136 --> 00:01:15,886
only office furniture does that.

32
00:01:15,896 --> 00:01:17,365
So it it's funny you

33
00:01:17,622 --> 00:01:20,681
that because I'm going to tie this back to a conversation we're

34
00:01:20,692 --> 00:01:22,611
going to end up with on the topic of the day.

35
00:01:22,622 --> 00:01:24,571
But uh the return on investment on that and

36
00:01:24,582 --> 00:01:26,692
the number of people who care is basically zero,

37
00:01:26,702 --> 00:01:27,232
right?

38
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:29,461
Because like good enough is having a table that just

39
00:01:29,472 --> 00:01:31,342
works and you don't have to worry about replacing a

40
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:34,041
motor in it every 20 years or probably every five

41
00:01:34,122 --> 00:01:35,472
because your kids will play with it and burn it.

42
00:01:35,482 --> 00:01:37,802
Do IKEA tables last 20 years. I feel like they don't,

43
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,529
not an IKEA table man.

44
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,430
I've been surprised an IKEA table last like, like here's the deal.

45
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,370
So actually I've got a bunch of IKEA stuff in my office because IKEA stuff is cool

46
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:50,660
but it's, it's not super high quality. But at the same time, I feel like

47
00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:51,529
there's,

48
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,910
there's one thing to be said about buying some furniture that lasts forever, like,

49
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:55,889
like a dining room table.

50
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,010
I'm cool with that. Right?

51
00:01:57,279 --> 00:02:01,800
Whereas something like a, a couch. I don't want a couch the last 20 years.

52
00:02:01,809 --> 00:02:04,639
Like my in-laws have, have a literally a 30 year old couch. I

53
00:02:04,809 --> 00:02:06,419
think it's gonna be 40 years old now.

54
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:10,059
And I'm like, this thing is, but freaking ugly. Like, don't get me wrong.

55
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,970
It's very comfortable but it is the ugliest freaking couch in the world.

56
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,570
It's like throw this thing away and buy a new one.

57
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,520
My parents actually had their coach,

58
00:02:19,779 --> 00:02:21,610
their coaches professionally recovered

59
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,479
-- but,
-- but at the same time, they probably paid as much for that is like new coach

60
00:02:25,619 --> 00:02:26,369
costs,

61
00:02:26,529 --> 00:02:26,649
right?

62
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:27,470
So

63
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:29,990
like at that point, just buy a new couch

64
00:02:31,149 --> 00:02:32,850
anyway. Anyway. All right.

65
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,389
So,

66
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:37,529
so the topic of the day is cloud flare has

67
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:42,330
built magic workers on the edge that are running V eight

68
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:43,479
V,

69
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,410
right? Running on V eight. That's fair,

70
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,440
which is the, the Javascript engine inside Chrome.

71
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,949
And the reason

72
00:02:51,149 --> 00:02:55,899
I think it's most interesting is they announced this and nearly every security

73
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:59,919
person I know started going on and on about how insecure this is

74
00:03:00,169 --> 00:03:00,720
and

75
00:03:01,779 --> 00:03:04,880
my take on this and, and my, my quick take is,

76
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,259
uh, it probably is more insecure than a container or a VM.

77
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,679
But the reality is it's going to be so freaking cheap.

78
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,720
-- Nobody,
-- I'm actually gonna disagree with you

79
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:15,240
and, and we can argue about that later.

80
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,080
-- But
-- no, I have numbers.

81
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:20,679
It doesn't matter either way because it's going to be so freaking cheap,

82
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,279
it isn't going to matter at the end of the day.

83
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:23,889
Well,

84
00:03:23,899 --> 00:03:26,080
that's so that's the thing cloud flare really

85
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:28,160
drove home in their blog is the density,

86
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:28,419
right?

87
00:03:28,429 --> 00:03:30,660
Like when you think about density of physical servers,

88
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,509
1 to 1 density of virtual machines,

89
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,070
maybe a 10 to 1,

90
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,990
if you're, it depends on the workload,

91
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,789
right? We'll say 10 to 1.

92
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,720
-- But with
-- provision and and provisioning tools are getting better and more dynamic.

93
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:45,820
But and that's part of the problem VM workloads, not super dynamic like yeah,

94
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,820
there's V MS that support hot migration and stuff, but

95
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,550
that's kind of a kind of difficult

96
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:54,720
uh containers definitely denser and definitely easier to move

97
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:56,679
around because if the container is built properly,

98
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:56,970
it's

99
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:59,860
you, you turn it on, it does its work, you turn it off

100
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,029
and, and I'm guilty of this.

101
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,479
I have a bunch of containers that are basically V MS because

102
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,229
I haven't,

103
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:08,440
you know, I haven't properly containerized.

104
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:12,809
I was gonna guess I bet more than half probably closer

105
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,149
to 80% of containers are just V MS because in fact,

106
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,339
I,

107
00:04:16,493 --> 00:04:19,873
I can't think of a single container workload I've ever deployed.

108
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:22,894
That is a true microservice. They're all just like small V MS.

109
00:04:23,283 --> 00:04:26,544
The reality is if you're not doing containers with AC

110
00:04:26,553 --> 00:04:29,794
I CD system continuously building them and deploying them,

111
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,033
then you're not doing containers, right?

112
00:04:31,044 --> 00:04:32,713
Like you're really not using them

113
00:04:33,204 --> 00:04:37,074
as they should can and should be used. Right. You're essentially doing VM.

114
00:04:37,084 --> 00:04:37,954
So, which, you know, it's fine.

115
00:04:37,963 --> 00:04:40,273
It's, it's, it's honestly, there's nothing wrong with that.

116
00:04:40,283 --> 00:04:42,463
Docker V MS are a lot less painful than like

117
00:04:42,829 --> 00:04:46,769
building of uh uh VM Ware cluster. Oh, my goodness. Yes.

118
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:49,390
So, you know, sorry, sorry VM Ware people.

119
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,809
But then the thing is,

120
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:55,209
well, but there are, there what's lighter weight than a container and

121
00:04:55,309 --> 00:04:58,690
force sort of forcibly, more, more

122
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:03,250
mobile and dynamic in as far as it runs here, then it runs over there,

123
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,480
then it runs on this machine.

124
00:05:04,609 --> 00:05:06,809
And that is essentially serverless computing,

125
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,290
right? With serverless computing.

126
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,170
And see this is where Google cloud went wrong at first, right?

127
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:13,869
They built an awesome product

128
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,609
for engineers

129
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:18,329
that for example, didn't have local file system state.

130
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,480
And so the problem was no normal person could use it

131
00:05:21,609 --> 00:05:22,519
because they're like,

132
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:23,100
what do you mean?

133
00:05:23,109 --> 00:05:26,250
I can't write to the file system and save those changes like my app like

134
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:27,690
everything just breaks

135
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,089
and Google of course is like, yeah,

136
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,350
but you just like big table and this and that and

137
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:33,519
all these other cool things and message buses and all that.

138
00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:35,799
And, and of course, you know, normal people are like, but,

139
00:05:35,809 --> 00:05:37,799
but I want to write to my local file,

140
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:38,480
you know, that's

141
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:38,920
right.

142
00:05:39,489 --> 00:05:40,200
And so

143
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:41,339
the thing is, you know,

144
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,579
it's one of those classic like Google built it before kind of everybody could,

145
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:47,380
could use it or, or, you know, really embrace it,

146
00:05:47,619 --> 00:05:50,070
but we're getting there now. And part of it is,

147
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:54,769
you know, people devs are finally, are not just being trained technically

148
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,929
on how to do this, but sort of the culture piece,

149
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:00,410
why would you, you know, instead of having local state use a

150
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:02,920
centralized database that, you know, all your workers

151
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:05,019
or better yet, you know,

152
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:07,880
don't do that and use some other magical system like

153
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:11,350
uh no SQL or some sort of shared state table,

154
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:11,779
whatever.

155
00:06:12,179 --> 00:06:13,299
Right. Right. And

156
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,119
the thing is so

157
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,679
the density cloud flare can get from this is basically 100%

158
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:23,019
right. They can get 100% utilization of their servers

159
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,540
because

160
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:28,299
if they can't run a workload on an edge on a specific edge node,

161
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,339
that's basically OK because they can just route it somewhere else.

162
00:06:32,109 --> 00:06:33,010
So for a latency problem

163
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:35,910
but and see that's the thing people don't get like about Amazon, right?

164
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,500
Amazon has three pricing tiers. You can pay by the hour

165
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,250
and get guaranteed resources assuming they're available,

166
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:46,019
you can pay upfront and reserve resources so that when you do need them later on,

167
00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:47,070
you definitely get them.

168
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:47,279
Right.

169
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,670
So for like the disaster recovery people or if you're running a long term workload,

170
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:52,019
that absolutely must run

171
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:53,640
and then they can pad out the rest

172
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:56,559
of their infrastructure usage with spot instances that,

173
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,019
you know,

174
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,839
they're very cheap and they might get killed

175
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:01,040
randomly

176
00:07:01,299 --> 00:07:04,869
because somebody else is willing to pay more for that compute time,

177
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:05,440
right.

178
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,739
And that's what Cloudflare is doing is

179
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,549
essentially building this business model where?

180
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:11,420
Oh, yeah, we can just run all our servers at 100%.

181
00:07:11,429 --> 00:07:15,279
And as we need more capacity, we'll add it because people are paying for it.

182
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,709
Right. So we'll have very little unused capacity,

183
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:19,829
right? Ok.

184
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,679
So we should back up for a second and just explain what the hack,

185
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,779
a Claude flair service worker is

186
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:28,910
that way there, there's good, let's face it.

187
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,910
Not everyone pays this close of attention to a lot of this stuff and, and someday,

188
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:35,029
maybe Claude Flair has failed.

189
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,109
And, and our future historians are,

190
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:39,640
are wondering where society went wrong and they're studying us.

191
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:43,190
And, and so anyway, cloud flare and, and here's the crazy thing.

192
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,989
They're,

193
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,089
they're very specific in their fact that it is called a cloud flare service worker,

194
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,970
not a cloud flare worker because apparently they're

195
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,079
intending on having more of these things exist.

196
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:57,019
And this first one is the service worker where they

197
00:07:58,429 --> 00:07:59,250
Right. Right.

198
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,700
And I don't blame him either.

199
00:08:00,765 --> 00:08:03,304
So essentially what they did is there is something called

200
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:05,945
the service worker in javascript which lets you kind of

201
00:08:06,075 --> 00:08:08,584
think of it as like intercepting an HTTP request

202
00:08:08,595 --> 00:08:10,625
and doing stuff and then sending it along,

203
00:08:10,635 --> 00:08:10,964
right?

204
00:08:10,975 --> 00:08:12,734
And like this is built into javascript.

205
00:08:13,144 --> 00:08:17,665
And so basically what they did is they've made this API available on the edge.

206
00:08:18,274 --> 00:08:22,464
So if you're using cloud flare, you can write a script to do something like the,

207
00:08:22,475 --> 00:08:23,945
one of their examples is

208
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:28,179
you can basically look at the request. And if there is a cookie,

209
00:08:28,369 --> 00:08:29,470
don't, don't go to the cache.

210
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,390
If there's no cookie just send people to the cache.

211
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,989
Because you're assuming, you know, they're just gonna get their

212
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,690
page or whatever. Exactly. Exactly.

213
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,510
And like that makes a lot of sense. Right.

214
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,210
Because essentially the way it probably works in

215
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:43,190
most instances is you hit a website,

216
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,640
it says, oh, you don't have a cookie.

217
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,409
Uh I'll serve you the static page or, oh, you do have a cookie.

218
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:50,830
Let me figure out what to do. Just like reddit does. Right. Right. Exactly.

219
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,489
And so by not hitting the website and going to the cache instead,

220
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,729
you obviously number one, save a ton on traffic and compute in your,

221
00:08:57,739 --> 00:09:00,070
your server room or server whatever.

222
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:04,890
And, and on the other side it's, it's wicked fast for people who aren't using.

223
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,799
Well, that's the thing people forget. Right.

224
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:09,849
When you, when you can serve something from a cloud flare edge,

225
00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:15,000
hang on a sec. Let me see how close my cloud flare edge is. Uh 19 milliseconds.

226
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,950
That's pretty solid, man. Right. And that's the, well,

227
00:09:18,109 --> 00:09:20,960
cre.org is hosted at a cloud flare. So 19 milliseconds.

228
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:21,739
That's

229
00:09:21,859 --> 00:09:25,580
nice. That's very fast. That's actually a lot faster than I was expecting.

230
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,270
Right.

231
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,299
Right. So, yeah. And most

232
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:30,729
so that's the thing people forget.

233
00:09:30,739 --> 00:09:31,289
Right is,

234
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:35,650
is if you're talking to a cloud flare edge that is only 20 milliseconds away and

235
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,349
that cloud flare edge is returning the content to you.

236
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,409
You're going to get the web page in

237
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:46,299
2, 300 milliseconds instantaneous versus going to the back end. Logging in

238
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:49,250
blah, blah, blah, half a second, a second, two seconds.

239
00:09:49,619 --> 00:09:50,340
Whatever.

240
00:09:51,109 --> 00:09:51,609
That's right.

241
00:09:51,619 --> 00:09:55,729
The other thing that people forget is that on the back end then you have a server.

242
00:09:55,739 --> 00:09:59,789
Uh, Yes or right, because with these cloud flare workers, as I understand it,

243
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,710
there's not really any limits to what you can do.

244
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:05,640
Like if you can build it in javascript, you can do it.

245
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:11,440
-- Uh
-- I mean, it, it sounds like it's not really designed to replace, you know,

246
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,479
kind of uh server side generated websites.

247
00:10:14,809 --> 00:10:19,690
It's more for simple tasks at, at this moment from what I've seen. Right? It's, it's,

248
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:20,229
it,

249
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:23,419
it seems like it's more of a let's intercept

250
00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:25,789
this http call and do stuff and granted you,

251
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,359
you could in theory like pre

252
00:10:27,489 --> 00:10:30,640
render a website and do other crazy things like that. But I have a suspicion.

253
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:34,750
That's not the goal here, right? The goal is to just do speedy content delivery.

254
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,929
-- Yeah. For
-- free, you get five milliseconds of CPU time.

255
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,210
For pro you get 10 milliseconds for business, you get 50 milliseconds

256
00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:43,619
and for enterprise, you get 50 milliseconds plus depending on the contract.

257
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,929
-- So you, you can build, I mean, if, if,
-- and, and that's per request.

258
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,789
Yes.

259
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:51,140
And so, I mean, that's, you know,

260
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,679
javascript running for 50 milliseconds can do quite a

261
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,840
bit of stuff or 50 milliseconds of CPU time.

262
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,400
Anything running for 50 milliseconds,

263
00:10:59,549 --> 00:11:00,169
right?

264
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:03,979
That's like 200 years uh 10 years ago and CPU

265
00:11:03,989 --> 00:11:06,030
-- time
-- and then a worker must make all of its subs

266
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:08,580
within the 1st 15 seconds of its execution.

267
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,469
And that's a soft limit after that period.

268
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:12,780
No new sub requests can be made by the script. So essentially,

269
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:15,630
yeah, you, you can't build super heavy

270
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:19,140
things that like are going on multiple backend databases and whatnot. But

271
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,039
you could definitely build something like

272
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:23,409
equivalent to wordpress in these without,

273
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:23,909
you know,

274
00:11:24,109 --> 00:11:26,109
straining on the CPU limits too much.

275
00:11:26,489 --> 00:11:27,059
Sure,

276
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,349
maybe I don't know.

277
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:30,140
But whatever the point is this,

278
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:33,570
this is a super cool service where essentially cloud flare is running it.

279
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,940
It's dirt freaking cheap,

280
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:37,609
which is worth noting as well. I read somewhere.

281
00:11:37,619 --> 00:11:41,549
It's a third the price of similar services in Aws

282
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,700
and, and now they're doing something

283
00:11:44,909 --> 00:11:48,989
insanely clever with this and it's what gets them the cheapness,

284
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,030
which is because they have incredible density is they're,

285
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,789
they're relying on

286
00:11:54,219 --> 00:11:54,489
the,

287
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,710
the V eight javascript interpreter itself to do the

288
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:02,219
process segregation and it's called V eight isolates.

289
00:12:02,229 --> 00:12:04,099
And this is really never been done

290
00:12:04,109 --> 00:12:06,440
quite like this before because generally speaking,

291
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,919
the attitude has always been well, OK, I shouldn't say that

292
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:13,710
-- this has never been done securely before.
-- Well, on server side, more on client side

293
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:16,960
like this is what gets me right, the V eight engine

294
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:22,719
is used in your web browser chrome. Well, I assume most people run Chrome now.

295
00:12:22,729 --> 00:12:23,479
Um but anyways

296
00:12:24,349 --> 00:12:30,010
and the amount of toxic junk that the average web browser sees online is over 9000.

297
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,179
And and I suspect part of the problem here is a lot of security.

298
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,890
People forget how completely ridiculously toxic the

299
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,450
internet has become for web surfing.

300
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,729
-- It's so bad
-- because they use an ad blocker, right?

301
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:44,210
The minute you start using an ad blocker boom, like 99% of your exposure is gone,

302
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:45,809
right?

303
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,400
Because most of these attacks are coming in through ads or ad network compromises or

304
00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:50,530
whatever.

305
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:54,729
So I was looking at the CV stats and, and they're remarkably uh

306
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:57,650
consistent for the last 56 years. So

307
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:02,530
2013, we had uh 11 chrome V eight vulnerabilities in 2014, we had 22.

308
00:13:02,539 --> 00:13:04,799
-- Now,
-- is this just V eight or chrome

309
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:06,130
itself? This is V eight

310
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:07,969
in Google Chrome.

311
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:13,820
Uh So 22 in 2014, 25 in 2015, 27 in 2016, 22 in 2015.

312
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,609
And then here's where it got interesting five in 2018.

313
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,630
And I know at first I was wondering

314
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,510
like maybe they started labeling them differently.

315
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,169
So I actually went through the CV database for

316
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:24,929
2018 for Google Chrome vulnerabilities and V eight.

317
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,409
No, that, that's five.

318
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:32,140
And I'm beginning to wonder, like, because they have spent quite a lot of

319
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,260
bounty money, you know, bounty money with P to own. Um,

320
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,289
they've, uh, you know, had their project zero.

321
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,150
they've been fuzzing the bejesus out of all of this stuff

322
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,989
and I kind of wonder if they're getting to that point now where,

323
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:50,289
you know, it's like if you eat healthy and go to the gym and then one day it's like, oh,

324
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:52,869
you know, you can lift that heavy thing without hurting yourself.

325
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:53,590
Right.

326
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:58,359
And, and I, I'm beginning to think maybe that's V eight chrome got there.

327
00:13:59,619 --> 00:14:01,440
Um, because the thing to remember, right, is,

328
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,960
is Google can basically see all the malware being served on the planet.

329
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:05,000
And

330
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,400
that's true because they run virus total.

331
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:07,869
And

332
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,679
so, well, well, not only that they, they literally crawl the internet. So

333
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,020
-- if it's on the internet, they, they
-- have it. Yeah.

334
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,510
Well, remember when they did that PDF

335
00:14:15,775 --> 00:14:19,965
project and they're like, oh, so we just decided to build corpus of every possible,

336
00:14:20,284 --> 00:14:24,695
you know, PDF thing that would exercise every possible PDF code path,

337
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,914
right? It's like 23 terabytes of data.

338
00:14:26,974 --> 00:14:29,294
So what, you know, that's a rounding error for them.

339
00:14:29,405 --> 00:14:31,835
And so I'm, I'm really beginning to think, you know,

340
00:14:32,255 --> 00:14:34,155
traditionally,

341
00:14:34,424 --> 00:14:36,775
one of the ways we pick technologies is we pick a

342
00:14:36,784 --> 00:14:39,945
company that is big and puts a lot of resources into the

343
00:14:40,174 --> 00:14:42,424
into the technology because even if it's not very good

344
00:14:42,434 --> 00:14:44,815
right now it'll continue to improve and be supported.

345
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:46,150
Sure.

346
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,809
And I can't help but think as, you know, as far as a run time goes,

347
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,299
right, a run time to run some code securely

348
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:59,349
but picking something backed by a giant browser, you know, mega company.

349
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:01,049
Yeah, that, that might be the way to go.

350
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:05,460
-- Uh
-- It, it, maybe, maybe I'm, I'm not, I, I guess let's let's even

351
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:09,510
step aside from this because I, I have a suspicion. You're right.

352
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,030
Like I haven't looked at the data you you've looked at, but

353
00:15:12,219 --> 00:15:12,409
it,

354
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:14,840
it wouldn't shock me because these guys have been

355
00:15:14,849 --> 00:15:18,369
doing enormous amounts of work on securing chrome.

356
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,039
And obviously when, when I,

357
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:23,849
I used to work with the Firefox people on security flaws and basically

358
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:25,690
javascript is the problem.

359
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,539
So

360
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,440
-- everything comes back to javascript
-- turing complete junk

361
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,719
from some random stranger running on your computer.

362
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,739
What could go wrong?

363
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:34,450
Now,

364
00:15:34,729 --> 00:15:36,309
now here's the thing

365
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,150
I keep thinking of is all security people are saying, oh my goodness,

366
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,030
you can't run a system like this.

367
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:43,250
It's going to be too insecure,

368
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,010
there's going to be side channel attacks and there's going to be people

369
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,299
breaking out of their containment and there's going to be people doing,

370
00:15:49,309 --> 00:15:49,789
serving man

371
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,715
doing things they shouldn't do. And

372
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,635
we've already had that with the browsers, right?

373
00:15:53,645 --> 00:15:55,604
We took away the high frequency timers,

374
00:15:55,775 --> 00:15:56,804
you know, to prevent that side

375
00:15:56,945 --> 00:15:57,705
channel like

376
00:15:57,844 --> 00:15:58,424
-- which
-- is,

377
00:15:58,434 --> 00:16:00,375
which is awesome. We've already, you know,

378
00:16:00,645 --> 00:16:02,955
all of these problems that security people are complaining about

379
00:16:03,405 --> 00:16:04,974
V eights already been through that.

380
00:16:05,395 --> 00:16:07,275
Like V eight is not a child. It's,

381
00:16:07,965 --> 00:16:09,914
but here's, here's the thing.

382
00:16:10,015 --> 00:16:12,395
I, I agree with you 100% but I wanna,

383
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:15,794
I wanna go even farther away from this conversation and say,

384
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:18,309
even if it's insecure,

385
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,750
even if it is,

386
00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:23,150
I don't think it matters because at the end of the day,

387
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,270
the things that win is price and I'm gonna, I mean,

388
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,210
this comes back to like the conversations we've had about like if I go buy

389
00:16:29,219 --> 00:16:33,260
an IOT light bulb and one says super secure and it's $20 and one's like,

390
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:36,510
eh, whatever and it's $1 I'm buying the $1 light bulb, right?

391
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:36,849
Don't

392
00:16:37,219 --> 00:16:38,070
care. It's insecure.

393
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,280
I have this skylink net system and so the ring doorbell I bought,

394
00:16:41,289 --> 00:16:42,349
I just got a ring doorbell.

395
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:45,460
You, you know, you pay money for them to store the video in the cloud.

396
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,049
That makes sense, right?

397
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,809
My skylink net system,

398
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,630
I can remotely view the video from my

399
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:55,340
skylink camera, but I have no idea. I need to go check.

400
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:58,460
Like, is it going to a server in China? Is it somehow because like

401
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,349
it can't the cameras behind a firewall on a like

402
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:05,348
not a real, you know, on a reserve IP address? Like an internal network IP address?

403
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:05,829
So like

404
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:10,410
-- how does that video get from there to my phone.
-- Magic. Don't ask.

405
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,140
-- Like, I really don't, haven't, I haven't bothered to look and I
-- just, you know, it,

406
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,489
it's super insecure.

407
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,319
Oh, totally, totally insecure. Right.

408
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:17,868
This is,

409
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,250
this is like that pain in your side that you don't want to

410
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,459
go to the doctor because you're worried it might be something bad.

411
00:17:22,479 --> 00:17:23,300
Yeah, same thing.

412
00:17:23,848 --> 00:17:25,250
Just don't look. It's easier.

413
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,619
But anyway, I mean, so that's my point. Right. Is

414
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,349
maybe it is more insecure.

415
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,199
It doesn't matter because it's cheaper.

416
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:35,329
-- And here's the most important thing.
-- That's the thing.

417
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:37,430
It's, it's not just cheaper, it's better.

418
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:41,000
That's true. Cheaper and better. That's true. That's a very good point

419
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,319
because, well, that's actually fair.

420
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:46,849
And, and that's another part of kind of economics that, that I think is worth,

421
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:48,920
worth talking about is the fact that

422
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:53,040
in, in many, in many organizations, people assume

423
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:56,630
that you can be more expensive and better or you can just be

424
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,739
cheaper and the same cheaper and the same is never enough incentive.

425
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,949
You need to be cheaper and better, basically better. You need to be better. Right.

426
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:06,050
You can be more expensive and better and win. You can be cheaper and better than win.

427
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,880
But if you're only cheaper, you're not gonna win.

428
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:09,079
Right. And so

429
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,290
that's part of it,

430
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,709
the cost of switching is high

431
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,130
and here's the other thing that I think people forget all the time.

432
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:18,589
Cloud flare is going to roll this out.

433
00:18:18,699 --> 00:18:21,530
Cloud flare is an organization with resources.

434
00:18:21,699 --> 00:18:25,510
Even if this thing completely sucks for the first year,

435
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:28,729
they're going to invest in it and they're going to make it better.

436
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,589
And let's face it like this is how javascript got better.

437
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:34,670
Javascript got better because people used it and it sucked and

438
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,469
they kept fixing it and now we've reached a point where,

439
00:18:37,569 --> 00:18:38,949
same as PHP.

440
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,780
No, PHP still sucks.

441
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,650
-- Horrendously
-- widely deployed.

442
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:46,819
It totally is.

443
00:18:46,829 --> 00:18:50,689
And actually in all seriousness, even PHP has gotten way better than it used to

444
00:18:51,969 --> 00:18:57,079
and now it's no Js. Right. Right. Exactly. And now no Js is a winner. Right?

445
00:18:57,089 --> 00:19:00,829
And no Js is going to get incrementally better over time

446
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,209
and, and like this is going to be part of that story.

447
00:19:03,219 --> 00:19:05,849
-- I have
-- no doubt here's the other thing that I find interesting. And

448
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,859
so I'm just trying to think about how I can phrase this without offending anybody.

449
00:19:09,869 --> 00:19:13,900
So a lot of these cloud providers have realized they can build things that they need

450
00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:16,420
that they can then sell on to customers.

451
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:21,199
And this is a classic thing, especially with certain types of um like

452
00:19:21,689 --> 00:19:24,719
just basically content provision where you provide highly

453
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:28,790
specialized content to people who kind of pay for it upfront.

454
00:19:29,189 --> 00:19:30,280
And in this case, it's

455
00:19:30,699 --> 00:19:33,260
quite often internal people that need this right.

456
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,569
We need this service or this capability to actually build

457
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:37,109
the thing that we want to provide to customers.

458
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,739
But then being able to very, to take.

459
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,339
So you've, you've sunk all that cost into building this thing

460
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,189
and, well, now you can sell it on to

461
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,790
the rest of the world at five cents a pop.

462
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:48,829
Right. Which,

463
00:19:48,969 --> 00:19:51,469
and let's face it when you're reselling compute time.

464
00:19:51,739 --> 00:19:53,260
That's what kills me about Amazon.

465
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,599
I, I was trying to figure out some of Amazon's margins

466
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,579
and so for like EC2, right?

467
00:19:57,589 --> 00:20:00,510
They're selling compute time, whatever, But like for elastic load bouncer,

468
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,719
they're, they're still charging you like,

469
00:20:01,729 --> 00:20:04,199
what is it like four cents an hour for an ELB?

470
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,390
And those El Bs are like, basically doing nothing most of the time.

471
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:10,939
And even when they are doing something, it's, it's pretty lightweight computing,

472
00:20:10,949 --> 00:20:11,479
like it's

473
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:12,829
packet shuffling,

474
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,859
you know, it's not deep analysis.

475
00:20:15,219 --> 00:20:17,189
And so they've essentially built value on

476
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:20,380
top of that kind of raw infrastructure that

477
00:20:20,489 --> 00:20:23,630
allows them to charge a premium. And that's what these Cloudflare workers

478
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,670
allow, you know,

479
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:29,920
they even a premium of 10 or 20% on what is essentially free compute time.

480
00:20:30,339 --> 00:20:32,640
That's, that's a huge amount of money potentially.

481
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,930
Sure. And it wouldn't shock me if these edge systems

482
00:20:37,189 --> 00:20:39,939
are already exist and are doing relatively nothing

483
00:20:39,949 --> 00:20:41,770
because they're just moving packets around and like,

484
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,250
let's face it.

485
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,650
We've gotten really good at shuffling packets, right?

486
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,489
So what do you do for the rest of the time?

487
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,939
-- You
-- know, as I understand it, they deploy, you know, they deploy to um

488
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,530
what is it now 100 and 55 data centers around the world,

489
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:55,050
they have like a rack of stuff

490
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:57,290
and I would assume they're just soaking up all

491
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,329
the extra compute time on all those systems.

492
00:20:59,469 --> 00:21:00,079
Sure.

493
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:03,800
-- That's cool. You know, because that's what I would shoot for. Right.
-- Right.

494
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,770
And, and that's the right. That's the dream. Right?

495
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,900
Is that if you have a machine deployed somewhere,

496
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:10,979
you're utilizing 100% of the hardware,

497
00:21:10,989 --> 00:21:14,449
you're having people pay to utilize 100% of the hardware,

498
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,500
right? No, no, that's,

499
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,939
I've seen a lot of places where they get that kind of they,

500
00:21:19,949 --> 00:21:21,819
they miss that second part about the payment.

501
00:21:22,819 --> 00:21:23,359
You know,

502
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,880
they have their machines doing stuff but not stuff that people actually pay for.

503
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:28,119
Look,

504
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,719
look at all these

505
00:21:30,099 --> 00:21:30,260
Bitcoins.

506
00:21:30,869 --> 00:21:33,359
Oh no. Iii I saw somebody seriously propose that,

507
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,119
you know, that we just

508
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,800
soak up all the

509
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,800
time, all the and no. Yeah.

510
00:21:39,109 --> 00:21:39,599
So

511
00:21:39,709 --> 00:21:40,229
I, and,

512
00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:44,069
and this ties actually back to a conversation you and I were having is that you can't,

513
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,729
you can teach people new things

514
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:49,550
but you, it's really hard to force people to

515
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:53,150
unlearn old things and replace them with new things.

516
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,310
Like basically you can add to a person's knowledge relatively easily,

517
00:21:56,869 --> 00:22:00,329
but to sort of replace or supplement core knowledge

518
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,630
is difficult. That's why, for example, we still have that

519
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,449
all that shenanigans around passwords, even though the n

520
00:22:05,569 --> 00:22:08,930
people have apologized and said we were wrong,

521
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:12,369
right. But people have internalized that to such a degree that it's like,

522
00:22:12,719 --> 00:22:14,699
you know, it's like calling their baby ugly.

523
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:15,500
So actually,

524
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:18,160
I have a great analogy for this because I

525
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,310
was actually discussing this with one of my kids

526
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,479
for an unrelated reason and it came so,

527
00:22:23,589 --> 00:22:27,760
so the reason that that kind of came up recently in a conversation is

528
00:22:28,219 --> 00:22:31,829
I don't remember the context of it. Oh, no, it was Tavis Ormandy.

529
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:35,060
Somebody made a, I'll look across the link in Twitter where somebody made

530
00:22:35,949 --> 00:22:37,280
was it was it Troy?

531
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:40,160
Who did the flow chart that basically said like you need antivirus.

532
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:44,060
And then Tavis did one that basically said antivirus is dumb use whitelisting.

533
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,160
Oh, sorry, that one. Yeah, that was Tavis and

534
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:46,829
I

535
00:22:46,979 --> 00:22:51,020
Right. OK. It's Tavis and I forget the other guy. I'll put it in Twitter. So it's fine.

536
00:22:51,189 --> 00:22:52,349
So anyway, anyway,

537
00:22:52,459 --> 00:22:55,920
and, and essentially I, I kind of wrote a little thing up on Twitter that said, OK,

538
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:56,650
look.

539
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,260
So

540
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,979
as funny as this is, as much as I want to agree with Tavis,

541
00:23:00,989 --> 00:23:03,780
I'm going to take an objective view here and say

542
00:23:04,089 --> 00:23:05,390
we don't know

543
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,869
if antivirus or whitelisting

544
00:23:08,069 --> 00:23:10,670
are more economical and the way I see it is there's kind of three

545
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,180
options and I would love it if someone did some studies on this is so

546
00:23:14,469 --> 00:23:16,209
you have nothing on your machine.

547
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:17,479
What does that cost you?

548
00:23:17,489 --> 00:23:19,349
There is obviously going to be a cost because

549
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:21,060
you're going to assume users will get malware,

550
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:22,750
you have to clean it up and I'd love it.

551
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,640
If someone with the resources would look at that,

552
00:23:24,989 --> 00:23:27,619
then you have a group of users with antivirus. What is?

553
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,329
There's obviously the cost of antivirus?

554
00:23:29,339 --> 00:23:32,420
Plus, there's still going to be some cleanup because let's face an antivirus,

555
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,310
lets things through

556
00:23:33,459 --> 00:23:35,170
and then there's whitelisting which again has a

557
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,349
cost because like managing the whitelists is nontrivial.

558
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,160
And, and of course,

559
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:41,239
I'm sure in some manner they're going to get some

560
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,650
malware somehow just because that's the nature of the universe.

561
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,010
Well, PDF. Right.

562
00:23:45,189 --> 00:23:45,650
And

563
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:46,630
right.

564
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,719
So anyway, think of it as you have three costs and,

565
00:23:49,729 --> 00:23:52,660
and I think three is too many for people to hold in their head and imagine.

566
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:56,430
So here's a better example. And this is where my conversation came from with my kids

567
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:56,989
is.

568
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,900
So they have in my city there is what's called the large

569
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,839
item drop off where you can basically take like large things.

570
00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:07,069
And for example, my, my glorious old desk that I'm, I'm throwing away slowly.

571
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,469
It has several, several pieces.

572
00:24:08,699 --> 00:24:09,670
I took one of the pieces.

573
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,780
I brought it to the large item drop off and basically you throw it in the trash, right?

574
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:15,520
And now there's like a big bin for metal. So it's getting recycled.

575
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,239
But, but anyway, you get the idea, right?

576
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,930
And it used to be, you just drive up,

577
00:24:18,939 --> 00:24:22,880
you throw your stuff and you leave and now they have a guy sitting there who

578
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:25,599
checks your ID to make sure you're a city resident

579
00:24:25,989 --> 00:24:28,400
because apparently there were people who weren't residents

580
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,390
that were dropping things off.

581
00:24:30,949 --> 00:24:32,959
And like, this is a perfect example though. So,

582
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:36,079
like the city knows how much they're paying someone to sit there.

583
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,969
And obviously I'm sure it's a nontrivial amount of money

584
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:42,770
versus they know how much they were paying to have all this crap hauled away.

585
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,150
Even when people were breaking the rules who didn't live in town. Right.

586
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:49,069
This is super simple. If the amount you're paying,

587
00:24:49,339 --> 00:24:53,239
you haul away the crap, you know how much that costs now you have to haul away,

588
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,439
we'll say slightly less crap.

589
00:24:54,449 --> 00:24:57,530
Plus pay somebody. Which number is bigger, right?

590
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:01,869
If it's cheaper to just let people cheat, freaking let him cheat. Right.

591
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:05,130
But the problem is somebody might have been throwing hazardous chemicals away

592
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:08,469
or tires. Right. Because here, for example, there's a tire recycling fee

593
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,199
and so

594
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,000
people will, you know, try and

595
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:14,469
yeah, but they've got video cameras and all that stuff. So

596
00:25:15,099 --> 00:25:15,130
they're

597
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:18,520
going to get your license plate and whatnot and, and let's face it like this guy,

598
00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:20,420
he's not looking at what I'm doing.

599
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:25,160
I could, I could probably have a 50 gallon drum of toxic waste and jump, dump it off.

600
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:26,410
No problem.

601
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:29,680
Because this guy I, I pull up, I show him my ID, he's like, oh, great.

602
00:25:29,689 --> 00:25:33,040
And he goes and sits back in his truck to probably play games on his phone.

603
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:37,380
-- Right. I could literally do anything.
-- Well, because I have a similar thing.

604
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:41,589
There's a, there's a garbage dump out by my parents' cabin that's open like,

605
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:43,560
four days a week and there's a guy there

606
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,920
and it's actually kind of nice because he, he's like, oh, you know,

607
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:48,699
dump that over there, dump that over there and dump that over there, right,

608
00:25:48,709 --> 00:25:50,239
and be careful of that, you know, whatever.

609
00:25:50,459 --> 00:25:51,680
And that's awesome. And he also

610
00:25:51,849 --> 00:25:55,680
part of it too is, is he kind of keeps a log of how many people are using the dump?

611
00:25:55,689 --> 00:25:58,380
Like, do we need to be open more days? Because for example,

612
00:25:58,579 --> 00:26:00,250
uh, my local skating rink last year,

613
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,239
they kept numbers on how many people use the skating rink

614
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:07,410
and it was essentially, there was less than 1000 total uses of the skating rink.

615
00:26:07,579 --> 00:26:10,439
And so they're like, yeah, we're not opening it this year because, like,

616
00:26:10,449 --> 00:26:11,800
really people, you know,

617
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:16,439
and, and so there might be some of that. But yeah, fundamentally, I agree. Like,

618
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,660
I've looked for that data

619
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,050
off and on for ages and my

620
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,859
take on it has been, you know, I, I don't use, I don't run a V on my Mac

621
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,719
or any of my systems. Uh,

622
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:30,349
I do run them, uh, the one mail server I run, I do run a V

623
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:33,880
because not because it catches viruses but because if I don't run a

624
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:37,280
V and a virus gets through and somebody complains then I get three.

625
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:40,010
Right. And that's, and that's a lot of these things are sort of like

626
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:42,660
looking at, you know, a lot of PC I compliance.

627
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:46,560
You have to have an antivirus, you know, scanner on all your servers.

628
00:26:46,569 --> 00:26:47,839
It's like, but this is like a, my,

629
00:26:48,052 --> 00:26:50,473
a Linux database server. Like it. What?

630
00:26:50,593 --> 00:26:52,032
No, that's not how this works.

631
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:53,412
I

632
00:26:53,603 --> 00:26:53,782
know

633
00:26:53,963 --> 00:26:56,103
we'll have to exclude the database tables anyways

634
00:26:56,113 --> 00:26:58,512
because if the antivirus touches them they'll break.

635
00:26:58,522 --> 00:26:58,753
Right.

636
00:26:58,762 --> 00:27:00,713
Like, it's not like it's going to be smart enough to like, oh,

637
00:27:00,723 --> 00:27:02,113
there's a record with a virus in here.

638
00:27:02,123 --> 00:27:03,262
We'll just sniff that out.

639
00:27:03,512 --> 00:27:06,083
-- It, it.
-- Right. Right. Right. Exactly.

640
00:27:06,093 --> 00:27:11,032
And, and so anyway, this is, this is kind of one of the failings in security I think is,

641
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:12,353
well, we don't measure anything.

642
00:27:12,442 --> 00:27:16,365
-- We just
-- don't, we, we don't measure, we don't know what's cheaper.

643
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,725
And, and I guess this is where, like,

644
00:27:18,735 --> 00:27:22,026
what Clown Flare is doing is going to win because it's cheaper.

645
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:25,816
Nobody's going to say, is it more secure? They're just going to say my bill is less.

646
00:27:25,826 --> 00:27:28,706
If I use this, let's use this full stop.

647
00:27:28,715 --> 00:27:31,686
Well, and back to the better two, not only is my bill less but,

648
00:27:31,836 --> 00:27:39,975
you know, I run c.org out of an S3 bucket. My total bill is like between three and $3.50

649
00:27:40,316 --> 00:27:40,946
a month

650
00:27:41,469 --> 00:27:44,650
and S3 is wicked fast to serve static content through, you know,

651
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,079
cloud front and cloud flare.

652
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:46,540
Like

653
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:50,119
-- it's just crazy fast.
-- Yeah, I need, I keep meaning to do that.

654
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:54,130
I've got, my website is still running off of a AVM

655
00:27:54,719 --> 00:27:56,780
somewhere. I don't remember.

656
00:27:57,979 --> 00:28:00,910
And anyway, it's like five bucks a month and the thing is,

657
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,099
it's cheap enough and it works.

658
00:28:02,109 --> 00:28:02,660
And I'm like,

659
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,459
hey, I

660
00:28:03,609 --> 00:28:05,300
don't think I care enough.

661
00:28:05,349 --> 00:28:06,219
See, for me,

662
00:28:06,229 --> 00:28:09,199
I specifically went to this so it couldn't really be hacked because like,

663
00:28:09,209 --> 00:28:12,010
unless you somehow get my credentials and get into the S3 bucket,

664
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,790
you can't modify the content. You can't like, you just can't monkey with it.

665
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,670
That, that's it.

666
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:18,119
Right. And, and

667
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,810
I, I kind of agree with that, I guess at the same time I,

668
00:28:21,819 --> 00:28:23,859
I'm not terribly concerned because this server is

669
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:27,189
literally running Ssh and Apache and that's it.

670
00:28:27,199 --> 00:28:29,040
Like I've turned off every single Apache

671
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:31,310
extension because it's only serving static content.

672
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:33,250
And so it's like,

673
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,550
I, I think until the day comes where I, I like,

674
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,060
have to do something because either some egregious

675
00:28:39,069 --> 00:28:40,849
security issue or they've end of life,

676
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:42,780
the operating system or, or whatever,

677
00:28:43,109 --> 00:28:45,300
or like the company goes out of business,

678
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,689
that's the day I will probably care.

679
00:28:48,699 --> 00:28:50,520
And until then I'll just keep saying I should

680
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:53,930
probably put that in S3 about every two months.

681
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:54,849
Honestly, the,

682
00:28:54,979 --> 00:28:58,130
the main reason I did it is I zero admin costs.

683
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,770
Now I just pay my $3.03 dollars and 50 cents.

684
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:04,530
I have zero admin costs because I completely ignore the machine

685
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,890
that is one way to achieve

686
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:09,989
-- costs are also
-- zero, valid way to do it. And that's a minor risk.

687
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,449
And in your case, probably so close to zero that we,

688
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:14,069
it would be difficult to measure.

689
00:29:14,209 --> 00:29:15,630
I'm right. Right.

690
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:18,520
If I was, in fact, that's the reason I turned off,

691
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:21,040
like all of the PHP script type things I

692
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,630
had running is because by turning everything off,

693
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,660
my, my risk goes to fundamentally zero

694
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:29,099
and, and yeah, I just,

695
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:33,160
so anyway, someday the risk won't be zero.

696
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:36,160
And I acknowledge that and that's where obviously something like S3 is nice

697
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:40,300
because Amazon will take care of the security updates for whatever it's running S3

698
00:29:40,469 --> 00:29:43,459
and, and I mean, let's face it. That's the magic of it as a service.

699
00:29:43,469 --> 00:29:45,479
And heck, that's even going to be an advantage of this

700
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,400
service is if there's a javascript security flaw, they're gonna fix it.

701
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,339
Right.

702
00:29:50,709 --> 00:29:54,699
Whereas if, if I'm running, you know, let's say a node application,

703
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:57,900
I have to deal with upgrading everything and, and let's face it.

704
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:00,079
I'm probably busy and I'm not going to do it quickly.

705
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:03,300
Well, that's assuming you even know about it in most cases.

706
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,250
Right. Cloud Flare has a dedicated security team

707
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,650
that too, I suppose that's fair.

708
00:30:08,709 --> 00:30:12,680
It would not shock me if they have people actually working with upstream

709
00:30:12,689 --> 00:30:15,010
on this kind of stuff because they'd be dumb if they don't.

710
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:17,130
I mean, you need that level of competence.

711
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:20,020
And, yeah, the way you get that level of competence is by doing it.

712
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,489
That's, see, that's the ugly truth in security. Right.

713
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:26,209
The way you get competent at security is you go do it. That's it.

714
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:31,050
That's kind of how everything works. Right. Like security or, like cooking

715
00:30:31,265 --> 00:30:36,255
some things, you can kind of learn from a book and get a good basis.

716
00:30:36,444 --> 00:30:38,255
-- Like what I'm skeptical this
-- is

717
00:30:38,265 --> 00:30:39,724
-- true,
-- Rubik's cube solving.

718
00:30:39,854 --> 00:30:44,655
I read the online tutorial and then II I solved my son's Rubik's cube form.

719
00:30:44,665 --> 00:30:46,035
It's, it's something where you can s

720
00:30:46,275 --> 00:30:48,385
you can follow simple mechanical instructions.

721
00:30:48,545 --> 00:30:49,824
Yeah, that's probably fair.

722
00:30:50,064 --> 00:30:54,484
So for example, a game like chess, chess is a really well understood game, right?

723
00:30:54,494 --> 00:30:55,545
Because we've invested,

724
00:30:55,685 --> 00:30:58,905
even before deep blue, we invested like that.

725
00:30:58,915 --> 00:31:00,775
I remember reading chess books as a kid,

726
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:05,209
right? Like the, the public library had a good couple of feet of chess books,

727
00:31:05,469 --> 00:31:09,359
-- you know. So reading
-- about, of, of all the incredibly darky things I've done.

728
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:12,329
I have never read a book of chess. Maybe it's why I'm not good at chess.

729
00:31:13,469 --> 00:31:13,790
Ok.

730
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,670
Well, I've maybe read several but, and I'm, I'm a pretty,

731
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,630
I'm still a very weak chess player because I, I don't have the patience for it.

732
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,209
But fundamentally with chess,

733
00:31:21,219 --> 00:31:23,380
like if you read three or four chess books and

734
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:25,839
just sort of mechanically follow what they say to do,

735
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:30,109
you will like stomp 99% of chess players.

736
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,089
Uh that,

737
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:34,290
-- that doesn't surprise me
-- and my numbers are probably wrong because they're made up.

738
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,170
But, but fundamentally the problem is chess is

739
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:41,750
it's a well understood static game. The rules don't change

740
00:31:42,989 --> 00:31:44,010
-- the rules,
-- right?

741
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,030
Same thing with the Rubik's

742
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:45,959
cube, right?

743
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,260
Cube doesn't change.

744
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,479
On the other hand,

745
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,329
it'd be like comparing, oh man,

746
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:54,810
that's a great analogy. Like we, someone, someone needs to build a Rubik's

747
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:58,369
cube that changes colors as you play. And like that is security.

748
00:31:58,459 --> 00:32:00,770
-- Well,
-- and also once in a while, a spike comes out of it,

749
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:02,219
I know I'm thinking about this.

750
00:32:02,229 --> 00:32:04,439
-- It'd be fun.
-- So you better be paying attention like

751
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:05,550
you

752
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,689
and, or once in a while it sprays a bit of mace out,

753
00:32:09,189 --> 00:32:11,219
right? And, or it gets too hot to hold

754
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:15,800
or, or it's, it, it won't let you move it in certain ways.

755
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:18,680
Like there's like little gears to keep it from moving certain ways

756
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,680
random. There's like a random timer in there,

757
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:23,900
you know, plus it's connected to the internet

758
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,939
-- that does
-- sum things up nicely.

759
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:26,989
All right. That's,

760
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,579
of course it is. That, that's actually a very apt

761
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:32,280
I'm going to think about this one a little more because I think we

762
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:34,750
could take that somewhere and I think people might be able to understand it

763
00:32:34,969 --> 00:32:36,369
and that's the problem with security, right?

764
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,949
Is, is fundamentally, everything keeps changing so fundamentally like,

765
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:42,609
I remember when containers came out, everybody, like that's not going to be secure.

766
00:32:42,619 --> 00:32:43,670
And I'm like, yeah, it won't be,

767
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,400
but they will make it secure because they have to make

768
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:47,349
it secure because they want to sell it to enterprise.

769
00:32:47,479 --> 00:32:48,349
Yep. Yep.

770
00:32:48,849 --> 00:32:49,430
That's right.

771
00:32:49,439 --> 00:32:51,349
And hey, look at now we're like, and that,

772
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:53,030
that's one of the things that I chuckled at is

773
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,750
some of the people I remember complaining about container security,

774
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,140
we're talking about how much more secure

775
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,900
containers are than this cloud flare thing.

776
00:32:58,910 --> 00:32:59,449
I'm like,

777
00:32:59,719 --> 00:33:02,280
I would, I would point this out to you but I don't want to get enough.

778
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:02,599
So,

779
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:03,770
uh,

780
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,099
so anyway, anyway. All right, man, I think it's time to bring this one home.

781
00:33:07,109 --> 00:33:08,810
So I guess, yeah, our verdict is, uh,

782
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:12,349
I guess two thumbs up for cloud flare service workers.

783
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:13,339
Good job. Cloud flare.

784
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,180
We, we, we should like, they, they need to send us t-shirts or something.

785
00:33:17,189 --> 00:33:19,380
I think we've given them enough free advertising. Right.

786
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:21,619
Well, you know,

787
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:24,349
I think they're fundamentally one of those cool companies like back, like Mozilla

788
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,319
used to be in the day or, you know, these companies that, that,

789
00:33:27,829 --> 00:33:29,520
yeah, that's fair. That pushed

790
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:32,599
not just a product but they pushed the entire industry forwards.

791
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,130
Yep, I agree with that 100% there.

792
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,349
I think the things they're doing are redefining

793
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:38,900
the way we think about nearly everything,

794
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:39,589
which is awesome.

795
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:40,400
So, good job

796
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,839
Kloer. All right, sweet. I'm gonna say thank you, Kurt.
