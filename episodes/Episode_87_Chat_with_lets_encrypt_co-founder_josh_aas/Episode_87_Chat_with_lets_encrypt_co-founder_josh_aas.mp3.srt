Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 87 with myself,

1
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,460
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,470
-- Josh Bresser.
-- Kurt. I'm excited today. We have a guest.

3
00:00:14,479 --> 00:00:18,930
We have Josh Os from Let's encrypt. Hi, happy to be here. Thanks, Josh.

4
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,180
So why don't, why don't you tell us a little bit about kind of yourself?

5
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,920
And let's encrypt, which, which I must admit, Kurt and I are huge fanboys of

6
00:00:26,729 --> 00:00:27,370
great.

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,879
So my name is Josh Os.

8
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,509
I'm the executive director and a co-founder of Lots and Crypt.

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,590
Although lets encrypt is actually the name of a service, the company behind it,

10
00:00:37,599 --> 00:00:40,819
the nonprofit is internet security Research Group.

11
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,869
And we started this all up in early

12
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:48,319
2013 mainly because I was working on uh networking security at Mozilla.

13
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,069
And it was really frustrating the slow pace

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,790
at which sites were transitioning to htps.

15
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,470
And from the browser side, there's not really much that we can do about it, you know,

16
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:58,830
sites either

17
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,369
make the switch or they don't and we just

18
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,790
have to accept whatever they do in the browser.

19
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,150
So I started thinking about with some colleagues, you know, what,

20
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,559
what needs to happen

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,510
to

22
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:12,709
help sites switch to HPS at a faster pace.

23
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,089
And we talked to a bunch of people about

24
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,580
what the hang up was and there, there are a bunch of complications.

25
00:01:18,589 --> 00:01:21,279
But the biggest thing that we, we heard was

26
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:24,639
that people had a really hard time getting and managing certificates

27
00:01:25,029 --> 00:01:28,370
that the process was really difficult. It also costs money.

28
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:30,959
It was hard to figure out exactly what you should be doing.

29
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,000
So we started focusing on this question of

30
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,129
a,

31
00:01:34,949 --> 00:01:38,370
you know, how can we make getting in managing certificates easier?

32
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,610
And another way in which this really came to the fore for us was that we were

33
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,599
at the time working on standardizing HTP two.

34
00:01:47,059 --> 00:01:48,449
And there was a big debate in

35
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,370
the U BC

36
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,800
working group about whether or not the protocol would require

37
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:53,930
TLS.

38
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,959
Ah Right. Right. I remember that.

39
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:57,330
Yeah,

40
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,569
the obvious answer on the face of it is that at,

41
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,569
at this day and age knowing what we know,

42
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,400
we should definitely not be making any new protocols that aren't secure.

43
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:09,690
That seems like an obvious piece of wisdom one would think.

44
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,119
But at the time,

45
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:15,190
there was a really great objection raised to that and I was,

46
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:18,630
I desperately wanted them to require CTLS.

47
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:21,600
But there was an objection that I just couldn't shake,

48
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:26,059
which is that if you require TLS, you will make htps.

49
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,000
Well, you, you'll make H TB two

50
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:31,020
much more difficult to deploy

51
00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:32,800
and you'll make it pay to play,

52
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,800
meaning you will not be able to deploy

53
00:02:34,809 --> 00:02:38,000
HB two without paying someone for a certificate

54
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:40,330
-- if you
-- want to talk to the world. Yeah. No, that's

55
00:02:40,339 --> 00:02:40,979
true. Right.

56
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:44,309
And you're a very unequal playing field

57
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,250
around the globe

58
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,639
in terms of access, price,

59
00:02:48,649 --> 00:02:50,669
things like that and in terms of education

60
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:53,460
and knowledge about how to deploy TLS properly.

61
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:57,919
II, I think that's super fair and I guess for some historical context here, for,

62
00:02:57,929 --> 00:02:59,729
for anyone who might not know is

63
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,410
prior to let's encrypt

64
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:06,309
getting a certificate was fairly expensive in many cases.

65
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,770
I mean, you're generally talking

66
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,929
50 to $70 a year in some cases, which

67
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,300
it doesn't,

68
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,990
right.

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,770
I mean, that doesn't sound like a ton of money necessarily, but I mean,

70
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,949
let's face it like when I was a broke college kid, I didn't,

71
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,770
I didn't have a TLS certificate.

72
00:03:20,779 --> 00:03:22,210
Yeah, TLS certificate

73
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,960
just because like that was, that was beer money. Right.

74
00:03:25,529 --> 00:03:26,380
And so in

75
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,800
and Right. Right.

76
00:03:27,809 --> 00:03:28,130
And then I,

77
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:29,770
I remember when L and Crip came along

78
00:03:29,779 --> 00:03:31,169
and you guys were talking about free certificates,

79
00:03:31,179 --> 00:03:35,500
I thought like, how, how on earth are the, are the Cas gonna let this happen?

80
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:40,229
And thankfully it did because your, your service is amazing and obviously the,

81
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,229
the price is right.

82
00:03:41,369 --> 00:03:42,259
And so

83
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,910
I guess why, why don't you tell us for, for a few moments, kind of

84
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,770
what is the fundamental model of how let's and crypt works because it,

85
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:53,339
it kind of deviates from the traditional universe of CAS.

86
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:53,789
Right.

87
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,600
Yeah. So

88
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,559
we wanna make certificates

89
00:03:57,789 --> 00:03:59,759
easy to use primarily.

90
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,600
And although sometimes people think of us as a free C A

91
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:09,240
free is really in service to ease of use, the reason that RC A is free

92
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,289
has less to do about not being able to charge some

93
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,250
very small amount and more to do with the fact that

94
00:04:15,649 --> 00:04:19,358
if we start charging people for certificates, it really complicates

95
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:21,760
getting and managing certificates.

96
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,239
So imagine your,

97
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,489
you know, it's just admitted a small company or let's say a huge company, right?

98
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,019
You're in a fortune 500 company and you want to set up

99
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,519
a little web server to do something that's not gonna be very important. Right?

100
00:04:34,929 --> 00:04:38,459
But if you need to pay anything for that certificate, even if it's a penny,

101
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,760
you gotta go find a credit card, you gotta get approval from finance,

102
00:04:42,769 --> 00:04:44,359
you gotta plug that card in.

103
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,549
You know, you're gonna have to pay attention to when that card expires.

104
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:50,160
So your cert doesn't stop and your site doesn't come down.

105
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:55,760
You've now taken what could have happened in one second with no thought whatsoever

106
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:58,519
and turned it into what a 30 minute

107
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,059
endeavor here if you're lucky. Right.

108
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,980
Yeah. If you're lucky. Right.

109
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,309
I can relate to this because previously with the cloud security line.

110
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,559
So I ended up actually,

111
00:05:08,329 --> 00:05:09,390
basically it was

112
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,179
not only cheaper from the number of certificates we needed.

113
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,149
But it was way less hassle to just get one

114
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,970
wild card certificate and use that on every server which,

115
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,709
you know, from a security point of view and compartmentalization,

116
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,609
sort of least privilege is terrible.

117
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,750
But from like making my life a whole pile simpler,

118
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,850
like only having to deal with one certificate every two years,

119
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,500
you know, it was a no brainer

120
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,630
so I, I can very much relate to that pain.

121
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,779
-- Yeah,
-- the options people had before sort of forced them to make

122
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,149
unfortunate decisions.

123
00:05:39,609 --> 00:05:40,109
Um

124
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:45,029
So free is so like I was saying, free is really in, in service of ease of use here,

125
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,350
right?

126
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:46,369
We'd like to get

127
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,429
our goals to, to get to a point where

128
00:05:49,869 --> 00:05:54,660
you barely even need to know that you have a cert or even what a cert is, right?

129
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:55,910
So

130
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,899
you should just be able to start up your web server and it gets the cert

131
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,820
installs it properly,

132
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,540
configures it properly and just handles the

133
00:06:03,549 --> 00:06:05,739
whole thing without bothering you about anything.

134
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:08,250
You shouldn't even need to know that the cert exists, right?

135
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,540
-- Um
-- I, I, I'll confirm that that's where we want to go because I'm,

136
00:06:12,549 --> 00:06:15,019
I'm using let's encrypt on my personal web server.

137
00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:19,109
And I actually was, I, I found some other service was,

138
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:21,260
was handing out very inexpensive certs

139
00:06:21,869 --> 00:06:26,529
and I had to generate my own certificate and, and get the CS R, right? Which took me

140
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,250
longer than it should I embarrassingly admit?

141
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:31,309
And then, and then got it and put it in place.

142
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,329
And then once a year I had to remember how to do this.

143
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:35,519
And then you guys came along and I literally, I have a script,

144
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,529
I run that's running in Cron

145
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,049
and I don't, it's magic, right? Like it's amazing.

146
00:06:41,059 --> 00:06:42,970
It's amazing what you people have done.

147
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:43,529
Yeah.

148
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,399
From, from an ease of use point of view,

149
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,619
even using the acronym CS R let

150
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,489
alone requiring your customers to actually generate one

151
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:52,799
is craziness, right?

152
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:53,519
Like

153
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:56,799
that's, that is so hostile to use of use.

154
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,820
It's, it's,

155
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,980
I guess we should also clarify CS R as a cer certificate signing request,

156
00:07:02,049 --> 00:07:06,399
which is kind of the thing you send off to the C A and, and they sign

157
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:09,910
and then give back to you. And it was, it's a terrible experience.

158
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:12,149
-- Yeah, it's really difficult to generate
-- that.

159
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,109
What I love is, it's so terrible that some cas

160
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:19,589
will let you generate the key and CS R on like via their web server

161
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,160
to make it easier.

162
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,209
And then of course, as we discussed last week with uh was it Trusco?

163
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,109
Yeah. Right. Right.

164
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:30,070
And the breach of 23,000 private keys, I mean,

165
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,910
yeah, this, this clearly is not a great system and not very fun.

166
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,760
Yeah, that's kind of taking it too far in the other direction.

167
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:40,119
You don't need to generate people's private keys for them

168
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:42,109
just to get rid of CS RS, right?

169
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:46,459
So, and one thing I'm not 100% clear on is, so what's the relationship between,

170
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,450
let's Encrypt and cbot?

171
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,440
Are they the same thing or different?

172
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:52,000
So initially, when lets encrypt started,

173
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,959
we had a client called Let's Encrypt

174
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:57,440
and we distributed that client

175
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,529
and it was developed partially with our developers,

176
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,070
but a lot of developers from eff as well.

177
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:07,559
And after some number of months of doing that, we realized that

178
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,730
we're never going to be able to produce

179
00:08:10,109 --> 00:08:11,170
a client

180
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:13,690
that works for everyone

181
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,890
or even the vast majority of people.

182
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:18,299
There's software deployment environments, you know,

183
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:20,299
different types of web servers and web server,

184
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:23,209
software operating systems architectures

185
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,760
there, there's a huge diversity out there.

186
00:08:27,109 --> 00:08:30,000
And the only way that we're gonna build clients that work for everyone is

187
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,760
to depend on our community to build the things that matter to them.

188
00:08:33,489 --> 00:08:34,080
So

189
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:38,340
the second issue we have is that we wanted our client, you know,

190
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,200
lots of crypto is built around an

191
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,808
open protocol called

192
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:42,409
ACME

193
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:45,158
automated certificate management.

194
00:08:45,778 --> 00:08:49,879
-- E stands for environment.
-- OK. Can I interrupt for one moment and ask, is that a

195
00:08:50,109 --> 00:08:52,979
acronym because I'm like a huge looney tunes fan. And when I saw

196
00:08:53,268 --> 00:08:54,518
Acme, it made my day.

197
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:58,318
Yeah, all of our stuff is named after like a road runner.

198
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:03,718
So the software that we use to build our, that we used to run our C A is called Boulder.

199
00:09:04,249 --> 00:09:05,359
It has a smaller

200
00:09:05,499 --> 00:09:07,708
smaller cousin named Pebble.

201
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:08,950
Um

202
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:11,010
We use it a lot internally too.

203
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,390
That's

204
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:14,270
ok. I'm, I'm sorry to interrupt. So, so back to Acne,

205
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,440
no worries.

206
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,530
So we use this open protocol ST standardized by the ITF,

207
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:21,979
you know, we, we started this protocol,

208
00:09:21,989 --> 00:09:23,960
but we moved into the standards process and our

209
00:09:23,969 --> 00:09:27,200
hope is that many CAS will use this protocol.

210
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:31,909
So we want all the clients that work with Lots and Crypt to also work with other cas.

211
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:35,210
And the problem with having a client named Lots Encrypt

212
00:09:35,219 --> 00:09:37,460
as you run into a bunch of trademark issues,

213
00:09:37,469 --> 00:09:38,840
when you have a client named, that's

214
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,109
Encrypt getting certificates from AC A that's not lots encrypt.

215
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,179
That's fair. So for,

216
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:49,500
for two reasons, we decided to, to stop producing a client. One is that

217
00:09:49,849 --> 00:09:52,859
we were not going to get the coverage that we wanted.

218
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:55,380
We wanted our community to decide what's important.

219
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:59,460
And also this trademark issue would require us to at least rename it anyway.

220
00:09:59,469 --> 00:10:01,260
So given these challenges,

221
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,270
um we talked to the folks at eff who are

222
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,140
doing most of the develop development at that point anyway.

223
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,059
And we said, hey, why don't we just make this an eff project?

224
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:11,429
You guys take the client rename it,

225
00:10:11,659 --> 00:10:12,429
run with it

226
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:13,989
and that's what we did. So

227
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:14,530
CBO

228
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,469
is the new name for the client

229
00:10:16,609 --> 00:10:20,909
and it is owned by Electronic Frontier Foundation now and they do a great job with it.

230
00:10:21,229 --> 00:10:25,429
That's awesome. That, that's very very open source. I like it.

231
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,979
Yeah, I guess my second question would be, are there any other CAS that support the

232
00:10:29,099 --> 00:10:30,150
Acme protocol right now?

233
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:33,359
I have heard that some do, I don't have direct experience with it.

234
00:10:33,369 --> 00:10:37,380
Um Often for automated certificate, certificate protocols.

235
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,309
For, for like a large commercial C A, you'll sometimes need to be a

236
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:46,750
enterprise customer or something with access to their API, you set up a contract,

237
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,229
get access to the API.

238
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,820
I have heard that some large CAS offer ACNE

239
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:54,900
as an API option. If you're an enterprise customer,

240
00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:58,000
there's also one or two other smaller CAS that

241
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,919
have at least been talking about doing it.

242
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:02,520
I think, I think one actually does maybe

243
00:11:02,659 --> 00:11:05,390
a Norwegian C A called bypass. Um

244
00:11:05,969 --> 00:11:07,830
I'm not very sure on the details of that though.

245
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,739
Nice.

246
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,190
-- Yeah,
-- because I was, I was wondering my,

247
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,549
my understanding of the ACNE protocols is just purely the technical side.

248
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:17,190
It doesn't, for example, have like payment stuff built into it.

249
00:11:17,479 --> 00:11:20,330
It has the ability to connect to a payment system.

250
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,559
So we made sure to do that so that commercial CAS

251
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,270
could also use the protocol. So

252
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,580
commercial CCAS are a really important part of the ecosystem.

253
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,479
They provide a lot of things that we don't,

254
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,390
they're really important part of the ecosystem and we want to make sure that

255
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,929
they're also doing things in the, in the best way possible

256
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,340
and coming up with a certificate issuance

257
00:11:40,349 --> 00:11:42,200
and management protocol is really difficult.

258
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,679
It's, it's really hard to secure those things.

259
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:49,080
Um, we've had a lot of industry experts. Look at our protocol.

260
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:52,669
We have paid for formal validation, cryptographic validation.

261
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:57,760
We've paid for many audits of the protocol. This protocol is, is pretty,

262
00:11:58,059 --> 00:12:01,739
pretty well vetted about, as about as well as you can do. Right.

263
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,969
I mean, there's always a potential for a problem but it's, it's a really

264
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,320
well developped protocol and

265
00:12:07,609 --> 00:12:10,679
it would be better for everybody if we all just used

266
00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:12,919
Acme instead of inventing our own

267
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:14,739
proprietary protocol,

268
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,989
that doesn't get that kind of community review and industry review.

269
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,630
So

270
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:22,250
we'd like to see standardization on ACNE for security reasons.

271
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,359
But also because it makes life much easier for people who are

272
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:27,590
getting and managing certificates, right?

273
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,739
So if all software works with Acne Cas,

274
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:34,580
then you can just pick and choose whatever C A you want to get a cert from

275
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,599
aim your software at that and go.

276
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:40,429
So interoperability and security are really important reasons why we

277
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,000
would like the C A industry to standardize an Acne.

278
00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:44,710
That is fantastic.

279
00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:44,820
Now,

280
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,809
you said something that's kind of spiked my interest

281
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,039
a little bit is you mentioned about having a

282
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:54,960
healthy C A ecosystem with kind of traditional commercial players that exist is

283
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,280
I, I guess I don't understand some of the goals of your organization.

284
00:12:59,289 --> 00:13:03,380
So explain to me kind of what is the vision you see in terms of of

285
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,140
the let's encrypt service

286
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:08,969
with, with existing, you know, kind of four pay cas.

287
00:13:09,469 --> 00:13:10,059
Sure.

288
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:14,520
So our goal at let's encrypt is to provide a free certificate to

289
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:17,500
people anywhere in the world in a really easy to use way.

290
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,979
I think that's an essential part of moving forward with the web.

291
00:13:20,989 --> 00:13:23,809
If you want to have 100% encrypted way web,

292
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:27,640
you can't require everybody on the web to pay for a certificate

293
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:32,229
and you can't require everybody on the web to be an expert who can, you know,

294
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:35,130
bre easily generate CS RS anytime they

295
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:35,549
want.

296
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,510
But you also need to support

297
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,700
people who, who

298
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,309
have other needs.

299
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,500
And at less encrypt, you know,

300
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,599
we work really hard to work at volume and keep things simple.

301
00:13:45,609 --> 00:13:45,960
But

302
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,250
people have means that lots encrypt doesn't satisfy, right.

303
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:53,080
So for example, we have one certificate lifetime, 90 days

304
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,039
if you want another lifetime.

305
00:13:55,049 --> 00:13:58,080
So I talked to a Fortune 500 company the other day that said

306
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:01,840
we would actually like lifetimes to be five weeks.

307
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,799
And at the moment, we don't support that. We're not able to

308
00:14:06,719 --> 00:14:10,179
tailor what we do to particular individual subscribers.

309
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,510
But that company is able to go to one of

310
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,380
a number of commercial cas and say here are my needs

311
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,380
and they'll cater to them.

312
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,059
Another thing that we don't offer directly is direct support. So if you,

313
00:14:24,869 --> 00:14:27,059
if you really want to be able to call someone up

314
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:31,260
two in the morning and talk about your certain issues you're having with it.

315
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,059
We're not, we're not going to be able to do that. We have,

316
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,309
you know, we,

317
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,869
we help secure something around 70 million websites and we've got a staff of

318
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,359
12 people full time. That's awesome. So,

319
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,390
support is not really

320
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,950
direct support is not really something we can do.

321
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,669
We do have great community support.

322
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:52,460
So we have community forums and we have a

323
00:14:52,469 --> 00:14:54,950
huge community that does a great job answering questions

324
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:57,510
and that works really well. But it's not,

325
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,340
they're not people that you can call up,

326
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,880
you know, whatever you want and talk about sort,

327
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,659
whereas commercial providers

328
00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:06,299
provide really great support

329
00:15:06,549 --> 00:15:07,799
or many of them do.

330
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,340
So if that's something you need, you know,

331
00:15:10,349 --> 00:15:12,289
commercial provider can make a lot of sense.

332
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:15,890
There's other cert types. Um Ovev,

333
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,210
we don't do that.

334
00:15:17,219 --> 00:15:18,729
Those are, are just,

335
00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:23,090
there's three basic kinds of certs we offer DVOV and EV are different,

336
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:24,510
different types of certs.

337
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,729
We don't offer those if that's what you want, commercial providers can do that.

338
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,010
The main reason we don't offer them

339
00:15:30,289 --> 00:15:31,890
is because they can't be automated

340
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:35,289
so they don't scale very well. But if that's what you want,

341
00:15:35,729 --> 00:15:38,039
commercial providers are happy to help you. So

342
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,799
there's a lot of, you know,

343
00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:42,929
we talked a lot about diversity of deployment environments already.

344
00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:46,530
That also means that people have different needs for CAS and, and we need

345
00:15:46,969 --> 00:15:49,239
a number of different cas out there to fill those needs.

346
00:15:50,219 --> 00:15:51,710
So, just a quick note for our listeners.

347
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:52,320
So the,

348
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:56,880
the three different kinds of validation are DVOV and EV and DV is domain validated,

349
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,900
which is literally a fancy way of saying,

350
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:01,359
you know, this site claims to be cre.org and

351
00:16:01,489 --> 00:16:02,070
it is

352
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:03,859
cre.org as far as we can tell

353
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,969
OV is organizational validated and there, they're actually validating, you know,

354
00:16:07,979 --> 00:16:10,239
the organization that's getting the

355
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,559
certificate that, you know,

356
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:15,369
that organization is actually Walmart or some bank or something.

357
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,440
And then EV is extended validation.

358
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,340
And, uh,

359
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:23,940
I'm not really clear on how it's that much different than OV, to be honest,

360
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:24,859
I don't know if, you know,

361
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:25,619
um,

362
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,739
but fundamentally for like 99% of the world,

363
00:16:29,179 --> 00:16:30,950
we use domain validated certificates.

364
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,169
And, uh, I mean, a great example of this is Amazon,

365
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:36,710
like Amazon doesn't even bother to use the fancier certificates.

366
00:16:36,719 --> 00:16:39,059
They just use a domain validated certificate.

367
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:41,960
And, um, so that I guess leads to my next question,

368
00:16:41,969 --> 00:16:44,840
which was so obviously let's encrypt and, you know, CBOT

369
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:49,409
will work for public facing websites that have a, a public name, right?

370
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:55,419
Uh Is there any plan support or is there any way to get, you know,

371
00:16:55,429 --> 00:16:58,489
free certificates for internal facing websites that,

372
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,409
you know, may not have a public name or may not even have a name at all and maybe just,

373
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:05,250
you know, an IP address of, you know, 10.0 0.0 0.1.

374
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,530
Yeah. So

375
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,770
there's one thing that people can do today, which is

376
00:17:10,108 --> 00:17:13,569
we can validate your domain using DNS records.

377
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:18,449
So one option you have today is to create a public DNS record for your server

378
00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:22,680
and then validate by putting the validation information in the DNS record.

379
00:17:22,969 --> 00:17:26,150
And then we don't actually need to connect to the server to validate.

380
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:27,040
So

381
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,709
let me take a step back here and say that there's three ways that, well,

382
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:33,469
two ways that we can do domain validation right now,

383
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,800
one is that we can contact the server and

384
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,069
have the server do something special to demonstrate that the server actually,

385
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,359
you know, is controlling the domain.

386
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:45,400
The other way is we can

387
00:17:45,709 --> 00:17:48,810
check your control the domain by checking DNS records.

388
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:54,000
So the advantage of DNS records is that we don't actually have to talk to the server.

389
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:57,599
So you can make a public DNS record for a server with the domain.

390
00:17:58,329 --> 00:17:58,939
And then

391
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,849
we don't care what IP address is pointing at because

392
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:03,510
we don't actually need to talk to the server.

393
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,790
We have, you do special things with the DNS record itself.

394
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,989
The downside of that is that it's harder to

395
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,949
automate management of DNS than it is to automate

396
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,209
certain things about the web server itself.

397
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,250
So that's the solution that's available today is to validate

398
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,890
with a public DNS record for an internal server.

399
00:18:22,209 --> 00:18:23,150
And we know a lot of companies

400
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:24,010
that do that

401
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,930
we have heard a lot of demand for

402
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,109
the space in general to make it even

403
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:32,160
easier for people to validate for internal servers.

404
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:34,880
It's a difficult problem. We are

405
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,189
thinking about it and

406
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:39,930
I wouldn't be surprised if it's something we

407
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,729
try to work on more in the future.

408
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,170
That, that is fantastic. In fact, I just had a conversation about this the other day

409
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:50,650
because one of the challenges you get when you're doing some internal TLS

410
00:18:50,979 --> 00:18:55,010
is your options are basically give a user ac A

411
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,930
that they have to somehow import into their client,

412
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,750
which let's face it.

413
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,219
Most people just end up with like a root C A that trusts

414
00:19:02,229 --> 00:19:05,739
star which ends up making you substantially less secure if you do that

415
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,989
or we train users to click the Yeah, everything's fine here.

416
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,719
Go away http S warning, which is also not good behavior.

417
00:19:12,729 --> 00:19:15,839
And so this is, this is a super annoying problem, honestly.

418
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,479
Yeah, we, we talked to some,

419
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:21,500
some large companies about this including large financial companies and they say,

420
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,640
you know, we're really trying to secure our networks,

421
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:27,280
but we've got 5000 internal servers that don't use TLS.

422
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:28,959
And

423
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,560
that's a, you know, that's a tough problem to deal with.

424
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,760
So I'm curious, what do you think? Because uh so actually uh what is it?

425
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:38,500
April 30th chrome is making one change where

426
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,469
they're going to require certificates to be in the, you know,

427
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:43,910
in at least two of the certificate, transparency logs.

428
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:49,910
Uh and then Chrome uh Google has also said that in uh what is it July of 2018.

429
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,359
So this summer build 68 of chrome

430
00:19:52,689 --> 00:19:56,550
is, you know, rather than labeling http S websites as secure,

431
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,910
it's going to start labeling http websites as insecure

432
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:04,109
sort of flipping the the default as it were from, you know,

433
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:08,910
being secure is good to being insecure or being HTTP is bad.

434
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,140
Uh So I'm curious what you think about this.

435
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:14,430
That's a really important step that chrome is taking to label

436
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,329
playing HTP sites is not secure.

437
00:20:18,339 --> 00:20:19,369
When I think about,

438
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,099
you know, the biggest day to day security disasters, we have

439
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,420
one of the biggest ones is that right now when you visit a web page

440
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,780
in a web browser

441
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:30,560
and it's not using

442
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:32,219
htps,

443
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,979
the browser just acts like everything is totally fine.

444
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:39,290
-- That's
-- everything is fine, right? Nothing to see here. Move along.

445
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:40,699
Yeah,

446
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,579
all of the web browsers are really,

447
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:46,459
really take security seriously, right? Like they've got

448
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:48,900
engineers who are constantly making security

449
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:51,420
fixes thinking really hard about security.

450
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,189
But then when we visit a site that's spraying

451
00:20:53,199 --> 00:20:55,839
your information all over the web with no security,

452
00:20:56,349 --> 00:21:00,750
the browser really just says nothing about it. Everything is fine here, you know,

453
00:21:01,229 --> 00:21:04,089
so it's really important that browsers start seeing something about it.

454
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:06,780
In addition to keeping people more informed,

455
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:09,260
it has a it's going to have a big impact on

456
00:21:09,619 --> 00:21:11,780
how many sites use htps,

457
00:21:12,109 --> 00:21:12,300
you know,

458
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:15,359
the availability of something like lots and crypt that makes it free and easy

459
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:17,939
to get a certificate will motivate a bunch of people to do it.

460
00:21:17,949 --> 00:21:23,660
Well, not just that, I mean, I think outside of motivation, if you guys didn't exist

461
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:28,640
Chrome and Firefox couldn't take these actions, right?

462
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:33,180
Just because I, I think the bar was unnecessarily high prior to let's encrypt.

463
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,060
Yeah. So the game plan all along has been

464
00:21:36,229 --> 00:21:40,250
for us to do as much as we can to deliver the browsers,

465
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,410
the numbers that they need to make this kind of thing possible.

466
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,599
They don't want to create warning fatigue for their users.

467
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:48,900
So they don't want to show a warning on every single

468
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:51,619
web page because then people just start ignoring the warning.

469
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:55,900
So the warning has to be rare enough that people don't start ignoring it. Our

470
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,920
job is to give the browsers that

471
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:01,280
the numbers that they need to start turning in on those

472
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:04,500
warnings and then make them more and more severe over time.

473
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:08,810
Well, and one thing I noticed too with chrome was that they were going to um

474
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:13,030
with the uh the transparency log stuff in April. They said basically

475
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:17,430
the main page will if it's corrected a load and if it's, you know, not

476
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,339
corrected will you'll get a warning but be able to click through.

477
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:21,359
But that the

478
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,859
third party elements embedded in that page,

479
00:22:23,869 --> 00:22:27,180
which let's face it as a fancy way of saying like ad networks and stuff

480
00:22:27,729 --> 00:22:29,150
simply will not be loaded.

481
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:32,310
And that struck me as a really kind of good

482
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:36,390
decision because, you know, you're no longer sending an alarm to the user.

483
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,349
It's just like, you know what this,

484
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:41,319
this third party element that the page wants to load, it's not secure.

485
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:43,680
So, or it's not, you know, in the transparency logs.

486
00:22:43,689 --> 00:22:45,199
So we're just not going to load it right?

487
00:22:45,209 --> 00:22:47,300
We're not going to tell the user we're not going to bug the user.

488
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,270
Um

489
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:52,810
And I'm wondering maybe if that's part of the way forwards is, you know,

490
00:22:52,989 --> 00:22:54,130
to essentially just

491
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,239
uh

492
00:22:55,849 --> 00:22:58,170
not bug the user and just not load the content.

493
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:03,290
Yeah. So there's, there are a lot of things that can evolve and how

494
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,079
web browsers behave and display information to users.

495
00:23:07,339 --> 00:23:07,989
I think it,

496
00:23:08,489 --> 00:23:12,270
the more they do to not load not secure content. The better

497
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,319
I think,

498
00:23:13,609 --> 00:23:17,800
you know, the first big step here is to label plain HTP sites

499
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:19,150
as not secure.

500
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:22,219
I think another important step that's gonna have to happen down this

501
00:23:22,229 --> 00:23:25,219
road is that the lock icon is gonna need to go away.

502
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,819
So right now you see a lock icon

503
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,099
when a page uses H gps,

504
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,880
that lock icon really overpromise things for users.

505
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:37,619
So when you see that lock icon, you might think, oh, this web page is secure,

506
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:40,819
it doesn't mean that it's secure or safe necessarily.

507
00:23:40,949 --> 00:23:43,339
It doesn't mean that the contents of the web page are safe.

508
00:23:43,349 --> 00:23:44,989
It doesn't mean you're not gonna get scammed.

509
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,020
It doesn't mean you're not gonna get malware.

510
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,420
It doesn't mean that,

511
00:23:49,089 --> 00:23:51,530
you know, the people operating the site aren't criminals.

512
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,979
It just means that you have a secure connection

513
00:23:53,989 --> 00:23:55,670
to whoever's on the other end of the line.

514
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:58,650
And I think people really don't understand that point.

515
00:23:59,089 --> 00:23:59,329
Yeah.

516
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:04,300
Seriously, man, I, I, that comes up all the time when I talk to non technical users.

517
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:04,890
Is there

518
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:07,609
like, oh, it has a lock, it's fine and it's like,

519
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,109
yep, sure is.

520
00:24:09,729 --> 00:24:13,670
It's not even worth trying to explain it to them because it's so complicated and,

521
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,489
and I feel like

522
00:24:14,939 --> 00:24:17,890
what, what you're talking about is totally correct of just,

523
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:18,449
yeah,

524
00:24:18,459 --> 00:24:20,810
stop showing it to people because it provides a

525
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:23,189
false sense of security which is super dangerous,

526
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:23,849
obviously.

527
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:28,729
Yeah. H gps shouldn't have a lock. Htps should be the new normal, right?

528
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,040
What you see today is your browser looks normal when there's no security.

529
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:38,479
When there's no htps, we need the normal state to be secure

530
00:24:39,189 --> 00:24:42,829
and get rid of the lock icon because I think it's really confusing to people.

531
00:24:43,109 --> 00:24:44,900
I agree 100%.

532
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:46,459
That's, that's awesome.

533
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:49,050
-- It'll take some time, but I think we'll get there
-- because I,

534
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:52,859
so I was looking at htps adoption and it's um from all the sources,

535
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:54,339
I found it's essentially

536
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:55,020
a

537
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,250
pretty

538
00:24:56,489 --> 00:24:59,160
like steady line headed up, which is good,

539
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:02,589
but like the slope on that line is not what you would call steep.

540
00:25:03,459 --> 00:25:07,390
And I'm wondering, um, like, what's the adoption you've seen?

541
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:12,469
Has it been sort of slow and steady or have there been upticks as these things change?

542
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:15,729
Like, are you expecting basically this summer to get hammered when you know,

543
00:25:15,739 --> 00:25:17,069
all the site operators

544
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:18,709
have their users freak out on them?

545
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,489
I do expect our traffic to grow.

546
00:25:21,699 --> 00:25:25,979
Um I, I expect it to grow pretty significantly as a result of,

547
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,989
of this change in the chrome U I.

548
00:25:28,189 --> 00:25:30,609
Once people see their site label is not secure,

549
00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:33,109
they're probably gonna start running around trying to figure out

550
00:25:33,219 --> 00:25:34,569
the fastest way to get a certain.

551
00:25:34,579 --> 00:25:36,819
And I think for a lot of people that's gonna be less encrypt.

552
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:39,810
I think the the really important number though is not

553
00:25:40,459 --> 00:25:42,760
how many certs we issue because

554
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:43,680
that

555
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:45,520
doesn't have a ton of context, right?

556
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:49,839
It it matters for our capacity planning, but the really important numbers

557
00:25:49,939 --> 00:25:50,719
and I think

558
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,069
these numbers are really impressive is that

559
00:25:53,609 --> 00:25:54,949
when LUTS and crypts started

560
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,430
just under 40%

561
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,349
of page loads on the web.

562
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:04,290
So every time someone loads a page that's a page load, just under 40% of the time

563
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,630
page loads used H gps.

564
00:26:06,939 --> 00:26:07,750
And that's

565
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,910
I think December 2015,

566
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,270
so late 2015 and that's 20 years of progress. So

567
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:17,150
SSL had been around for about 20 years at that point

568
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:20,109
that 20 years of progress. So on average

569
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:21,920
2% points a year.

570
00:26:22,099 --> 00:26:23,630
That's how things were increasing

571
00:26:23,969 --> 00:26:26,920
since then in the two, in, in a little over two years.

572
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:29,349
Since then, we're now passing 70%.

573
00:26:29,699 --> 00:26:34,550
So we're doing around 15% per year right now

574
00:26:34,849 --> 00:26:37,979
in increased htps usage in terms of page loads.

575
00:26:37,989 --> 00:26:41,300
And now do you guys know what percentage of that is? You?

576
00:26:41,619 --> 00:26:42,800
It's hard to say, right?

577
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:47,000
A lot of people put a lot of work into promoting a gps, you know,

578
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:48,670
browsers play a big role.

579
00:26:48,949 --> 00:26:51,219
Come on, man, I just gave you a huge opportunity to take

580
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:51,459
up

581
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,319
here. Right.

582
00:26:52,729 --> 00:26:53,160
Yeah,

583
00:26:53,489 --> 00:26:53,959
I mean,

584
00:26:53,969 --> 00:26:59,069
I think there is a big uptick in that number literally the day LS Encrypt launches.

585
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:02,439
So there is no question that we are a major driver of that growth.

586
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:06,260
Exactly how much I can take credit for, for lots encrypt,

587
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:10,439
you know, I, I'm not totally sure, clearly, we are a major driver of that.

588
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:11,319
Right. Right.

589
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,349
So we're doing about 15% improvement per year on the web. And that's crazy. I mean,

590
00:27:16,739 --> 00:27:20,229
I, I don't think that anything else has ever changed on the web

591
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:24,709
at 15% per year. That was so fundamental to how the web works, right?

592
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:27,410
Like you're changing all the bits on the wire and

593
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,609
you're moving the web at 15% a year right now.

594
00:27:29,619 --> 00:27:30,530
That's crazy.

595
00:27:30,869 --> 00:27:33,849
I mean, compare that to something like I PV six, right?

596
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:39,209
Which is a really, another really important thing that the web needs to move towards

597
00:27:39,619 --> 00:27:41,859
and that kind of adoption is really slow.

598
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:44,829
It's really hard to change the internet how it works. Right.

599
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:46,920
There's a lot of legacy stuff out there.

600
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:49,390
It's expensive to change stuff at scale,

601
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,540
15% a year is a stunning rate of change and we're doing it

602
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,859
and at this pace, you know, we're going to be almost at 100% soon.

603
00:27:56,869 --> 00:28:01,300
I, I think I would blame the web browsers for a lot of this because I mean,

604
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,660
look at web browsers today,

605
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,750
you you install your web browser and it

606
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,050
basically just takes care of itself after that,

607
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:07,229
right?

608
00:28:07,239 --> 00:28:09,410
All the care and feeding is magic and

609
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,780
users are almost always running the latest version.

610
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,140
And I mean, heck man,

611
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,319
how long did IE six hang on where sites were concerned about supporting

612
00:28:16,329 --> 00:28:18,449
it just because so many people were using it and it was,

613
00:28:18,709 --> 00:28:19,930
it was embarrassing,

614
00:28:20,069 --> 00:28:21,439
right? Whereas now

615
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:26,030
I feel like with the way what you see with Safari, Firefox and Chrome is, you know,

616
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,599
you're along for the ride whether you want to or not.

617
00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:32,430
So you can start doing some of these interesting things because you

618
00:28:32,439 --> 00:28:36,619
don't worry about people being stuck on some obscenely old version anymore,

619
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,060
right?

620
00:28:37,459 --> 00:28:37,619
Yeah.

621
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:37,869
Well,

622
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,790
browsers are actually a relatively easy way to move things for the

623
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,540
reason that you said they can quickly update many millions of people,

624
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:45,979
right?

625
00:28:46,489 --> 00:28:48,810
The problem is when you need to take it make a change to

626
00:28:48,819 --> 00:28:53,189
the web that requires action on behalf of people who run web servers

627
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:57,260
because that's not on the auto update train. Right? Like, yeah, that's fair.

628
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:57,729
That's fair.

629
00:28:57,739 --> 00:29:00,959
There's tons of different kinds of web servers and web server software.

630
00:29:00,969 --> 00:29:04,609
If you need everyone who runs a server to act, to make change on the web,

631
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,739
that is really difficult to do.

632
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,989
Well, I'm curious what's because that I've,

633
00:29:09,489 --> 00:29:11,619
that used to be definitely 100% true.

634
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,140
But now, you know, for example,

635
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,800
with cloud flare or actually I just noticed um

636
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,689
a few months ago when Amazon web services,

637
00:29:17,699 --> 00:29:19,420
they have the certificate manager now

638
00:29:19,699 --> 00:29:24,140
with well effectively free certificates. A similar model is less encrypt.

639
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,939
You have to register your domain and kind of prove that

640
00:29:25,949 --> 00:29:28,310
you own it and every what is it quarter roughly.

641
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:29,530
So I think it's 90 days,

642
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,959
you know, they reissue the certificates.

643
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:36,619
So it's definitely some of the large providers are definitely addressing this.

644
00:29:36,829 --> 00:29:38,910
And I mean, is that a general trend

645
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,630
you're seeing in the industry or is that kind of

646
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,589
limited to a few of these large players that,

647
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:45,689
you know, are typically a bit ahead of everybody?

648
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:48,199
Yeah. So centralization in terms of

649
00:29:48,729 --> 00:29:50,369
how web servers are managed

650
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,880
definitely makes it easier to make change, right? When,

651
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:56,060
when Amazon has

652
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:00,250
control over so many web servers, they really have the ability to promote change

653
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,910
relatively easily, right?

654
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,199
You're not talking about a million individual assist

655
00:30:04,239 --> 00:30:06,030
admins running the server under their desk.

656
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,540
Now you're talking about everything centralized in

657
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,459
one platform where you can sort of

658
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,310
apply medicine relatively easily.

659
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:16,060
So, centralization in web servers, you know,

660
00:30:16,069 --> 00:30:19,569
does have the upside of making change easier.

661
00:30:20,199 --> 00:30:20,869
So

662
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:24,459
we see big uptakes, for example, when

663
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,900
a large provider like, you know, squarespace or Wix or something like that,

664
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:33,540
there's many millions of websites on those platforms and they have the ability to

665
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:36,859
push a gps on those websites relatively easily.

666
00:30:37,239 --> 00:30:40,140
And that's great. You can get 4 million websites

667
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:41,920
by working with one provider.

668
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:43,099
That's crazy.

669
00:30:43,459 --> 00:30:48,400
So I I just realized something that when, when Kurt mentioned a quarterly,

670
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,739
quarterly refresh is,

671
00:30:49,979 --> 00:30:51,839
so you said that your

672
00:30:51,979 --> 00:30:56,140
expiration is 90 days, where did 90 days come from?

673
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,180
Well, the exact number of days,

674
00:30:58,449 --> 00:31:01,560
I don't, you know, we picked 90 seemed like a good number.

675
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:03,400
It's a quarter, right quarter of a year.

676
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:04,859
The issue is that

677
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:09,489
long, so long certificate, lifetimes have some problems associated with them.

678
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:10,579
So,

679
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:14,520
an important thing to understand before we get into why 90 days

680
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,349
is

681
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,739
that revocation doesn't work.

682
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:18,750
So there's this kind,

683
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,579
there's this concept of revocation that you can

684
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:25,729
revoke a certificate, so you can take a valid certificate and if something happens,

685
00:31:25,739 --> 00:31:28,900
you can revoke it and then people will consider it not to be valid

686
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:31,689
that doesn't work very well at all.

687
00:31:31,819 --> 00:31:34,699
The main reason that doesn't work is because some web

688
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:39,099
browsers including Chrome don't check revocation status on a normal basis

689
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:42,949
except for a short list of revocations for really important sites.

690
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,540
But almost certainly,

691
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,219
you know,

692
00:31:45,949 --> 00:31:49,209
sites that you and I are running are not important enough to be on that list.

693
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,550
So

694
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,439
if,

695
00:31:51,729 --> 00:31:52,790
if you revoke a,

696
00:31:54,099 --> 00:31:55,880
a certificate in general

697
00:31:56,239 --> 00:31:58,839
chrome, for example, is not gonna see that revocation,

698
00:31:58,849 --> 00:32:02,479
it's just gonna consider the cert to be valid until the cert expires.

699
00:32:02,489 --> 00:32:02,530
So

700
00:32:02,869 --> 00:32:05,640
that's the first reason that revocation is broken.

701
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:09,709
The second reason is even if you have a browser that does check revocation status

702
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:14,300
using a protocol called O CS PO CS P is a fail open protocol.

703
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,359
Meaning if you get no response,

704
00:32:16,479 --> 00:32:18,420
it's considered a good response.

705
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:19,459
So there

706
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:19,770
the

707
00:32:21,025 --> 00:32:23,944
is not a very effective way to deal with compromise

708
00:32:24,185 --> 00:32:26,785
once a cert is issued, the reality is

709
00:32:27,114 --> 00:32:30,064
you're stuck with that cert being valid until it expires.

710
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:35,255
Now, do you remember uh this compromise, the security issue called Heartbleed?

711
00:32:35,265 --> 00:32:36,614
I vaguely recall it,

712
00:32:39,239 --> 00:32:40,660
right? So

713
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:44,469
heartbleed was a security issue in some software that leaked

714
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:48,630
a lot of private keys around the world. Right? Suddenly, a lot of people

715
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:51,939
were concerned that their SSL private keys have been leaked

716
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,199
and the action that was recommended was while everyone

717
00:32:55,209 --> 00:32:57,359
go revoke your certificate and get a new C.

718
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,000
Right.

719
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:58,839
Yes. And

720
00:32:59,109 --> 00:33:01,040
I think that is still the right thing to do.

721
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:05,280
But I think we need to be honest about how effective that was, which is not very much.

722
00:33:05,619 --> 00:33:06,630
It was terrible.

723
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,449
I remember after heartbleed, I,

724
00:33:08,459 --> 00:33:13,849
I was using Firefox and I told it to hard fail on O CS P failures.

725
00:33:14,109 --> 00:33:17,300
And like the internet stopped working for me for the most fire.

726
00:33:17,859 --> 00:33:22,119
I think I lasted 15 minutes before I turned it off. It was just embarrassing.

727
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:26,920
I looked into it and the majority of the CS running O CS P responders

728
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:31,510
apparently had something like less than 90 like 9 0% uptime

729
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,050
on their O CS P responders for requests or whatever.

730
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:34,589
Like it was

731
00:33:34,699 --> 00:33:36,689
the failure rate. It was,

732
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,369
was just absurd. Like it's unusable at that point.

733
00:33:39,719 --> 00:33:39,930
Yeah,

734
00:33:39,939 --> 00:33:43,650
there used to be these horror stories about CS that had poor R CS P

735
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:47,400
responders because they didn't want to spend money on more ra M for the server.

736
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:51,520
Um It's a historically under invested thing, although

737
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,839
a lot of CASU use big C DNS now and the availability is much better.

738
00:33:55,849 --> 00:33:57,560
But anyway, when heartbleed happened,

739
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:00,920
everyone rushed out to revoke their certs which didn't really do much

740
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:05,469
and get new certs. So if your private key did leak during heartbleed

741
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,319
and let's say you went out and

742
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:10,958
you know, paid a lot of money for a three year cert, right?

743
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:12,840
And you did that last month.

744
00:34:13,129 --> 00:34:15,020
Now someone has your private key

745
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,739
and a cert that's valid for three years,

746
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:19,699
right?

747
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,750
And there's really nothing that you can do about it.

748
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,219
You're just stuck until that cert expires

749
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:28,418
Right. And that situation is why we,

750
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,899
we do 90 days certs. So that's encrypt

751
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:35,918
in a heartbleed scenario. All of our certs clear the system

752
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:37,389
in under 90 days.

753
00:34:37,728 --> 00:34:38,389
So

754
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,228
if heartbleed happened again,

755
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:44,870
all lots and crypt certs subject to something like private key compromise

756
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,668
would clear out of the system in less than 90 days.

757
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:51,320
And the incident would essentially be over for those people. I think.

758
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:51,719
So.

759
00:34:51,728 --> 00:34:51,929
That's,

760
00:34:51,938 --> 00:34:53,469
that's the reason to have a shorter cert

761
00:34:53,478 --> 00:34:55,830
lifetime in order to enable short lifetimes.

762
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:00,310
Right? Nobody wants to go get a cert every 60 days, which is what we recommend.

763
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:02,449
But the whole point here is automation,

764
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:05,300
you can't have ease of use of that automation.

765
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:05,689
Yeah,

766
00:35:05,699 --> 00:35:08,510
I was gonna say because part one of the things I run into is by buying like

767
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,260
two year certificates is I basically have to like

768
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:12,419
relearn the whole process every two years because,

769
00:35:12,429 --> 00:35:14,330
you know, I've forgotten it and, you know, having it.

770
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,800
Yeah, every 90 days either.

771
00:35:15,969 --> 00:35:16,199
Yeah,

772
00:35:16,209 --> 00:35:19,570
I'll automate it or I have to do it often enough that chances are I'll remember it.

773
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,100
Although,

774
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,820
hopefully, yeah, it would be automated.

775
00:35:22,189 --> 00:35:24,620
And I think that's something really important because, yeah, these things,

776
00:35:25,379 --> 00:35:27,320
you know, it's like people updating their

777
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,080
web browsers and antivirus, they do that regularly.

778
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:33,040
But how often do people update their, you know, their operating system? Right.

779
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,520
Because that only happens every

780
00:35:34,649 --> 00:35:36,669
couple and also people forget to renew their cert

781
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,070
in two years Right. Like who makes a calendar entry for that?

782
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,800
And then suddenly your c expires and your site goes down.

783
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,899
I'm totally guilty of that.

784
00:35:46,909 --> 00:35:47,350
Well,

785
00:35:47,459 --> 00:35:49,969
it just happened with the Oculus Rift apparently

786
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:51,570
yesterday or the day before,

787
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:54,840
apparently all the Oculus Rifts on the planet stopped working because they,

788
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:56,810
and there was an expired certificate.

789
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,270
Yeah. So the answer is automation. And if your certificate

790
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,969
issuance and management is automated,

791
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,169
then it shouldn't matter to you how often it happens. Right.

792
00:36:06,939 --> 00:36:10,889
Doing it every 60 days doesn't matter to you. If it's automated,

793
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,050
you can do it every 48 hours

794
00:36:13,399 --> 00:36:16,610
and it doesn't matter. Right. Please don't do that though. Right.

795
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,199
I, I mean, I think we may get there someday. Right.

796
00:36:21,209 --> 00:36:25,439
I think 48 hours is not a reasonable amount of time for a cert to last,

797
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:29,590
but it only works in a world where, you know, environments are very automated.

798
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:31,429
Right. Right. Absolutely.

799
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:36,760
We, that's actually a problem with, uh, some of, you know, some of our red hats,

800
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,909
cloud products, like infrastructure stuff.

801
00:36:39,179 --> 00:36:44,679
We do want very short certificate lifespans potentially because it basically,

802
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:45,500
yeah,

803
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:47,379
basically makes a whole pile of security problems

804
00:36:47,389 --> 00:36:49,219
either go away or become very minimal.

805
00:36:49,229 --> 00:36:53,020
And that, yeah, if this site or host or whatever is compromised or somebody goofs up.

806
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:55,070
Yeah, it's valid for like, 48 hours.

807
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:58,219
No big deal, you know, not a year or two.

808
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:03,120
and so personally I do think, especially for a lot of internal stuff. It,

809
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:06,330
it really does make sense to have very short lifespans because,

810
00:37:06,659 --> 00:37:08,419
well, going back to your, you know, your,

811
00:37:08,429 --> 00:37:10,979
your fortune 500 with 5000 internal servers.

812
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,310
Stupid question.

813
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,459
But like, do they have, you know,

814
00:37:13,469 --> 00:37:15,620
when they decommission a server is part of the process,

815
00:37:15,629 --> 00:37:17,500
they're doing the certificate revocation, which, well,

816
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,620
as we've just discussed is basically useless.

817
00:37:19,629 --> 00:37:22,659
You know, if your certificate is 90 days that's less of a problem.

818
00:37:22,669 --> 00:37:26,219
And if it's 48 hours then it's, well, it's effectively not a problem at all.

819
00:37:26,429 --> 00:37:29,260
Awesome. All right. I, I think, I think I'm gonna call it.

820
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:32,379
This has been a fascinating conversation, I guess Josh.

821
00:37:32,389 --> 00:37:34,060
Do you have any closing thoughts

822
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,179
for the audience?

823
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,659
If your site is not, uh using htps,

824
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,479
make it, use htps

825
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,209
can help. We're happy to help.

826
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:45,820
If not, there's lots of other cas out there.

827
00:37:46,179 --> 00:37:46,919
Awesome. Yeah, and the,

828
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:49,969
-- the clock's ticking.
-- Well, thanks for having me. It was nice talking to you.

829
00:37:50,149 --> 00:37:54,709
It was fantastic. I, I appreciate the time and yeah, definitely.

830
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:56,639
Anytime you want to come back, you let us know we'd,

831

we'd love to hear what you guys are up to and, and what's going on,

832
00:37:59,189 --> 00:38:01,979
that's encrypt is definitely one of the, the good ones

833
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:05,310
out there. So. All right. Awesome. So, so thank you, Josh. Thank you, Kurt.

834
