Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 187 with myself,

1
00:00:09,899 --> 00:00:12,399
Kurt Siegfried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:16,850
So I have a fun story. I don't, I don't usually have stories that have happy endings.

3
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,430
So just as a, as a warning, it has a happy ending. So

4
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:21,690
I bought

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,399
the Nintendo Switch on launch day, which was more than three years ago at this point.

6
00:00:27,409 --> 00:00:30,280
And a couple of weeks ago, the fans started making

7
00:00:30,385 --> 00:00:32,366
terrible noises on the switch.

8
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:36,765
-- So the switch has a fan built into the little thing it does.
-- It has a fan inside of

9
00:00:36,776 --> 00:00:36,886
it.

10
00:00:36,895 --> 00:00:38,585
I've never seen a switch. I've never handled one.

11
00:00:38,736 --> 00:00:40,085
Yeah. Well, you can't tell.

12
00:00:40,096 --> 00:00:42,846
I mean, it's, it's pretty small but there is a tiny fan in it.

13
00:00:42,855 --> 00:00:44,745
I mean, obviously, depending upon what you're doing,

14
00:00:44,756 --> 00:00:47,846
it runs at different speeds and when you have it docked to the TV,

15
00:00:47,855 --> 00:00:52,206
the fan runs harder than it does say if you're holding it in your hands.

16
00:00:52,226 --> 00:00:53,186
Right. So anyway,

17
00:00:53,355 --> 00:00:55,326
the fan on the switch starts sounding

18
00:00:55,692 --> 00:00:57,071
like a jet engine like a cracked ball

19
00:00:57,172 --> 00:01:00,832
burn or something. No idea. Doesn't matter. It's really small. So anyway,

20
00:01:01,032 --> 00:01:05,931
I call Nintendo and I say, hey, the fan is making a ton of noise and they ask me

21
00:01:06,061 --> 00:01:09,681
an absurd number of questions. Like, did you install the updates?

22
00:01:09,692 --> 00:01:12,681
We would, you know, check this, check that I'm like, it's just the fan is bad.

23
00:01:12,692 --> 00:01:14,412
-- Just please
-- in fairness though.

24
00:01:14,421 --> 00:01:14,592
Like,

25
00:01:14,601 --> 00:01:17,171
look at all the Macs that had all those wacky thermal throttling

26
00:01:17,181 --> 00:01:19,772
problems until there was a software update that magically fixed them.

27
00:01:19,781 --> 00:01:20,332
Maybe.

28
00:01:20,477 --> 00:01:23,078
Except I just kept telling the person I'm talking to on the phone.

29
00:01:23,087 --> 00:01:27,218
I'm like the fan sounds like a jet engine. The fan is bad.

30
00:01:27,227 --> 00:01:31,318
Well, let's see if you have the latest system update and I'm thinking the fan is bad.

31
00:01:31,328 --> 00:01:32,138
Literally,

32
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:32,367
I

33
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:37,188
did, of course, but it does not matter. The fan is bad. I want a new fan.

34
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:40,458
So after spending way more time on the phone than I was comfortable with,

35
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:42,938
they finally tell me, ok, we can fix this.

36
00:01:42,947 --> 00:01:45,407
But basically the, the fans going to cost me 100

37
00:01:45,594 --> 00:01:46,054
bucks,

38
00:01:47,213 --> 00:01:49,293
but then there's shipping and there's tax.

39
00:01:49,304 --> 00:01:51,734
So it's going to come to like 100 and 20 when it's all done.

40
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:56,263
And I said that doesn't sound like the best investment in the world to,

41
00:01:56,274 --> 00:01:58,863
to fix my three year old switch.

42
00:01:58,874 --> 00:02:01,763
When a, the handheld switch, the little one there's,

43
00:02:01,774 --> 00:02:07,674
I think it's called the Light is $199 and a regular switch is, I think uh,

44
00:02:07,683 --> 00:02:09,583
$300 like 299.

45
00:02:09,592 --> 00:02:10,383
Right. So

46
00:02:10,809 --> 00:02:10,830
I

47
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:14,449
said, I don't, I don't think that's a good idea. I'm not going to send you my switch.

48
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,820
And so of course, the next thing I did is I look on Amazon and thought,

49
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,630
I wonder how much a fan costs on Amazon.

50
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:22,149
I'm guessing $4.16 dollars.

51
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:23,990
Yes. Which was more than I expected.

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,389
And, and so I buy the fan, I also bought a tool set because of course, Nintendo.

53
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:29,679
So all the screws are weird.

54
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,789
And that's cool though because I enjoy owning the weird tools.

55
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,020
So now I've got all these funky screwdrivers but no, I

56
00:02:35,149 --> 00:02:36,766
it was, it was cool crazy man.

57
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:40,675
I had to like take this thing apart an incredible amount.

58
00:02:40,686 --> 00:02:40,886
I,

59
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:44,895
I'd removed way more from the switch than I expected to replace

60
00:02:44,906 --> 00:02:47,166
the fan and it just the whole time I'm doing it.

61
00:02:47,175 --> 00:02:50,966
I kept thinking that whoever designed this never imagined

62
00:02:50,975 --> 00:02:53,005
anyone would ever have to replace the fan.

63
00:02:53,016 --> 00:02:53,425
It's

64
00:02:53,535 --> 00:02:56,406
not that they never imagined anybody would replace the fan, but it was,

65
00:02:56,416 --> 00:03:00,115
it costs more time and engineering and

66
00:03:00,395 --> 00:03:01,485
processing and manufacture

67
00:03:02,061 --> 00:03:05,022
-- to build something that is user serviceable
-- even.

68
00:03:05,031 --> 00:03:06,742
But even when they do it,

69
00:03:06,751 --> 00:03:10,382
I understand why they charge $100 to replace this stupid thing because it,

70
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:13,072
it was a crazy amount of work to get at the fan.

71
00:03:13,082 --> 00:03:14,942
But anyway, my switch is fine.

72
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:16,462
The fan works

73
00:03:16,682 --> 00:03:17,962
and I am happy.

74
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,281
So There you go.

75
00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:19,742
That's my,

76
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:23,031
that's my happy story about my Nintendo switch and I figure in like a

77
00:03:23,042 --> 00:03:25,632
month it'll probably explode or something because I'm sure I screwed it up.

78
00:03:25,641 --> 00:03:27,707
But, yeah. Yeah, there were no left over pieces.

79
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:28,817
Yeah, I'm just looking at it.

80
00:03:28,828 --> 00:03:32,757
Is this pretty classic, like apple style, you know, glue, the thing together,

81
00:03:32,768 --> 00:03:34,718
lots of little screws, stuff is buried.

82
00:03:34,727 --> 00:03:40,117
-- So
-- there was no, like glue or the little clicky plastic tabs or anything.

83
00:03:40,128 --> 00:03:44,498
I mean, once I took screws off, things basically lifted apart, which was quite nice.

84
00:03:44,707 --> 00:03:47,057
-- OK.
-- It looked like they were using a spudger to rip something open.

85
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:49,298
-- Here in this picture,
-- I did not need a spudger.

86
00:03:49,307 --> 00:03:52,227
Well, what I needed the spudger for was there's some of those,

87
00:03:52,544 --> 00:03:54,354
I don't even know what kind of connectors they are,

88
00:03:54,363 --> 00:03:57,733
but it's where you have the connector that kind of clicks into the other connector.

89
00:03:57,744 --> 00:04:00,423
-- Yeah. The flat ribbon connectors.
-- Yeah. Kind of like those.

90
00:04:00,434 --> 00:04:04,044
-- Yeah, those things scare me because they're so easy to mess up.
-- That was my concern.

91
00:04:04,054 --> 00:04:04,423
But again,

92
00:04:04,434 --> 00:04:07,703
I figured what's the worst I'm going to do is I'm going to go buy a switch mini

93
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:08,774
because

94
00:04:08,914 --> 00:04:13,833
-- Yeah. Right. So anyway, $16 later, that's my, that's my happy story
-- today.

95
00:04:13,843 --> 00:04:16,053
I was thinking there's been a bit of recent,

96
00:04:16,253 --> 00:04:18,140
I don't want to say controversy because it's on hacker news.

97
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:20,988
So it's just a bunch of crazy people arguing about crazy things.

98
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,059
But um

99
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,390
it was an interesting point.

100
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:26,510
So Wire Guard is becoming more mature,

101
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:29,820
although I would argue it's definitely out of beta and ready for prime time.

102
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,269
Oh, yeah, definitely.

103
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,309
It was interesting because the argument boiled down

104
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,929
to Wire Guard is bad because it doesn't let

105
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,320
me configure everything the way exactly that I

106
00:04:38,329 --> 00:04:40,470
would like to and it is therefore better.

107
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,950
And I just, I literally read that and I was like,

108
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:47,670
I've set up like full mesh ips I VPN S and it was a nightmare

109
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:50,549
and I went and looked at the documentation for the modern stuff and guess what?

110
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,869
It's probably worse. No, it was, it's basically exactly the same

111
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,260
or you can actually do some really fancy stuff, but it involves like PK

112
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,309
I and DNS

113
00:04:59,489 --> 00:05:01,290
and auto discovery, which is

114
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,070
if you've ever set that kind of stuff up, man, it is

115
00:05:04,299 --> 00:05:10,019
-- crazy, hellacious, not fun.
-- That is exactly the response I would expect

116
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:14,790
-- from hacker news unquestionably. Like,
-- I love the fact that ips

117
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,250
still makes the distinction between authenticated

118
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,390
headers and encrypted something payloads.

119
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,420
So like it literally when they designed IPIC, they were like,

120
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,899
well, you know,

121
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:26,170
people might not want to actually encrypt their stuff,

122
00:05:26,179 --> 00:05:28,320
they might just want to like authentication header it

123
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:30,079
so that they know it wasn't altered in transit,

124
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:32,059
which OK, 30 years ago,

125
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,269
kind of made sense as a design

126
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:37,720
decision because encryption was computationally expensive,

127
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,910
like really expensive.

128
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:40,170
And you know,

129
00:05:40,179 --> 00:05:41,690
there's a lot of valid use cases where it's like

130
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,350
I need to know my data got there without getting,

131
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:44,489
you know, mangled.

132
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,459
I don't care about the safety of it.

133
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,649
So a great example of this always like say stock data, right, of,

134
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:51,040
you know, stock quote data, right?

135
00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:54,190
You, you really don't want that stuff being modified in transit.

136
00:05:54,239 --> 00:05:56,279
I would be shocked if there,

137
00:05:56,619 --> 00:05:58,660
if they're doing any sort of verification

138
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,600
because for those sorts of organizations,

139
00:06:00,609 --> 00:06:03,480
speed is going to be more important than correctness.

140
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:06,829
Well, now it is, yeah, with high frequency trading now it's, it's, yeah.

141
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:07,640
Ok, bad example.

142
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:10,160
But anyways, you know, there are valid cases where you have data that

143
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,760
can be public, but you definitely want to make sure it's correct. So weather data,

144
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,359
let's go with weather data, right? So anyways, it's

145
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,519
looking at wireguard, it's, it's

146
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:23,510
the thing I realized too is so IPIC comes from a time where, you know, bare metal,

147
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:23,790
right?

148
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:25,309
We barely had virtual machines.

149
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:29,070
Not only that, I think it's really important to remember that I

150
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:33,010
PEC is your typical protocol development committee where

151
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:35,709
there were probably no less than 50 people

152
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,070
involved in the creation of this and everyone had to bike shed it a little bit.

153
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:40,869
And so that's what,

154
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,250
yeah, I'm just seeing how many RFC S are there for this.

155
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,149
There's a couple.

156
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,010
Yeah, when there's more than one RFC then, you know, it's complicated.

157
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:50,940
There are

158
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,609
a lot of RFC S for this.

159
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,369
I would be shocked if there's less than 20

160
00:06:55,649 --> 00:07:02,970
-- let's see.
-- 2468, 1012, 1416, 1822. 46

161
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:09,579
32. 468, 40. I think I skipped a few back in 4042.

162
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,290
That's

163
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:12,489
the standards. There's 42 on the standards.

164
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:20,220
One on the experimental 2468, 1012, 14, on the informational one on best practices

165
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:24,339
and then two for about a dozen obsolete ones. Good God.

166
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,089
So OK, it's basically impossible to implement correctly,

167
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:30,130
right? Because just to, to, to actually, I dare

168
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,709
OK, listener challenge

169
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,779
anybody

170
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,880
that can go and read all of those RFC S.

171
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,660
You don't have to read the obsolete historical ones. But you can, if you want to,

172
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:41,299
if you read all of those RFC S and write like a

173
00:07:41,309 --> 00:07:44,140
one sentence summary of each RFC and send it to us.

174
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:45,760
Good for you.

175
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:49,170
No, don't send those to Kurt. I'm not reading them.

176
00:07:49,739 --> 00:07:55,489
I mean, this is very typical, I think of old I ETF engineering

177
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:56,510
where

178
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:00,809
it just so many of these protocols are so complicated.

179
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:05,790
I mean, my favorite example actually is TLS 1.2 versus TLS, 1.3 where in TLS,

180
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:08,149
1.3 they just got out the poop sh

181
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,589
and they threw out almost all of it because they

182
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,309
were like this is madness and it doesn't even work.

183
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,309
-- And I'm shocked they did
-- that. That was a great example too.

184
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,179
People are talking about, you know,

185
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:17,579
ips

186
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,220
has backwards compatibility and wire guard doesn't really make that a priority.

187
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,130
And I'm like, thank

188
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,709
God

189
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:29,279
backwards compatibility is always fraught with bugs and problems.

190
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:33,359
Throw away backwards compatibility. It is a terrible idea

191
00:08:33,489 --> 00:08:36,750
and it's a tough one though because for example, with iot and smartphones,

192
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,219
there's a lot of people with cheap phones out there that for example,

193
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:41,080
will never do TLS 1.2 and higher.

194
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,030
And I don't want to punish them for not being able to

195
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,309
like or wanting to buy a new smartphone just to have,

196
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,760
you know, TLS 1.2 or 1.3.

197
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:47,559
But at the same time,

198
00:08:47,859 --> 00:08:50,080
at some point that stuff starts to do more damage

199
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,599
than it's worth. I think, I suspect

200
00:08:52,849 --> 00:08:59,010
I agree. But I also would be willing to say in an environment with something like IPSA

201
00:08:59,489 --> 00:09:03,500
backwards compatibility, you have control over that.

202
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,630
You're not talking about randos connecting into your environment,

203
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,989
you have control over what's going on.

204
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,299
Well,

205
00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:11,270
unless you're talking about oftentimes it's used

206
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,729
to connect with partners and stuff.

207
00:09:12,739 --> 00:09:13,320
And I've heard, you know,

208
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:16,440
the horror stories where the two partners both have a 10 dot Star network and then

209
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:19,960
-- a gigantic argument about over who has to renumber.
-- Ok.

210
00:09:19,969 --> 00:09:21,539
I mean, and you can make that argument,

211
00:09:21,549 --> 00:09:24,000
but you could still even say I'm not partnering with you.

212
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,599
Unless you run a modern version of

213
00:09:25,859 --> 00:09:25,900
IEC,

214
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:30,190
you can't run the one you found in 1985 on that router in the closet.

215
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:31,229
Well, and that was the other thing too,

216
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:33,859
as simple as wireguard is to set up and there's

217
00:09:33,869 --> 00:09:37,460
packages and more modern operating systems on the Raspberry Pi,

218
00:09:37,469 --> 00:09:40,700
there are some sort of VPN specific distributions that have it,

219
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,359
but on the default Ras Bian

220
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:42,799
and

221
00:09:42,903 --> 00:09:46,533
don't mean default globally, but like kind of the default most people grab is rasp,

222
00:09:46,732 --> 00:09:48,002
right? I know it's one I grab.

223
00:09:48,013 --> 00:09:49,362
Yeah, I would, I would say that, yeah,

224
00:09:49,372 --> 00:09:52,942
you've got to compile this thing from source and just the get checkout alone

225
00:09:52,953 --> 00:09:56,052
on that Raspberry Pi for to rebuild it and do all the deltas took,

226
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,322
you know, the better part of an hour,

227
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:01,052
I will admit I've not tried making it work on a Raspberry Pi.

228
00:10:01,062 --> 00:10:03,982
We should probably clarify. I think we've talked about Wire

229
00:10:04,143 --> 00:10:05,643
Gard in the past, but I mean,

230
00:10:05,653 --> 00:10:09,052
kind of the nickel tour here is obviously anyone listening.

231
00:10:09,145 --> 00:10:11,325
We'll assume, you know what a VPN is if you don't,

232
00:10:11,335 --> 00:10:13,315
I don't even know how you found this podcast.

233
00:10:13,325 --> 00:10:13,685
But

234
00:10:13,935 --> 00:10:16,575
basically the old VPN S

235
00:10:16,736 --> 00:10:20,166
will say the, the VPN S from the older public, they are

236
00:10:20,306 --> 00:10:23,606
stodgy and complicated and they do everything

237
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,685
because they were developed by committees.

238
00:10:25,695 --> 00:10:28,226
Well, they were developed as frameworks, they weren't a product.

239
00:10:28,236 --> 00:10:31,445
It was like, well, we want a framework that can support every possible use case.

240
00:10:31,455 --> 00:10:34,046
-- Yeah, that's fair.
-- And so we'll give you all the options, right.

241
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:35,185
And then someone built it

242
00:10:35,388 --> 00:10:38,698
-- and they almost always support all the options.
-- Well, and here's the best part.

243
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:39,708
This is what I love about ips.

244
00:10:39,979 --> 00:10:41,809
Trick question. Which one do you install on? Linux?

245
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:45,028
-- I don't install any of them because I hate
-- it. Right.

246
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:49,689
Is it strong Swan or Libra Swan or? I think there's a third one I forgot.

247
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:56,208
So the times I've used them, the person I'm connecting to, had it set up and said,

248
00:10:56,299 --> 00:10:57,869
here's how you make it work.

249
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:01,448
And they gave me all of the configuration files and I installed which

250
00:11:01,822 --> 00:11:03,492
particular demon

251
00:11:03,682 --> 00:11:05,052
that they told me to

252
00:11:05,262 --> 00:11:07,731
-- because,
-- oh, here it is open Swans the third option.

253
00:11:07,742 --> 00:11:08,231
Sure.

254
00:11:08,242 --> 00:11:10,252
I don't even remember anymore. Thank goodness.

255
00:11:10,262 --> 00:11:13,831
Whatever VPN S are the same deal where there's a million of them.

256
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:14,961
They all work a little different.

257
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:18,572
I do remember a long time ago connecting to there was a Cisco VPN.

258
00:11:18,581 --> 00:11:21,651
I used that when you were on Linux every eight hours.

259
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:26,132
It needed to be re keyed but the client on Linux couldn't Rekey. So it just like puked.

260
00:11:26,142 --> 00:11:26,851
-- It was
-- great.

261
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:27,762
I remember having

262
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:31,104
VPN just bounce up and down every six hours or whatever to do with stuff like that.

263
00:11:31,114 --> 00:11:32,625
Yeah. Yeah, they were terrible.

264
00:11:32,635 --> 00:11:36,804
Anyway, anyway, so Wireguard is kind of the new kid on the block.

265
00:11:36,815 --> 00:11:37,994
I don't even know who built it,

266
00:11:38,005 --> 00:11:43,994
but it's easy and fast and it lacks a lot of configuration options.

267
00:11:44,025 --> 00:11:46,484
It works natively in a container with

268
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:46,844
IPs.

269
00:11:46,854 --> 00:11:47,895
You have, well,

270
00:11:47,905 --> 00:11:50,085
rather I shouldn't say that it works natively in

271
00:11:50,094 --> 00:11:51,825
a container if you give it the cap admin,

272
00:11:51,835 --> 00:11:54,054
the network admin capability,

273
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,070
which is not the most fun thing to do in the world, but it works.

274
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,020
I'm confident you could make

275
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:00,270
IPs

276
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,549
work in a container.

277
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:03,590
If you just tried hard enough,

278
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:05,710
you need a kernel module that is actually

279
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:07,950
officially people say like you shouldn't use this.

280
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,780
-- But if you want it to work here you go.
-- Maybe, I mean, you can Wire Shark

281
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:15,729
kernel module now. It was just accepted into the Linux kernel a couple of months ago.

282
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:16,809
-- You
-- mean
-- wireguard? But yeah,

283
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:20,270
I'm going to say Wire shark a lot. I mean wire guard.

284
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:23,500
No, you can definitely get IPIC working in a container, but it's,

285
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,849
it's a nontrivial amount of work.

286
00:12:24,859 --> 00:12:29,369
Whereas Wireguard works a lot more easily and natively in a container,

287
00:12:29,739 --> 00:12:31,400
which kind of got me thinking, I mean,

288
00:12:31,409 --> 00:12:35,840
part of me is I'm kind of over the whole VPN thing because to put it bluntly,

289
00:12:35,849 --> 00:12:38,840
I run most of my applications server stuff

290
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:44,239
on other people's stuff and I'm connecting to just totally strange random people.

291
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:44,679
So,

292
00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:46,140
you know, cloud flare is a great example, right?

293
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,380
They're my content delivery network.

294
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,739
Like I'm not going to set up an I PSY or a

295
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,640
VPN tunnel from my server to them to encrypt my web traffic.

296
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:56,539
-- I'm just going to use http
-- S you might not. But now don't you have a VP

297
00:12:56,736 --> 00:12:58,846
service you use for

298
00:12:59,056 --> 00:13:01,745
-- downloading things
-- for torrenting.

299
00:13:01,755 --> 00:13:06,966
-- Yeah, because only, I don't have a better option.
-- I also have one of those for things.

300
00:13:06,976 --> 00:13:10,695
And another example is I don't use Wireguard.

301
00:13:10,705 --> 00:13:13,546
Actually I keep meaning to do it at home, but I'm still too lazy.

302
00:13:13,556 --> 00:13:16,846
Is I ssh into my home computer.

303
00:13:16,856 --> 00:13:20,325
I've got a file server in the basement and I can ssh from the outside world.

304
00:13:20,335 --> 00:13:23,385
-- Well, that's
-- what I'm saying is at the I'm saying, basically that where I,

305
00:13:23,432 --> 00:13:24,442
I want this stuff to live is at the

306
00:13:24,452 --> 00:13:27,531
application level so that my application can conclusively say.

307
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:31,971
Yeah. No, we're cool. I'm safe. I'm using HTTP S or SSH or whatever. Not. Well,

308
00:13:32,221 --> 00:13:36,372
-- I'm going over the network and hopefully my underlying host is doing a VPN
-- sort of, I,

309
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:39,252
I don't care enough to want that feature.

310
00:13:39,262 --> 00:13:40,981
I rarely use VPN S.

311
00:13:40,992 --> 00:13:42,731
And so funny enough, in fact,

312
00:13:42,742 --> 00:13:46,791
there are some computers at work that I can only access through a VPN.

313
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:50,211
So I just don't access them. Like that's my solution.

314
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:51,210
Yeah,

315
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:52,820
everyone's like, oh, just connect to this machine.

316
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:53,780
I'm like, I don't have access to it.

317
00:13:53,789 --> 00:13:56,780
Like, oh, I'll set you up like, no, you don't understand. I don't want access to it.

318
00:13:56,789 --> 00:13:58,719
-- Like, it's not
-- correct me if I'm wrong,

319
00:13:58,729 --> 00:14:01,869
but there is no facility or concept in UNIX of

320
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,909
a program being able to ask the underlying operating system,

321
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:08,309
you know, or being able to specify to the underlying operating system.

322
00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:10,049
This traffic must be encrypted.

323
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,299
I mean, not that I'm aware of

324
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:17,969
-- and I don't think anyone, I mean, that's kind of why TLS even exists.
-- Well, exactly.

325
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:19,739
I need to know the application level what's going on.

326
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,200
I need to be able to say with certainty

327
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:25,219
this web request was encrypted or, you know this uh for upgrade.

328
00:14:25,229 --> 00:14:28,630
Now, I do a data backup and I transfer the data backup from server A to backup

329
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,630
B

330
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:31,750
Well, yeah. Was it encrypted in transit?

331
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,960
I need to be able to say yes, with 100% certainty.

332
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,469
Right.

333
00:14:37,979 --> 00:14:39,099
Anyway,

334
00:14:39,229 --> 00:14:39,729
I also, I,

335
00:14:39,739 --> 00:14:41,690
I think maybe we're in the weeds a little bit because I

336
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:46,700
know we wanted to discuss this at a higher level and talk about

337
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,650
people complaining about lack of features or new things or

338
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,179
I think especially in the world of Linux and UNIX,

339
00:14:55,190 --> 00:15:00,159
you get a lot of the change is bad crowd and wireguard is

340
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,900
very different and very new.

341
00:15:03,109 --> 00:15:06,179
Well, I'm also thinking that a lot of it is, is not just change is bad, but

342
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,880
I want to do things my way.

343
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:13,219
I don't want to do them this more normal standardized workflow way.

344
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:16,760
And I see this a lot in cloud computing, right, where I go to a cloud vendor.

345
00:15:17,109 --> 00:15:21,960
So I'll just a generic email list server type people, for example, right?

346
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:23,599
And a lot of them are like, you know,

347
00:15:23,609 --> 00:15:26,880
we will put mandatory unsubscribed footers in your email.

348
00:15:27,185 --> 00:15:29,625
So, you know, somebody clicks on that, they come to our site,

349
00:15:29,635 --> 00:15:31,176
they can unsubscribe from your list,

350
00:15:31,356 --> 00:15:34,216
they can leave a reason, you know, saying it's abuse or it's spam or whatever,

351
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:38,096
meaning thus, if you are on our service and you become abusive, we can boot you.

352
00:15:38,306 --> 00:15:40,375
And you know, I know a lot of people don't like that because they're like, no,

353
00:15:40,385 --> 00:15:41,395
we want to handle the anti,

354
00:15:41,705 --> 00:15:45,335
you know, the unsubscribe and all that. And I'm like, no, you let the vendor do it

355
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:49,161
and you behave and I, and I, I think that's better long term for everybody, you know,

356
00:15:49,171 --> 00:15:50,952
but a lot of these vendors, you know,

357
00:15:50,961 --> 00:15:52,911
want to have that more perceived control

358
00:15:52,921 --> 00:15:54,671
over everything that's going on and not give

359
00:15:54,682 --> 00:15:59,512
up any control or not change their workflow to be a more normal standard workflow.

360
00:15:59,521 --> 00:16:02,262
Right? I mean, I understand what you're saying and

361
00:16:02,401 --> 00:16:07,432
I think I would have agreed with that attitude a couple of years ago even.

362
00:16:07,882 --> 00:16:12,151
And I think the world of open source especially is built upon

363
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,650
this kind of

364
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:15,340
concept of choice.

365
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:15,570
I

366
00:16:15,729 --> 00:16:17,570
did it my way, right?

367
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:22,380
But I feel like especially in the world of security that the

368
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:27,340
observations of the world today are showing us that too much choice

369
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:32,539
is bad because too much choice can't be secured. And I will perpetually pick

370
00:16:32,645 --> 00:16:34,945
on TLS 1.2 here where TLS,

371
00:16:34,955 --> 00:16:39,346
1.2 supports every cipher ever created by humans it feels

372
00:16:39,356 --> 00:16:42,276
like and like half of them are now insecure.

373
00:16:42,286 --> 00:16:45,986
It's like, so just freaking take them out. I mean, what's up with this?

374
00:16:45,995 --> 00:16:52,736
It's very frustrating and very difficult. And I think VPN S are a great example of

375
00:16:52,851 --> 00:16:57,192
these VPN S do everything and when you do everything,

376
00:16:57,202 --> 00:16:59,351
you're not going to get it all right

377
00:16:59,481 --> 00:17:01,591
-- and you don't get it all right.
-- Oh, yeah.

378
00:17:01,601 --> 00:17:05,082
I was looking at some of the options and I didn't recognize them.

379
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:07,661
I'm like, I would have to look up what this does do. I do.

380
00:17:07,671 --> 00:17:10,790
I need to set this option is the default safe. Like I have no

381
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:12,952
-- idea.
-- I agree.

382
00:17:13,338 --> 00:17:18,358
I think it's very complicated and it's unnecessarily complicated in many cases.

383
00:17:18,368 --> 00:17:21,989
But again, we're back to the protocol by committee and I mean,

384
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,548
I PV six is another example.

385
00:17:23,558 --> 00:17:29,729
I, I PV six does an insane number of things because it had a million people work on it.

386
00:17:29,739 --> 00:17:30,718
And so now you probably

387
00:17:30,829 --> 00:17:33,250
50 RFC s and nobody knows how it works.

388
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:33,790
Yeah, I looked,

389
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,209
I remember looking at the I PV six roaming stuff and trying to

390
00:17:36,219 --> 00:17:39,410
understand it and just kind of gave up after 20 or 30 pages

391
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,959
-- and
-- no one's going to use it.

392
00:17:40,969 --> 00:17:41,229
I mean,

393
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:44,339
I PV four even has some Bizarro extensions like that and

394
00:17:44,349 --> 00:17:47,329
nobody uses any of them because they just don't work.

395
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:48,130
I mean, it,

396
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,880
I love this about computers where you have these

397
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:55,939
protocols and you have these features where

398
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,380
they can do amazing and incredible things,

399
00:17:58,489 --> 00:18:02,420
but in many cases, it's so complicated, nobody can figure them out.

400
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:06,780
So just, nobody uses them. And at that point, why is this even a thing?

401
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,270
The whole thing sort of reminds me of, you know,

402
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,400
where cars have gone in the last 50 years from being,

403
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,900
you get this collection of parts that sometimes works together but you got

404
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,020
to tune it a lot or pay somebody to tune it to,

405
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,599
you know, I take my car and

406
00:18:17,699 --> 00:18:20,040
I think I'm supposed to take it in twice a year for an oil change.

407
00:18:20,219 --> 00:18:22,260
That's pretty much the extent of my maintenance. Oh.

408
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,989
And I get the tires swapped in, you know,

409
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,339
fall and spring for my winter and summer tires and that's it.

410
00:18:27,349 --> 00:18:30,280
Like, I don't really make a lot of choices about my car other than, you know,

411
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,449
the radio presets

412
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,719
you could make the argument.

413
00:18:32,729 --> 00:18:36,880
Cars are more complicated than ever before, which is obviously not wrong.

414
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:39,989
Well, but it's hidden from me in the sense of when something does break.

415
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,040
I take it to a mechanic.

416
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:45,000
He plugs in one of those OD, whatever ODBC two or whatever readers and,

417
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:48,689
and tells me, you know, how painful it's going to be and then I see him

418
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,510
-- and come back like a day later. It,
-- it is true.

419
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:54,199
That is how it works. I see what you're saying though.

420
00:18:54,219 --> 00:18:55,510
And that's where it's headed with cloud. Right.

421
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,869
Like we have these vendors where it's like, either you,

422
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,430
they can fix it or they can't fix it for us.

423
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:01,349
And, well, we had this with, you know, our,

424
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,579
when we moved from

425
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,770
Zencastr. Wow, that's Zencastr had problems. Right. And what was our option?

426
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:11,060
Well, we can either live with those problems or find a new provider.

427
00:19:11,069 --> 00:19:13,229
No, we couldn't live with them because it didn't work.

428
00:19:13,699 --> 00:19:16,329
It got so bad but it just kept tipping over, you know.

429
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,819
Yeah, I remember we'd spend 23 hours trying to record and

430
00:19:19,189 --> 00:19:20,560
it just didn't work at all.

431
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:24,400
So, I mean, I get why people kind of hate that world, you know?

432
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:28,339
No, you know, this thing contains no user serviceable parts. But at the same time,

433
00:19:28,449 --> 00:19:30,780
you know, if you want like a really flat smartphone,

434
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,500
yeah, we're gonna have to glue it together.

435
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:36,170
I'm, I'm cool with the big fat thick one, but I,

436
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:42,000
I hear you and I'm ok with restricting choice to a certain degree.

437
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:44,569
And I feel like this is a situation

438
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:47,439
where if you're unhappy with the way Wireguard works

439
00:19:47,449 --> 00:19:51,119
and you think it needs some fixes or you think it needs to do something else.

440
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,926
Patch is welcome. I mean, there's literally nothing stopping you from.

441
00:19:54,936 --> 00:19:58,026
Well, there is because most people who complain are just bags of gas.

442
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,875
But like there's no reason you can't go do your own thing.

443
00:20:00,885 --> 00:20:03,105
Well, you can fork it because my understanding is that Jason,

444
00:20:03,115 --> 00:20:06,706
a Donenfeld who created wireguard is pretty strict on his

445
00:20:06,715 --> 00:20:08,156
stance of what it will and will not do.

446
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,505
And I respect that, you know, it kind of reminds me of, you know,

447
00:20:10,515 --> 00:20:12,365
like Python or Pearl where you have this, you know,

448
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:15,355
benevolent dictator for life who decides, you know,

449
00:20:15,491 --> 00:20:18,011
this is where this is headed and, you know, we're going to stick to it.

450
00:20:18,021 --> 00:20:21,031
Didn't, I think Guido gave up Python?

451
00:20:21,171 --> 00:20:22,401
-- Yes,
-- he, well and yeah,

452
00:20:22,411 --> 00:20:26,712
he's since handed it over to a foundation or a committee or I don't know,

453
00:20:26,722 --> 00:20:27,442
whatever I have.

454
00:20:27,452 --> 00:20:28,751
I have no idea who owns it now.

455
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,631
-- But
-- yeah, but at that point too, you know,

456
00:20:30,641 --> 00:20:34,031
the Python culture is pretty firm like they,

457
00:20:34,261 --> 00:20:36,342
-- they have culture and
-- that's fair.

458
00:20:36,709 --> 00:20:41,219
-- I don't even know. Is pearl, does pearl still exist? I haven't used pearl.
-- Yep.

459
00:20:41,229 --> 00:20:43,189
They changed the name for Pearl Six.

460
00:20:43,449 --> 00:20:43,689
Raku.

461
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:46,270
-- What is
-- it? Raku? Raku.

462
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,589
I've never even heard of that.

463
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,050
Raku is a member of the Pearl family of programming languages,

464
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,069
formerly known as Pearl Six.

465
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:55,469
It was renamed in October 2019. It introduces elements of blah, blah, blah.

466
00:20:55,479 --> 00:20:56,520
It's Pearl Six.

467
00:20:56,604 --> 00:21:00,704
-- As I understand it is this, you know,
-- my favorite part of Pearl Lois was,

468
00:21:00,714 --> 00:21:02,165
was Larry Wall.

469
00:21:02,234 --> 00:21:03,025
Yeah, exactly.

470
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:08,824
Larry Wall is one of the greatest and most entertaining speakers I have ever heard.

471
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:12,584
-- He's awesome.
-- He had style and taste so well. There you go, folks.

472
00:21:12,594 --> 00:21:16,185
Maybe we should stick to products that are run by people with style and taste.

473
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,099
Well, no, really.

474
00:21:18,329 --> 00:21:21,810
Actually, Larry had some interesting comments and this,

475
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:25,170
this is kind of on par with this discussion is.

476
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:25,729
So

477
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,939
I I forget exactly what the comment is.

478
00:21:27,949 --> 00:21:31,160
But he basically said when someone asked about making pearl easier because this

479
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:35,380
is back during like the pearl versus Python versus Ruby fight where I thought

480
00:21:35,489 --> 00:21:38,199
Ruby and Python were all about. Oh, let's make it easy.

481
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:41,800
And Pearl is Pearl and Larry Wall basically said something about, you know,

482
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,329
you can make this easier.

483
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:47,469
But it's kind of like if you make writing easier just because everyone can write,

484
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:50,270
doesn't mean I want to read the novels they create, right?

485
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,229
I want to read novels from good authors, not from anyone who can write.

486
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:58,989
-- And like he's not wrong
-- php is the poster child of this argument, right?

487
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,349
Oh my God

488
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:01,619
must be

489
00:22:01,849 --> 00:22:02,109
real.

490
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,969
And I'm not saying it's a bad thing.

491
00:22:03,979 --> 00:22:06,729
Like look at what, you know, wordpress and Facebook have created with PHP.

492
00:22:06,739 --> 00:22:10,489
It can be awesome, but you look at the majority of PHP code and it's just,

493
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,280
it's terrible.

494
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:15,670
Yes, we can keep taking this towards the the authors

495
00:22:15,819 --> 00:22:17,689
and writing concept is

496
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,479
if you think back, you know, probably two or 300 years,

497
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:25,920
the number of people who were actually literate was fairly low in many places.

498
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,930
And so if you could write,

499
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,400
you were probably a good author for a variety of reasons.

500
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,739
-- Well,
-- by definition,

501
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,859
you were a good author because there was such a small pool of authors.

502
00:22:35,869 --> 00:22:36,140
Yeah,

503
00:22:36,949 --> 00:22:40,469
-- that's true. That is true. It's
-- like music. It's, it's funny.

504
00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:44,020
I listen to music and some of the older music that I used to think was good as a kid.

505
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:47,290
Now I listen to it and I'm like, or even better example, children's cartoons. Ok.

506
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,300
There's 10,

507
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:49,020
my goodness.

508
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:49,160
I

509
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,150
looking at older children's cartoons now I'm like,

510
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,979
this is just got off like this is just objectively bad,

511
00:22:55,989 --> 00:22:58,319
poor quality Hannah Barbera animation with.

512
00:22:58,442 --> 00:23:01,093
Yes, exactly. I, I understand.

513
00:23:01,103 --> 00:23:05,822
I got Disney Plus and Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers are on Disney Plus.

514
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:07,733
And I thought, oh, I watched this as a kid.

515
00:23:07,743 --> 00:23:09,703
We need to watch this and I told my kids I'm like, hey,

516
00:23:09,713 --> 00:23:11,983
let's watch this and the intro starts and I'm like,

517
00:23:11,993 --> 00:23:15,772
I don't remember the intro being this bad and then the cartoon and literally I made it

518
00:23:15,782 --> 00:23:19,743
about four minutes in and I had to turn it off because it was so bad.

519
00:23:20,115 --> 00:23:21,566
Took my, the, the local,

520
00:23:21,576 --> 00:23:23,536
one of the local cinemas does like free

521
00:23:23,546 --> 00:23:26,235
children's movies every Saturday with cereal or whatever.

522
00:23:26,245 --> 00:23:29,125
And we went to the Muppets movie and my kids wanted to

523
00:23:29,135 --> 00:23:31,105
leave and so did I after about five or 10 minutes,

524
00:23:31,115 --> 00:23:33,296
no, the Muppets movie is awesome.

525
00:23:33,306 --> 00:23:35,416
-- You take that back?
-- It's terrible.

526
00:23:35,536 --> 00:23:39,446
-- No, no, I watched that one. A couple of months ago and it, it holds up. I
-- love it.

527
00:23:39,505 --> 00:23:41,635
I think we're gonna have to agree to disagree.

528
00:23:42,426 --> 00:23:44,005
No. No, you are wrong

529
00:23:44,446 --> 00:23:45,176
anyway.

530
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:45,979
Yeah,

531
00:23:46,109 --> 00:23:48,760
that's fair. But, no, I, I agree with you 100%.

532
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:53,130
It's, it's always funny how that, that changes. But anyway, the point being

533
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:56,920
in kind of the world of development, obviously, like anyone,

534
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:00,400
anyone can write code now, but I don't want anyone to write code.

535
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:02,369
Well, not just they can write code, they can publish it,

536
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,920
they can get it into the ecosystem.

537
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:08,160
Like there is no barrier of entry to get stuff into like Ruby gms.org or,

538
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:09,400
or N PM or whatever.

539
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:13,760
No, no, not at all. Yeah, but I would then also that if you looked at like the

540
00:24:13,925 --> 00:24:14,994
PM ecosystem,

541
00:24:15,005 --> 00:24:19,625
it's probably very long tail where there's a couple 100 packages that are used

542
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:24,435
-- by a lot of projects and then most of them probably have one or two
-- uses. Y

543
00:24:24,765 --> 00:24:28,344
oh yeah. Well, I mean that, that applies to everything that's ever been created.

544
00:24:28,354 --> 00:24:31,474
-- Basically.
-- No, I, I agree. I agree. So anyway, anyway,

545
00:24:31,655 --> 00:24:35,385
the concept of, I guess the paradox of choice, right?

546
00:24:35,395 --> 00:24:38,494
Where I feel like we are learning enough about

547
00:24:38,505 --> 00:24:41,824
security these days where choice is bad choice.

548
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:42,719
This is not a feature.

549
00:24:42,729 --> 00:24:44,439
-- And I think we used to think it was a
-- feature

550
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:47,170
choice is very hard and to make a good choice,

551
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:50,380
you need to have a lot of information and I would consider

552
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:54,410
myself like an above average computer user slash computer security person.

553
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:57,930
But if you asked me to actually, for example, go in depth on I

554
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,449
pec options. My answer would be like, I'm not an expert on that. I will mess it up.

555
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,890
There's probably six people on the planet

556
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:06,689
who could do that.

557
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,609
I agree with you 100%.

558
00:25:09,895 --> 00:25:10,795
And I mean,

559
00:25:10,805 --> 00:25:14,555
this is one of the challenges with a lot of these security technologies and it's not,

560
00:25:14,564 --> 00:25:15,444
I mean, not even just IP

561
00:25:15,675 --> 00:25:15,915
A right.

562
00:25:15,925 --> 00:25:20,364
You can pick on countless technologies, everything from antivirus to firewalls,

563
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:21,464
to encryption,

564
00:25:21,594 --> 00:25:22,425
to, you know,

565
00:25:22,435 --> 00:25:27,094
TLS to VPN S where we've created these monsters that

566
00:25:27,104 --> 00:25:29,275
just have so many options and so much choice,

567
00:25:29,285 --> 00:25:32,594
you have everything from the development of it is nearly impossible to get.

568
00:25:32,604 --> 00:25:36,444
Right. So no one does. The deployment of it is nearly impossible to get. Right.

569
00:25:36,454 --> 00:25:39,729
So no one does and the usage of it, it's nearly impossible to get. Right.

570
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:44,500
So no one does. And it's like if you were trying to set someone up for failure,

571
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:48,780
this is how you do it where there's just insane complexity from top to bottom.

572
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,819
That's terrible. Right.

573
00:25:49,829 --> 00:25:52,979
Whereas then you look at something like wire guard and they've taken away.

574
00:25:52,989 --> 00:25:53,959
I mean, don't get me wrong.

575
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:58,260
It's still not like super simple to set up like I could not teach my mom to do it,

576
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:00,900
but it's pretty freaking easy compared to most things.

577
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,920
Well, there's, I mean, there's just way less things,

578
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,270
options to type in and get wrong and fat finger.

579
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:05,780
Yeah. Right.

580
00:26:06,224 --> 00:26:06,734
And I just,

581
00:26:06,744 --> 00:26:09,474
I love the fact that it doesn't really play that well with modern technology,

582
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,535
like containers.

583
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:13,015
-- You mean, the old stuff doesn't play well?
-- Yeah.

584
00:26:13,025 --> 00:26:14,125
The IPs doesn't, you know,

585
00:26:14,135 --> 00:26:15,724
you have to install a kernel module and do

586
00:26:15,734 --> 00:26:17,964
some other shenanigans to get it working and behaving.

587
00:26:17,974 --> 00:26:20,084
It was built in a different time.

588
00:26:20,094 --> 00:26:20,564
I mean,

589
00:26:20,574 --> 00:26:23,844
Wireguard was built in the world of containers and it

590
00:26:23,854 --> 00:26:26,844
wouldn't shock me if it was developed literally in containers,

591
00:26:26,854 --> 00:26:27,084
right?

592
00:26:27,094 --> 00:26:28,954
But there's lots of things that work fine in containers

593
00:26:28,964 --> 00:26:31,854
or have been easily modified to work well in containers.

594
00:26:31,864 --> 00:26:34,520
Yeah, but they probably don't have 50 plus RFC S.

595
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:37,709
Yeah, I guess they've sort of painted themselves into a corner there.

596
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:38,109
Yeah.

597
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:39,829
And like, look that's, I mean,

598
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:42,670
part of the beauty of RFC S and the downfall of RFC

599
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,430
S is the fact that it's very difficult to make changes.

600
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:47,670
And in certain things like IBV four,

601
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:49,969
I don't want people making random I PV four change.

602
00:26:49,979 --> 00:26:55,089
Like, I mean, imagine the Microsoft of the late nineties if they were like, oh,

603
00:26:55,099 --> 00:26:57,040
I think I PV four should work like this.

604
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:00,699
-- I remember that actually because I, I
-- did, they do that

605
00:27:00,709 --> 00:27:01,130
well. No, no, no.

606
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:01,739
Microsoft didn't.

607
00:27:01,834 --> 00:27:08,104
I remember like paying IBM for the OS two TCP/IP add on pack and like TCP/IP stacks.

608
00:27:08,114 --> 00:27:10,935
Were not always completely compatible with each other, you know,

609
00:27:10,944 --> 00:27:15,214
-- or there were glitchy things like, no,
-- I don't remember any that didn't work

610
00:27:15,224 --> 00:27:15,494
well.

611
00:27:15,505 --> 00:27:17,775
They would work together. But you'd get like, you know, just

612
00:27:18,015 --> 00:27:20,925
things where like packet sizes, things like that, you know,

613
00:27:20,935 --> 00:27:22,655
where just things would go wonky or,

614
00:27:22,765 --> 00:27:22,974
you know,

615
00:27:22,984 --> 00:27:26,994
this thing with this router and this packet size just can't work things like that.

616
00:27:27,005 --> 00:27:29,694
I mean, that, that's fair. That's fair. But it,

617
00:27:30,089 --> 00:27:32,589
thank goodness we fix most of those problems.

618
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,239
Choice and RFC si, I don't even know what to say.

619
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:43,270
I feel like this is one of those situations where less choice is better,

620
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,280
especially in the world of security.

621
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,609
I would rather see two products

622
00:27:47,719 --> 00:27:52,150
that each do their own specific thing than one product that tries to do both.

623
00:27:52,369 --> 00:27:53,270
Well, or in the case of

624
00:27:53,469 --> 00:27:56,229
IPIC one product that literally tries to do everything.

625
00:27:59,020 --> 00:27:59,290
Yeah.

626
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:02,060
And there's no way to really secure it.

627
00:28:02,069 --> 00:28:04,310
I mean, you might think it's secure but I guarantee there's,

628
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:06,760
there's skeletons in those closets and

629
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:11,260
part of it is people just haven't found them. And I mean, I feel like the number of IP

630
00:28:11,469 --> 00:28:12,329
S a security issues,

631
00:28:12,425 --> 00:28:15,165
I've seen it's drastically lower than it should be

632
00:28:15,175 --> 00:28:16,755
when you compare it to something like TLS,

633
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:20,094
which I think even TLS 1.2 is less complicated than IPSA.

634
00:28:20,354 --> 00:28:24,185
-- There have been a but there's a lot of research, but I
-- think there's 152

635
00:28:24,474 --> 00:28:27,655
ips flaws. And that's multiple vendors. Granted. But still,

636
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,380
I feel like it should be way higher than that though.

637
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,869
I mean, how many, what do you get when you search for TLS?

638
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,739
Oh, well, TLS, you're going to get a lot of stuff that uses TLS improperly.

639
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:42,050
-- Not so much TLS
-- itself. There have been a generous number of TLS flaws.

640
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:42,280
Oh, yeah.

641
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:45,060
I'm not saying there haven't been, I'm just saying with TLS, you also get

642
00:28:45,479 --> 00:28:48,199
all the applications that make use of TLS and for example,

643
00:28:48,209 --> 00:28:49,500
forget to do host name checks.

644
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,060
Well, you can't really blame

645
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:56,030
TLS for that as a protocol as an implementation. Like when was it open SSL?

646
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,640
And, and also Python didn't check the host names by default. That absolutely like

647
00:29:00,089 --> 00:29:01,930
-- everything worked well.
-- Great. Yeah,

648
00:29:02,939 --> 00:29:03,650
so

649
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:07,689
everything works so well. All right. Anyway, we should, we should end this one.

650
00:29:07,699 --> 00:29:10,530
I'll give you the last word. Kurt. What are your final thoughts?

651
00:29:12,469 --> 00:29:13,219
Yeah, that's it.

652
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:18,310
-- That's my final thought is a heartfelt sigh.
-- That sigh is a nice thought. I like that.

653
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:18,739
That,

654
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:23,489
that sums up all of security. Just a big long sigh. All right, cool. I'm calling it.

655
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,859
So, thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening. You can go to open

656
00:29:25,979 --> 00:29:29,050
social security podcast.com, hit up the show notes, you can use the Pound

657
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:29,199
and

658
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:31,579
Os S Podcast hashtag to send Kurt

659
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:36,160
hate mail about why you think VPN S are great and why your guards

660
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:39,630
And yeah, you can, I forget where you, where you were at. Pando

661
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:40,939
says podcast hashtag

662
00:29:41,349 --> 00:29:45,250
