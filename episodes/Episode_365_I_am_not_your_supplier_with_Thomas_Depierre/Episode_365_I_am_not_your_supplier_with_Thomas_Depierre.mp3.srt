Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,220
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:11,229 --> 00:00:12,109
Josh Pressers.

3
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,010
Today's the day, I'm excited.

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:18,729
We have Toma De Pierre, the author of, I am not a supplier on the show. Toma.

5
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:20,739
Welcome to the show. I can't wait.

6
00:00:21,299 --> 00:00:23,319
Hello, everyone. Thank you for having me.

7
00:00:23,329 --> 00:00:26,149
We have been waiting for quite some time to talk with you about this

8
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:29,319
and we have been talking, you know, on social media and all that stuff.

9
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:30,520
So it will be interesting.

10
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:31,299
-- Oh, it's going
-- to

11
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:32,150
be so good. All right.

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,119
So let's just,

13
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,209
I will let you explain what you wrote and we will go from

14
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,459
there because you lit the world on fire with your blog post.

15
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,930
I'm in, I, I don't know if I lit the world on fire, but like that was kind of the point,

16
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:45,470
right?

17
00:00:45,599 --> 00:00:47,419
I was getting pissed off.

18
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,560
Uh I've been getting pissed off about this whole discussion for quite some time.

19
00:00:50,569 --> 00:00:55,599
So the blog post I wrote is basically basically what I write here

20
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:56,450
is I,

21
00:00:56,459 --> 00:01:00,810
I wanted to talk about the whole discussion around the um software supply chain,

22
00:01:00,819 --> 00:01:01,110
right?

23
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:04,529
Which is a tool, especially if you are around the infosec world.

24
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:04,919
It's a,

25
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,169
it's a term you have probably heard a lot in the past few

26
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,879
months or even a couple of years for a lot of reasons.

27
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:11,449
And,

28
00:01:11,919 --> 00:01:15,330
and I have a lot of problem with it because,

29
00:01:15,349 --> 00:01:20,150
and so what I wrote in that is that I think that the term is fundamentally

30
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:24,620
problematic to use because for open source software, at least

31
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,059
because as open source maintainers and as people that, that use open source,

32
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:32,209
we are not in a supply relationship, right?

33
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,589
We are not in a supplier

34
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,819
um relationship where you are,

35
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,330
we are providing you something even that is kind of a problematic word.

36
00:01:40,339 --> 00:01:43,889
And so the whole discussion was around trying to explain

37
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:47,589
what the supply chain the software supply chain ID is because

38
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:49,690
I talk to people that may not have heard of the term

39
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,970
and then explain what a supply chain is usually

40
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,610
in the way we think of it

41
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,190
in manufacturing because I've spent some time manufacturing

42
00:01:57,559 --> 00:02:00,650
and explaining why I don't think it apply here and why

43
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,750
it is kind of a problem to use it that way.

44
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,089
And something we may talk later is that I think it's

45
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:09,389
even counterproductive and that's something we may want to talk about.

46
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,880
It's funny because I actually thought when I read that title immediately,

47
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:14,250
my brain went to the, you know,

48
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:14,740
Sinon

49
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,309
pipe like this is not a pipe just because

50
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:22,610
you produce software and freely give it away. That does not make you a supplier.

51
00:02:22,619 --> 00:02:24,600
Like in my mind, that supplier,

52
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,910
well, for there to even be a relationship, a relationship implies a two way street.

53
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,139
In my experience, the vast majority of open source programmers,

54
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,205
they have no idea who's using it software, let alone have ever spoken to them.

55
00:02:37,214 --> 00:02:39,365
And so, yeah, like you, I, I looked at this and I'm like, well, yeah,

56
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,195
this sort of seems self evident but,

57
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:42,505
well, I guess it's not.

58
00:02:42,664 --> 00:02:45,884
And I think there's another thing here, we, we, which we, we,

59
00:02:45,895 --> 00:02:49,565
we tend to forget because it's so fundamental and really talked about

60
00:02:49,934 --> 00:02:51,725
you were talking of the two way street.

61
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:56,929
It's not even a one way street because as the person that write the software,

62
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,250
I put it up.

63
00:02:58,529 --> 00:03:00,850
But I have no

64
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:05,679
by definition in every single free open source license, I

65
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,919
disclaim all liability,

66
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,320
right? The software is provided as is

67
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,759
I at no point.

68
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,449
Is there even a one way, I don't know who you are,

69
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:17,919
but you don't need to know anything about me.

70
00:03:17,929 --> 00:03:21,759
And I am explicitly getting rid of anything that could link this to me,

71
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,440
right?

72
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,410
So by making it 300

73
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,600
souls, I'm cutting this relationship.

74
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:30,300
I want to pick on you now because this is something you and I,

75
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:35,160
I think might have briefly argued about at Mastodon is it's easy to say

76
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:40,080
that you owe nothing and you will do nothing unless you feel like it.

77
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,229
But as you pointed out to me,

78
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:43,899
you need to sleep at night.

79
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,440
So if you have an open source project and it has,

80
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:48,940
let's say a critical vulnerability that, you know, is affecting,

81
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:52,490
say every Java application on earth, you're not going to just be like, screw it.

82
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,059
I'm out. You're going to do what needs to be done because you're a good person.

83
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:56,539
Yes.

84
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,529
But that's not based on the relationship that's based on me and my own

85
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:02,570
decision about how I do my life and why I did this thing,

86
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,020
right?

87
00:04:03,649 --> 00:04:06,070
Where? But that's also we have a problem, right?

88
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,789
That's where we have a fundamental discussion around the

89
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,750
way we govern and handle this kind of work because

90
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,500
I don't have to do it.

91
00:04:14,529 --> 00:04:17,548
But I think I, I will do it for all these things you talked about, right?

92
00:04:17,559 --> 00:04:20,769
I need to sleep at night and there is more discussion we can have on this because I have

93
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:23,119
a few ideas and things I think can make

94
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,440
sense to bring here to explain to our listeners.

95
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,869
But at the same time,

96
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,399
we cannot as a society expect me to do it.

97
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,260
Maybe it's perhaps part of the problem here

98
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:35,140
is the framing of the discussion because I'm thinking

99
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,799
essentially both sides want the same thing.

100
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,269
But the open source person does it for intrinsic motivation, self motivation.

101
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,649
And the external party is saying, no, you have this obligation,

102
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,440
you have this extrinsic motivation to do it.

103
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:54,089
And I think maybe this is part of the problem because fundamentally the majority of

104
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,529
people want the same thing which is like bug fixes and security updates and,

105
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,769
you know, releases.

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,529
But

107
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,269
it's one of those subtle things where, so basically what you're saying,

108
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,040
what I'm hearing is that you're doing it for intrinsic motivation

109
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:11,049
and that you don't give a, you do not care about the extrinsic motivation of like, oh,

110
00:05:11,299 --> 00:05:15,570
it's the right thing to do because it serves the world or blah, blah, blah.

111
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:17,040
Would, would that be correct?

112
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,059
No. Uh

113
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,209
I, I think there is a difference here

114
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,609
and I think because I think

115
00:05:23,049 --> 00:05:26,850
we cannot say that people don't do that because it helps the world, right?

116
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,170
An example I would bring here is I have high doubt

117
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:31,570
that the people that on

118
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,609
all the time zone database,

119
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:34,369
right?

120
00:05:34,619 --> 00:05:36,779
Which is basically two people doing it voluntarily.

121
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,529
And that's kind of an interesting discussion to have to do that

122
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:39,880
for fun.

123
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,369
I mean, they do it, I mean, it's complicated, we can get that

124
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,679
but I don't think they do it for fun, right?

125
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:48,890
I mean,

126
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:51,989
part of this is because they are interestingly they like this thing

127
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,200
and they like the whole complexity and expertise they have in this,

128
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:57,779
but they also do it because they know they have an impact and

129
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,049
that's something that is, I think

130
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:05,920
general for engineers, right? Is that a lot of engineers, I don't mean everyone.

131
00:06:05,929 --> 00:06:06,059
Right.

132
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:10,570
But other engineers do this because even in the very small part, we do the thing,

133
00:06:10,989 --> 00:06:13,309
right? Even if our job as engineers to work on

134
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,809
a coffee lid, right.

135
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,299
There are engineers that spend thousands of hours on engineering,

136
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:21,179
a better coffee lead.

137
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:24,910
We know that it's going to be useful and help people.

138
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,660
So I think that's not the inspiration.

139
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,790
I think you are. Right.

140
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:29,160
So,

141
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:33,269
in talking about the framing and I think the problem here is that

142
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,670
we frame it as an open source free and open source software problem.

143
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:39,220
And I think that's the wrong framing

144
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,920
because I think

145
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,279
yes, most of this case, we are caring a lot about for

146
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,799
security and all that stuff

147
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:47,929
are

148
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:48,779
free and

149
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:49,600
software

150
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:51,980
like not all of them but a lot of them.

151
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,480
But I think

152
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:56,890
the causality is not that we can the

153
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:59,040
security because there are performance or software,

154
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,170
they are free

155
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,209
software

156
00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:04,359
because they are digital infrastructure because they are

157
00:07:04,369 --> 00:07:06,709
the things that allow us to create things.

158
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,209
And so they end up everywhere

159
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,130
and

160
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:12,690
to enable them to be everywhere and have we, we can have a whole,

161
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,459
I have a whole idea explaining how we got that,

162
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,250
but

163
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,130
they are everywhere

164
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:19,880
and the fact they're everywhere

165
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,290
fools them to be free and open source.

166
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,309
Because if they were not,

167
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,359
we would have to manage so much commercial relationship

168
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,339
to just make a basic product

169
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,679
that we would not be able to create that product,

170
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,059
right?

171
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,309
And so we end up in the situation where all of

172
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,059
this as two governments also wind up with open source everywhere.

173
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,329
And then we have the discussion of how do we manage,

174
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:50,660
maintain and govern that body, that shared body of infrastructure.

175
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:56,299
And that's why I think the the that's kind of why I think the supplier relationship is

176
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,820
problematic is because

177
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:01,500
we can't get, we can't not have them,

178
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:02,510
right?

179
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:06,600
If you are a supply, if you supply crews, I worked for some time in car manufacturing.

180
00:08:06,609 --> 00:08:08,339
If you supply crews to a scout

181
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,250
manufacturer

182
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:11,100
and they don't like what you produce,

183
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:12,869
they can go to a competitor,

184
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,589
they can change the through. It's relatively standard on

185
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:15,799
all

186
00:08:16,179 --> 00:08:16,279
the

187
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:17,929
of software is that there is not really

188
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,420
any competitors for some of these bad infrastructure.

189
00:08:20,429 --> 00:08:21,899
It's just the same everywhere

190
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:25,220
and there's a lot of reasons why, right. There's not that much variants

191
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,970
and there are a lot of good reasons why, mostly because it's really,

192
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,410
really hard to produce just one.

193
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,790
So producing two is nearly impossible for society

194
00:08:31,799 --> 00:08:33,320
at the call that we accept right now.

195
00:08:33,619 --> 00:08:34,940
And that's also can be a discussion can.

196
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:38,799
And so there is not really a supply chain relationship because quite realistically

197
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:39,690
like

198
00:08:40,308 --> 00:08:44,539
everyone depend on, on the few people at open SSL everyone depend on open SSH,

199
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:50,369
everyone depend on bin for B GP and DNS and all that stuff, right? Like you

200
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,210
everyone depend on

201
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:52,770
um

202
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:58,179
we implement the NTP protocol and the GP sds that sync it with GPS data,

203
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,659
like all that stuff,

204
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:03,950
we all depend on a few people and a few specific library and there is not really any

205
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,869
competition you can have, right?

206
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:06,789
So

207
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,789
like when we frame it as a supply chain thing,

208
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,039
we are

209
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,750
missing that part because

210
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:19,150
I think II I finally found some data on this um in the Atlantic Council,

211
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,750
the city of few uh report that was published recently.

212
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,690
So they publish a few things

213
00:09:24,859 --> 00:09:25,260
in

214
00:09:25,489 --> 00:09:27,849
a random software product.

215
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,059
Any commercial software product you buy today,

216
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,489
80 to 90% of the code in it

217
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,859
will be free and open source software.

218
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,330
-- I think the number they said was 87%.
-- You see what I mean? Right? Like

219
00:09:42,619 --> 00:09:46,099
you can't just say that this is a supply chain relationship at this point because

220
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:47,780
like this is all of it.

221
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,289
Like

222
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,250
it's a whole product. But uh we and

223
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:54,880
why we are in this mess

224
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,679
is because we cannot cut part of it.

225
00:09:58,409 --> 00:09:59,760
Uh It's not like

226
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,080
like if you're in carf

227
00:10:01,349 --> 00:10:02,950
touring, for example, the

228
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:04,710
infotainment system, right?

229
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:08,590
The systems that do your radio and your music and all that stuff in the middle, right?

230
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:12,710
This big piece machines that run in the middle come from a supplier.

231
00:10:13,349 --> 00:10:16,010
It's really invented and, and created by

232
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:16,960
the cacs

233
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:18,989
themselves, they will tweak them a bit and all.

234
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,380
But there's a lot that come from the supplier

235
00:10:20,869 --> 00:10:24,510
and so you can pick your supplier depending on what you want it to be able to do.

236
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,250
Sometimes

237
00:10:25,479 --> 00:10:26,369
in software.

238
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:30,219
We don't forget that choice for nearly all the of three open source software we use,

239
00:10:30,489 --> 00:10:33,469
we have to use it because otherwise we can't even create

240
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:37,679
the thing we need because there is so many fundamental basic capabilities

241
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:41,429
that are only realistically provided by these fronts

242
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,630
and Softwares that are shared by everyone.

243
00:10:43,859 --> 00:10:48,549
-- Yeah.
-- No, I I remember paying money for the OS TCP/IP pack from IBM.

244
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:49,229
And,

245
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:52,809
and even there's a good example of like there, there was only the one option

246
00:10:52,929 --> 00:10:55,590
like it's not like there was a market for two of these

247
00:10:56,239 --> 00:11:00,630
and try to go in a market to buy a TCP/IP uh stock these days.

248
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,150
Yeah,

249
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:02,809
I mean, I'm,

250
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,950
I'm still actually kind of shocked that there are commercial TLS implementations.

251
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,169
There's a few floating around.

252
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,159
I just sure, I mean,

253
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:11,099
they are

254
00:11:11,469 --> 00:11:11,969
infinitely

255
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:14,130
small on the market, right?

256
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:20,130
So in practice, like the end of the rating for nearly every part of the stack, right?

257
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,049
You can find

258
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:25,320
you, you can especially on servers, it's a bit different on desktop but,

259
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:28,989
but on servers which is a vast majority of what we deal with and even

260
00:11:29,219 --> 00:11:32,440
on phones, which is a vast majority of the device these days,

261
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,760
you don't pay for the bugger.

262
00:11:33,789 --> 00:11:35,159
Not anymore. No, no,

263
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,429
not anymore.

264
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,039
But partially this is because the

265
00:11:39,169 --> 00:11:43,359
commercial one could not keep going because they were depending on so much.

266
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,960
Is there is so much we expect we, we take for granted.

267
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,200
Right. Like, could you imagine

268
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:51,650
having to pay for unicode handling?

269
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:54,960
-- No, I
-- think part of the challenge is,

270
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,729
and this came up with the, you know, when we talked with the lets encrypt

271
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:01,049
is that even if they charge a penny, that's such a huge barrier to entry.

272
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:02,950
And I'm just thinking like even a desktop.

273
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,710
So relatively quote unquote simple system, you know,

274
00:12:05,979 --> 00:12:11,349
if I had to pay for, yeah, TLSATLS library, not just a server but

275
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,330
yeah, for all these core

276
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:15,989
like NTP, like you mentioned or, or a bind resolver.

277
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,700
Like I'm just thinking now when I bought the OS two TCP/IP pack,

278
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:21,299
I guess it was sort of implicit that they also gave

279
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:23,559
me DNS support because now that I say it out loud,

280
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:27,679
it's like, well, it's TCP/IP. Oh, you want a DNS as well? That's another one.

281
00:12:27,989 --> 00:12:31,059
And I actually did, in fact have to pay for the NFS pack as well.

282
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:35,520
Like I bought the TCP/IP pack and the NFS pack. It's about 400 bucks.

283
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:38,739
And now my OS two machine could talk to my Linux machine and then

284
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,320
I eventually decided to just go with Linux because it all came for free.

285
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:46,429
Ok. I wanna, I wanna bring us back to, to something Tomas said

286
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:50,450
you compared open source to infrastructure,

287
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,739
which I think your description of you have to use it is reasonable

288
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,799
because like my favorite example is we'll say roads or the electric grid.

289
00:12:57,809 --> 00:13:00,640
It's easy to say, oh, I could do it myself. But the reality is you can't,

290
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:04,000
you have to use the public infrastructure that exists.

291
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:06,109
But in the context of infrastructure,

292
00:13:06,349 --> 00:13:07,719
infrastructure is

293
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:11,880
heavily regulated by the local government. Generally speaking.

294
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:12,840
Well,

295
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:15,349
the generally speaking, make a lot of heavy lifting

296
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,059
-- and, and I
-- think that's,

297
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,770
-- that's my weasel word
-- out.

298
00:13:20,349 --> 00:13:20,820
And,

299
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:25,059
and I think so the first thing I want to point out is that not open sources like that,

300
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:26,500
right?

301
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,609
Like open

302
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:27,919
source.

303
00:13:27,929 --> 00:13:33,359
And, and that's kind of why III I try to stop talking of open source security as a, as a,

304
00:13:33,369 --> 00:13:34,020
as a old topic.

305
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:37,640
And I think that's, that's when we compare to party open source can be anything,

306
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:37,979
right?

307
00:13:37,989 --> 00:13:40,349
If I write a small library that, uh,

308
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:42,580
change the color of a web page because that's

309
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,760
what I wanted to show to my daughter or something

310
00:13:44,969 --> 00:13:47,130
that and I publish it. This is open source, right?

311
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:51,109
And basically no one care about that. And there's a lot of project like that. Sure,

312
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:54,710
I can do a small training project to explore something.

313
00:13:54,719 --> 00:13:56,039
And so, and no one care about that.

314
00:13:56,049 --> 00:13:59,429
And that's a lot of open source libraries out there, right?

315
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:02,349
But already that they also sell the ones that are not used that much,

316
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:03,340
but it doesn't matter.

317
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:03,710
Right.

318
00:14:03,989 --> 00:14:04,570
So, and,

319
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,609
and that's kind of why I try to not talk

320
00:14:06,619 --> 00:14:10,169
about open source as something that is so important.

321
00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:11,330
II I emphasize the in fact

322
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,340
part because

323
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,169
I think the part we came about when we talk about security is that part,

324
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,679
right? It is that particular part that we use that is everywhere.

325
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:22,989
And that is now fundamental because you can build whatever you want.

326
00:14:23,109 --> 00:14:24,919
If the libraries that on

327
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:25,809
your image

328
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:29,789
as a security so bad that you get rooted when you receive an

329
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:30,479
iMessage,

330
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,489
I am definitely not calling out a particular case here.

331
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,309
Um

332
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,539
Like

333
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,960
you can build all the sandbox you want if just receiving the

334
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,359
iMessage and discovering that there is an image in it is enough

335
00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:44,789
to route the whole phone and give access to the attack.

336
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,669
Like the sandbox doesn't matter at this point, right?

337
00:14:48,169 --> 00:14:48,820
So

338
00:14:49,109 --> 00:14:51,640
and, and that's kind of why I think and so

339
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,830
so first that that's the first bit I would bring

340
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:58,429
the second one that bring us to a discussion I think about the comments,

341
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:01,919
right? Which is a sentence that people in open source we have heard before, right?

342
00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:05,409
The so called tragedy of the comments. I I did hair

343
00:15:05,729 --> 00:15:07,150
cut here for people listening at home.

344
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:10,299
Um And, and what that thing is that

345
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,250
the idea of the community itself has a lot of sense, right?

346
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,919
This idea is that as a group,

347
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,000
you have a shared resource or shared capabilities, right?

348
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:23,190
Something that benefit to everyone that need to be managed right and governed.

349
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:26,205
The tragedy of the country is a particular

350
00:15:26,575 --> 00:15:29,294
discussion around that, that explains that if it's shared,

351
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:32,724
but anyone profit but no one you know, is responsible and everything,

352
00:15:32,734 --> 00:15:34,244
then things do not get done.

353
00:15:34,515 --> 00:15:36,885
Uh This tragedy of the commons has been

354
00:15:37,575 --> 00:15:42,155
so thoroughly debunked by sociological research that does not really work that way

355
00:15:42,434 --> 00:15:43,484
because what happened

356
00:15:43,655 --> 00:15:48,844
is that when you have a, a group share the result that is important and they organize

357
00:15:49,174 --> 00:15:50,255
to handle it.

358
00:15:50,364 --> 00:15:53,414
And one of the way as we were talking about is go,

359
00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:55,059
right.

360
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,840
That's one of the way we have found as a group to organize,

361
00:15:58,849 --> 00:16:02,400
to manage a common and government tend to appeal

362
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:04,739
because we have something in common to manage.

363
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,739
Right? It's not a magical thing that come down and all it. And so

364
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,059
when you talk about, they tend to be regulated.

365
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,210
Yes.

366
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:12,539
That's because as a group,

367
00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:15,380
we decided to regulate it because we needed them to be regulated.

368
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:19,010
We decided that was how we were going to govern and manage them.

369
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:19,650
Right.

370
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,369
But there's a lot of station when that's not the case,

371
00:16:22,659 --> 00:16:23,030
right?

372
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,969
If you share, I don't know if you buy a lawn mower with your neighbor and you share it,

373
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,580
which is not something that never happened.

374
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:31,619
You probably don't need the government to regulate that.

375
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,450
You just work together on that. Right?

376
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,400
And, and there is a lot of situation like that.

377
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,080
-- Well,
-- but there would still be, for example,

378
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,820
civil law that would regulate that to some degree

379
00:16:40,929 --> 00:16:42,039
at a high level.

380
00:16:42,549 --> 00:16:43,030
I mean,

381
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:44,270
yes,

382
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,130
in practice,

383
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,969
if you just enter in an agreement with your neighbor to share the law more,

384
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:50,840
one of you will buy it and you will give you money and

385
00:16:50,849 --> 00:16:53,840
basically you on civil laws that will not be really beyond it's yours.

386
00:16:53,849 --> 00:16:55,659
But it's a use case. It's definitely,

387
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,599
if you want to

388
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,940
handle it properly through all kind of law,

389
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,440
you would have to create a corporation to deal with that

390
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,410
because that's the way we introducing. Right.

391
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:05,459
No,

392
00:17:05,469 --> 00:17:09,800
what I'm saying is if I enter into a verbal agreement with Josh to share a lawn mower,

393
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:10,839
that

394
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,310
is a verbal agreement, it's a contract and now there would be civil law and stuff.

395
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,510
But I mean, and that's sort of at a meta level,

396
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,300
it always kind of reminds me of one of the roles

397
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,239
of government is to sort of be like parents and like,

398
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,050
ok, Children

399
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,358
try to work it out yourselves and if you can't work it out,

400
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:27,160
then we'll step in if we have to, but we would prefer not to.

401
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,640
It would be nicer if you two could just work it out and not bug us,

402
00:17:29,979 --> 00:17:32,770
you know, just share the hot dog and be done with it. But I think you

403
00:17:33,209 --> 00:17:34,900
see, and the other thing I,

404
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,300
I with respect to the whole tragedy of the

405
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,719
commons is the one thing I've always noted is that

406
00:17:39,979 --> 00:17:42,959
you can't sort of overuse software. Like,

407
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,619
I mean, well, ok, in theory, if too many people downloaded it,

408
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:48,939
that could be a problem like the site crashes, but we'll ignore that.

409
00:17:48,949 --> 00:17:50,540
And the one thing that does, I,

410
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:55,099
I keep coming back to is this sort of idea of responsible and sustainable use.

411
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:56,150
Because for example,

412
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:59,369
while if I just download the software and never bug the person again,

413
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:00,920
a million people can do that.

414
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:04,599
But if I download the software and then start making demands from that person,

415
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,579
well, that's not going to be fun for him if you know 100 people do that.

416
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:12,390
I guess what I'm saying is I don't think the tragedy of the commons works per se

417
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,500
but that it does maybe have some cautionary tales for us to consider.

418
00:18:16,689 --> 00:18:20,930
I think the mistake here is to consider that it's a software that

419
00:18:20,939 --> 00:18:23,699
is a resource and that we will need to make it sustainable.

420
00:18:23,709 --> 00:18:26,569
I think the, because the comments is not about or

421
00:18:26,694 --> 00:18:28,385
source by itself, it can be a

422
00:18:28,494 --> 00:18:29,055
lot of things.

423
00:18:29,064 --> 00:18:34,055
And I think in part, in this case, the the the mistake is to consider that, I mean,

424
00:18:34,064 --> 00:18:34,895
the mistake, I don't know.

425
00:18:34,954 --> 00:18:36,635
But the way we think of it

426
00:18:36,814 --> 00:18:41,665
is that the software need constant work

427
00:18:41,685 --> 00:18:44,555
and that's something that has not always been

428
00:18:44,704 --> 00:18:48,314
appreciated and accepted, especially by free and open source communities.

429
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:52,099
But if you look at what we know about software engineering,

430
00:18:52,109 --> 00:18:53,660
especially software engineering.

431
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,189
In the reality of today,

432
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:56,579
software

433
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,270
once produced,

434
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:02,430
we can copy it as much as you want, right? You can make copy for free.

435
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:03,750
That's the great thing about software

436
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,359
that does not mean that the way the software works

437
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:10,119
is good and will keep being good

438
00:19:10,969 --> 00:19:13,979
and, and that sounds dumb because you think yes, the source code is the same,

439
00:19:13,989 --> 00:19:15,109
the code is the same.

440
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,469
Why we bit rot, right?

441
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:20,589
It's not going to rot like a piece of, of, you know, food or something.

442
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:24,829
The problem is that software is fundamentally contextual software

443
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:27,599
only makes sense in a part when it's,

444
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:29,089
it's created

445
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:33,729
with a certain context in mind with a certain way to use it with a certain way

446
00:19:33,869 --> 00:19:36,280
with a certain kind of hardware that will run

447
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:39,069
it with a certain kind of environment around it.

448
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:41,920
This environment is not static.

449
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,239
Quite the contrary, the more you use it,

450
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,150
the more this environment tend to change because another

451
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,989
character of software is that it changed its own environment

452
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,359
now that unicode is hand everywhere because a lot

453
00:19:53,369 --> 00:19:55,069
of people spend a lot of time on this.

454
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,189
Well, now everyone expects unicode everywhere.

455
00:19:59,089 --> 00:20:01,910
And if you don't have emojis, people will get hungry,

456
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:02,949
right?

457
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,109
And so, right?

458
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,930
Like and, and not only emojis,

459
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,510
but they will want custom emojis pretty fast

460
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,420
and that's not handled by the Unicode consortium.

461
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,250
So you better sit down and invent a new way

462
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,290
to do things otherwise you're going to have problems,

463
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:15,609
right?

464
00:20:15,619 --> 00:20:17,089
And now all the F

465
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:19,510
ring that has done all this work for Unicode,

466
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,270
they have to deal with that and they are probably not ready for it, right?

467
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:26,630
And we get in this cycle because software fundamentally change the game,

468
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,060
right? It gives you new tools and that tool change what you can do. So now you need

469
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,900
the tools to change with you. And so we end up in the situation where

470
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,979
by definition of existing and being used

471
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,060
and the more it's used, the more it's true,

472
00:20:40,069 --> 00:20:42,300
the more the software needs work and maintenance.

473
00:20:42,739 --> 00:20:45,260
So we still have this kind of problem, right?

474
00:20:45,459 --> 00:20:47,719
The other reason being that

475
00:20:47,969 --> 00:20:50,630
usually and that's also something we can,

476
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,439
we, we, we, we are getting slightly better at

477
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:54,770
the software

478
00:20:54,989 --> 00:20:57,869
as written when we talk about fixes,

479
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,869
right? We talk about fixing bugs,

480
00:21:00,449 --> 00:21:03,859
usually fixing bugs is not going in and changing it and for

481
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:04,270
all

482
00:21:04,569 --> 00:21:06,750
or doing a small obvious change,

483
00:21:06,939 --> 00:21:08,250
right? That happens, right?

484
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,689
Sometimes something that should be superior or equal,

485
00:21:10,699 --> 00:21:12,770
we just write to that superior and that's a problem.

486
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:16,989
But usually what we discover when we need to fix a bug, right

487
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,030
is that

488
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,229
you need to fundamentally change

489
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:22,369
how the software work.

490
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:26,829
-- I mean, worse, you have to actually define what the correct behavior is,
-- right.

491
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:27,140
Yeah.

492
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,630
Oh, maybe there is multiple and then you need to undergo multiple, right?

493
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,910
But the reality is that changing

494
00:21:33,089 --> 00:21:36,949
this fundamental reality of what the software is, right?

495
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:41,430
Usually need a huge body of the knowledge of how it already works.

496
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,459
And also of all the techniques that you're going to need to get that.

497
00:21:45,619 --> 00:21:49,000
And if you don't have that, then the time to get need also,

498
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:52,189
you need also to be able to acquire that, which is also a pretty long time.

499
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:53,520
Usually it's quite expensive.

500
00:21:53,869 --> 00:21:58,670
And so you get in this situation where yes, technically we cannot overuse it,

501
00:21:59,199 --> 00:22:00,219
but also

502
00:22:00,449 --> 00:22:03,959
it does need a baseline of maintenance

503
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,839
and that baseline of maintenance if it's used tend to grow.

504
00:22:08,719 --> 00:22:09,560
And that was, I mean,

505
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,160
right now, for a lot of front

506
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,250
or software does not exist.

507
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:16,150
And so that's where we get into the problem

508
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,050
of security. Like the, the look for shell case is visible lately, right?

509
00:22:21,199 --> 00:22:23,859
Like log for J if you talk to the maintenance,

510
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:28,405
they would have loved to get three of the capabilities that was used for this escape

511
00:22:28,685 --> 00:22:29,824
a long time ago.

512
00:22:29,935 --> 00:22:32,045
But once they have a limited time,

513
00:22:32,224 --> 00:22:34,555
two, they don't really know how people use it,

514
00:22:34,564 --> 00:22:37,484
but also like they don't have time to deal with the

515
00:22:37,494 --> 00:22:40,275
impact if they delete it and people can deal with it.

516
00:22:40,535 --> 00:22:42,564
And they did not really know

517
00:22:43,035 --> 00:22:46,364
how they could provide an equivalent use case,

518
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:49,750
right? They have done a lot of work and so they couldn't do it.

519
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,650
So they just kept it kept it around.

520
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:56,650
And so we get in these situations where as a society, we want all these things,

521
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:57,489
right?

522
00:22:57,719 --> 00:23:01,150
We want this baseline of capabilities for tools,

523
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,729
we want encrypted communications, right?

524
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,150
Like this

525
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:05,810
definition, we want that

526
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:11,489
what we have not answered as society so far is how do we get that?

527
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,359
How do we maintain that and how do we

528
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:16,800
make sure that this level happen and is sustainable?

529
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:23,469
And so I, I, so that's why I try to walk down a bit from the

530
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:24,469
using,

531
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:30,739
right is using resources and consuming resources because I think at this point,

532
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,189
the same thing with a road, right?

533
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:35,189
I don't exactly consume a road when I use it.

534
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:37,849
I mean, I kind of do uh you know,

535
00:23:37,859 --> 00:23:40,709
there is all kind of situation where I do have impact and that's managed.

536
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:43,729
But usually if I go walk on the road on a paved road,

537
00:23:43,739 --> 00:23:45,459
I'm not going to do that much damage,

538
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:48,119
but it does need maintenance because there are

539
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,420
all kind of external parameters that impact it,

540
00:23:50,619 --> 00:23:51,050
right?

541
00:23:51,089 --> 00:23:52,660
And that's why I pay taxes and all that stuff,

542
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,479
despite the fact that I don't use it that much.

543
00:23:55,459 --> 00:23:56,219
And

544
00:23:56,699 --> 00:23:59,040
that's a discussion we have not have

545
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:00,369
for

546
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,280
digital infrastructure

547
00:24:02,709 --> 00:24:04,479
and partial is because it's so new,

548
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:07,619
right? This is the description we have we are having right now,

549
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,119
but that's kind of why I got it.

550
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:15,890
So I like the way you split the difference between kind of using and maintenance.

551
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,949
And I think the Atlantic Council report does a nice job of this as well where they,

552
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:23,270
they kind of treat the using of open source like the,

553
00:24:23,489 --> 00:24:24,869
the water system

554
00:24:25,579 --> 00:24:28,410
in the context of like anyone can go and use it.

555
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,319
But obviously, if you pollute it and make a mess now no one can use it.

556
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,449
And the maintenance aspect, they,

557
00:24:33,609 --> 00:24:36,560
they use infrastructure as a good example where something like

558
00:24:36,979 --> 00:24:38,640
maintaining roads

559
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,000
isn't really a profit center.

560
00:24:41,069 --> 00:24:44,750
And so it's one of those things that like, if a government doesn't do it,

561
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:50,040
there's really no way you're going to have economically viable roads. Right.

562
00:24:50,209 --> 00:24:50,839
Well, I mean,

563
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:53,119
I've played simcity and that's the first thing you cut back

564
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,160
and then everything goes all to hell in a hand basket.

565
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,290
But the other thing I'm thinking of is is there's almost a,

566
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,479
there's this positive feedback loop as, as a project becomes better,

567
00:25:01,489 --> 00:25:04,400
it becomes more used and it has to interoperate with more things.

568
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:07,969
So, a great example of this is like lip curl, lip curl handles, like

569
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:08,880
every

570
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,079
horrific corner case

571
00:25:11,229 --> 00:25:12,119
that we know of.

572
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:15,359
And as a consequence, it is horrific,

573
00:25:15,369 --> 00:25:19,119
like it is really complex and there's a lot of subtle stuff in there.

574
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:22,310
And so, yeah, for somebody to come in and maintain, you know, I'm always, uh,

575
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:24,560
Josh is gonna hate this, but like to quote unquote,

576
00:25:24,569 --> 00:25:28,119
fix a pothole in the road is not just fill it with cold patch and walk away.

577
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:30,459
Right. Like it is to properly fix a road.

578
00:25:30,469 --> 00:25:33,380
I love how people complain about roads when they're being properly fixed because it

579
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:35,959
takes like a week or two because you have to like tamp stuff down,

580
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:37,439
let it settle, tamp it again.

581
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:39,849
You know, we had a new overpass that was built and

582
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:42,469
a year later there's like these 1 ft,

583
00:25:42,619 --> 00:25:44,410
like 30 centimeter, like

584
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,569
lumps in the road basically

585
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:48,790
that they're like, yeah, that's normal. That was expected.

586
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,589
And we're just gonna have to fix it because it takes time for all the soil to settle.

587
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:55,599
And I did actually some research on the soil settling and it turns out

588
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,949
like if you want to build something,

589
00:25:56,959 --> 00:26:01,229
say 6 ft high and 100 m long and have it not settle and move.

590
00:26:01,489 --> 00:26:05,109
It is just so complicated, it doesn't even bear discussion.

591
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,300
Um

592
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:10,489
And I mean, that's where all this good software like log for J is going.

593
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:14,989
But I also worry that sometimes these maintainers, for example, I'll pick on log

594
00:26:15,099 --> 00:26:15,530
for J.

595
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:18,170
They were worried about the impact of removing this

596
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,530
dangerous feature in that people might be using it.

597
00:26:20,739 --> 00:26:22,050
And my thought is

598
00:26:22,339 --> 00:26:25,849
well, too bad like because if you are using this feature, maybe

599
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:26,979
need to step up

600
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,300
and support it

601
00:26:28,579 --> 00:26:29,500
or pay for it.

602
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,969
Um Another great example, remember Open SSH had that remote key exposure thing

603
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:35,959
and it was in a feature that a company

604
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:39,319
could kind of asked for to support ssh roaming sessions

605
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,359
that it turns out.

606
00:26:40,369 --> 00:26:40,729
Well,

607
00:26:40,739 --> 00:26:42,380
nobody ever used and we know nobody ever used

608
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,489
it because we actually never had client support.

609
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:47,219
So it was just dead code on the server

610
00:26:47,449 --> 00:26:49,660
that, you know, then they finally removed and the prom went away.

611
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,410
And so I can't help but think maybe people

612
00:26:52,609 --> 00:26:57,270
have created this trap for themselves by being too nice by being too generous

613
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,569
and doing everything that these companies want and say,

614
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:01,209
OK,

615
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,959
that's exactly.

616
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:03,670
I think Josh,

617
00:27:03,699 --> 00:27:07,280
you may remember I reacted to that same argument you had for the first time.

618
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,849
You talked about my blog post.

619
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:12,250
I think it was the ecology discussion, pollution discussion.

620
00:27:12,449 --> 00:27:15,369
And you ended up in something quite like that and I reacted a

621
00:27:15,479 --> 00:27:19,439
bit harsh and thats the thing where we discussed of guilt. I think

622
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:23,040
so I'm going to be really nice and try to use.

623
00:27:23,069 --> 00:27:27,060
So I spend a lot of time in researching safety science

624
00:27:27,239 --> 00:27:29,510
and with a lot of people that work in that field.

625
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,550
So we are talking field like, you know, uh airplanes, pilots, um ship railways,

626
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,619
nuclear power plant, chemical plants, all that stuff, right?

627
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:38,849
And

628
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:44,089
there have been a drive in a part of the committee, particularly in the

629
00:27:44,209 --> 00:27:48,819
S and SRE software community uh to get some links to

630
00:27:48,829 --> 00:27:52,229
these people because we feel that there is AAA Kindling here,

631
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:52,670
right?

632
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,390
One of the things we discovered from safety science

633
00:27:55,655 --> 00:28:00,155
is that there is something true across every

634
00:28:00,165 --> 00:28:03,824
single safety critical industry they have looked at,

635
00:28:03,834 --> 00:28:04,875
which is that

636
00:28:05,045 --> 00:28:08,775
when you ask for a report or an explanation or analysis

637
00:28:08,785 --> 00:28:11,234
of a problem of an incident or something like that,

638
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,910
it always end up the story,

639
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,969
the narrative always end up

640
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:17,859
at

641
00:28:18,109 --> 00:28:20,130
a human, took the wrong decision.

642
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,469
And usually this is explained in terms that we use could would or should.

643
00:28:27,619 --> 00:28:28,290
And

644
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,829
there is a whole body of research on that kind of things.

645
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,050
And what this body of research says usually is that this

646
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:38,449
is really practical to find a reason for what something happened.

647
00:28:38,459 --> 00:28:40,209
But it's really really rarely

648
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,349
achieve a change.

649
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,329
Like it is a great way to explain a cause of how something happened,

650
00:28:47,869 --> 00:28:51,989
but it has really resulted in changes that make things better.

651
00:28:52,229 --> 00:28:57,949
And so what happened is that the safety science researcher call this a first story,

652
00:28:58,459 --> 00:29:01,229
right? It's the first story you get when you do your analysis

653
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:05,209
and then there is a whole body of research on what they call second story,

654
00:29:05,569 --> 00:29:07,329
which is the stories that start

655
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:10,510
at this decision that was made by the people, right?

656
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,489
Usually what they call the sharp and the people that are the

657
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:16,599
forefront of the decision making. And

658
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:22,420
you start your story here and then you start here and you start asking questions like

659
00:29:22,729 --> 00:29:24,930
how did that make sense at the time?

660
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:28,089
What was the constraint and pressures they were dealing with?

661
00:29:28,339 --> 00:29:31,930
What were the way they were trained into doing their work?

662
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,140
What are the, because

663
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,020
usually when people take this kind of decision,

664
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:41,349
they take a rational decision for a good reason,

665
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,510
especially experts in this kind of important stuff,

666
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:48,390
right? Usually when you're an expert at that level and I, I

667
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,829
mean, if you maintain lip

668
00:29:49,959 --> 00:29:53,609
girl, you're an expert, I'm sorry, like that's the reality of the whole thing,

669
00:29:53,619 --> 00:29:53,890
right?

670
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:54,869
You,

671
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,550
you are an expert in that domain and so you take your decision,

672
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,949
you have a good understanding.

673
00:29:58,959 --> 00:29:59,500
You have a

674
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:03,079
usually you understand the impact of your decisions.

675
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:04,170
Like the open

676
00:30:04,505 --> 00:30:06,265
people are partially from

677
00:30:06,584 --> 00:30:10,275
linked to open BS D like they know the impact of security, right? Like

678
00:30:10,484 --> 00:30:13,275
to the point that a lot of people would say they are obnoxious about it, but they know,

679
00:30:13,305 --> 00:30:13,834
right?

680
00:30:13,844 --> 00:30:14,415
So

681
00:30:14,525 --> 00:30:16,935
and so the question is how did we got the system,

682
00:30:16,944 --> 00:30:20,234
this whole thing to the point where that was the right decision to take?

683
00:30:20,244 --> 00:30:20,694
And

684
00:30:20,864 --> 00:30:23,494
if you based on this second story, if you don't,

685
00:30:23,505 --> 00:30:26,734
if every time you had a shoot could wood, right?

686
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:30,349
A counterfactual, the official term because it's a

687
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,969
fact that never happened, right? It's not the reality.

688
00:30:33,989 --> 00:30:35,890
Then if, but if you study the reality,

689
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:40,109
then you can tease out what makes this happen and then

690
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:43,750
maybe you can start to find solution or place to look at

691
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,469
and more importantly,

692
00:30:45,479 --> 00:30:48,949
you can at least convey that narrative and that story to other people

693
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:53,260
so that they can take the decisions that would impact that narrative and that story,

694
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:53,979
right?

695
00:30:54,569 --> 00:30:58,430
So that they can change how they see things. Because as long as we say,

696
00:30:58,829 --> 00:30:59,109
the

697
00:30:59,459 --> 00:31:02,310
people, maybe there should be less noise or maybe they should,

698
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:04,109
the reality that what we're doing here

699
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,130
is that we are getting rid of the problem.

700
00:31:06,439 --> 00:31:08,920
We are saying that this is not a problem of the environment.

701
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,380
This is not a problem of the constraints line.

702
00:31:10,439 --> 00:31:12,790
This is not a problem of the work being unsustainable.

703
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,119
This is not a problem of us using this wrong. This is not a problem of anyone.

704
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,469
It's them having not taken the correct decision.

705
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:20,969
And so we just have to tell them to take the right

706
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:23,150
one or better one next time and we can move on,

707
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:23,599
right?

708
00:31:23,609 --> 00:31:24,109
And

709
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:27,550
that does not to say that it's not something that makes us feel better, right?

710
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,459
Usually does. And it's really easy and we need that closure,

711
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,979
but it really end up

712
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,640
in positive change.

713
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:37,920
And so if people listeners are partly interested

714
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,479
into exploring that there is a good book,

715
00:31:40,489 --> 00:31:42,510
I advise by Synet Decker

716
00:31:42,949 --> 00:31:46,680
called The Field Guide To An Understanding Human Error,

717
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:50,319
which is um a, a staple of the field.

718
00:31:50,329 --> 00:31:53,920
It's a book we give to everyone that come into this domain.

719
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:57,000
Like you remember quickly, I remember Netflix at some point,

720
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:00,579
bought them by the dozens to give them to some of the engineers.

721
00:32:00,589 --> 00:32:01,469
So uh

722
00:32:01,869 --> 00:32:04,199
so I advise uh it's a good start.

723
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,739
And, and so, so that's, that's the first thing I would say.

724
00:32:07,439 --> 00:32:08,949
And so in that case,

725
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,209
I would bring the question,

726
00:32:10,339 --> 00:32:12,869
what made them take that decision at the time

727
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,689
and more importantly,

728
00:32:14,729 --> 00:32:17,709
what would we need to change for them to take a different decisions?

729
00:32:18,339 --> 00:32:22,400
OK, I have a clarifying question for this story you're telling right now.

730
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:24,560
Are we applying this to the,

731
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:28,719
the like the companies consuming the open source? Are we applying this to the

732
00:32:28,849 --> 00:32:32,609
-- creators of the open source?
-- So I apply that to the maintainers?

733
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:34,310
Because realistically Xia

734
00:32:34,709 --> 00:32:38,180
-- is the only one that can do the change we need if you want security.
-- Sure.

735
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,239
OK. OK.

736
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:43,119
Then the next question I have is I feel like this is putting undue

737
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:47,239
burden on the open source maintainers or am I misunderstanding your your point?

738
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,420
No, I I think that the contrary,

739
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:51,359
I think the rate is that right now by

740
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:54,630
saying they should would or could have done differently,

741
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,719
we are putting on the burden on them.

742
00:32:57,030 --> 00:33:00,270
And we're saying is if we want to progress as a society,

743
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,790
if we want to have more security in our digital infrastructure,

744
00:33:03,099 --> 00:33:04,459
we need to stop doing that,

745
00:33:04,469 --> 00:33:07,910
we need to stop putting this burden on them and we need to start looking at

746
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,579
what that burden is.

747
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,969
What do they deal with?

748
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:13,739
Why do they take the decision and take that burden in

749
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:19,579
and then we can start to talk about how we can support that or change that situation?

750
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:19,829
I

751
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:20,380
see.

752
00:33:20,469 --> 00:33:22,760
So would an example of this be, for example,

753
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,729
like looking at the burden on the open source maintainers?

754
00:33:24,739 --> 00:33:27,300
Obviously, if you make a breaking change, people yell at you. OK.

755
00:33:27,349 --> 00:33:30,880
How do we get people to not yell at them about breaking changes or to notify

756
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:34,219
them in advance that this would be a breaking change and so on and so forth.

757
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,819
Yes, I would be even more direct.

758
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,290
Yeah.

759
00:33:37,385 --> 00:33:39,444
Well, because the one thing I keep coming back to is also,

760
00:33:39,464 --> 00:33:42,685
there is a big assumption here is that if they made a different decision,

761
00:33:42,694 --> 00:33:45,125
it would be a more correct or better decision.

762
00:33:45,135 --> 00:33:45,395
And

763
00:33:45,574 --> 00:33:49,625
that may not be the case like we might have had a worse outcome, had they removed it.

764
00:33:50,334 --> 00:33:53,645
And then the second thing is so let's ignore that for a moment.

765
00:33:53,655 --> 00:33:56,204
We'll just, we'll pretend that we're making good decisions.

766
00:33:56,814 --> 00:34:00,555
Fundamentally. I feel like it keeps coming back to all these economic incentives

767
00:34:00,979 --> 00:34:02,819
of, you know, I as a maintainer,

768
00:34:02,829 --> 00:34:06,170
do I want people yelling at me or do I just want this unknown?

769
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,410
But maybe zero,

770
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:11,449
maybe larger than zero risk of a security issue if I don't tidy up this code.

771
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:11,639
Yeah.

772
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:12,040
You know what,

773
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,050
I'll take it because nobody's yelling at me right now and if I remove it,

774
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:15,840
they will for sure.

775
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:16,370
Yell at me.

776
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,250
There is a

777
00:34:17,438 --> 00:34:21,060
thing here which I think is kind of something I would tease out

778
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:24,688
and want to buy it is your use of want as a maintainer.

779
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:26,800
Usually it's not about what I want,

780
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,600
it's about what I can do.

781
00:34:29,438 --> 00:34:32,540
And, and that's what I'm saying when I say about the constraints.

782
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:36,219
Right. It's not only because it's not like I'm just, uh, isolate

783
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:38,449
my decision in isolation. Right.

784
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,449
I maintain a few open source thing

785
00:34:40,899 --> 00:34:44,739
up until really recently I had two hours every quarter

786
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,418
to spend on open source

787
00:34:47,299 --> 00:34:49,428
for a lot of personal reasons. That's all the time.

788
00:34:49,438 --> 00:34:51,188
I could actually, I could put it right.

789
00:34:51,197 --> 00:34:53,648
And I don't think that's a particularly, like,

790
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:56,009
that's kind of an extreme case but not that extreme.

791
00:34:56,018 --> 00:34:58,099
I think it's a reality of a lot of source maintenance.

792
00:34:58,108 --> 00:35:02,039
Oh, no, we ran into it all the time at Red Hat, like the XML hash dogs and the guy,

793
00:35:02,049 --> 00:35:03,769
like I can do this in three months.

794
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:05,099
Exactly. Right.

795
00:35:05,229 --> 00:35:10,249
So, if we do that, then if we accept that, then the rating is not what I want.

796
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:12,289
It's what do I budget for.

797
00:35:12,908 --> 00:35:14,918
Because if I have two hours every quarter

798
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,729
doing the work to get rid of something relatively complex that will impact my test,

799
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:23,689
my, my test shoot where I will have to get rid of some and maybe change some and all.

800
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,320
And that will take me 10 hours.

801
00:35:25,489 --> 00:35:28,469
Well, if I do that, then I'm going to do nothing else for you?

802
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:30,550
Wow. Yeah. Yeah.

803
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,350
But that's the reality of it. Right.

804
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:33,949
And so if

805
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,800
we want to start having that discussion,

806
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:39,260
we need to start having the discussion about the reality of what it is

807
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:42,870
to be maintainers and what are the constraint and pressure that they deal with.

808
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:43,479
Right.

809
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,679
And that's something, and especially when I talk about time,

810
00:35:46,689 --> 00:35:49,750
that's something where I am really critical of

811
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,520
the open source security action we see out there

812
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:57,379
and partly we are going to come back to it, the software supply chain

813
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,679
one, right?

814
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:02,679
Slcasls a come to mind and all the good stuff coming out of Google,

815
00:36:02,689 --> 00:36:05,229
but also the open sec open SSO

816
00:36:05,379 --> 00:36:06,070
SSL F

817
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,409
the open SSF

818
00:36:08,469 --> 00:36:08,600
Thank you.

819
00:36:10,219 --> 00:36:10,879
Like

820
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,149
I look at what they offer as solutions,

821
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:14,790
right?

822
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,000
And they come from a great place,

823
00:36:17,229 --> 00:36:19,800
right? Like I'm not saying that they want to make things worse.

824
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:22,120
I don't think that's the case when I look at, what is that? Right?

825
00:36:22,129 --> 00:36:24,239
Like II, I want to acknowledge that, right?

826
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,520
It's people that want to make something better.

827
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:29,189
But when I look at what is offered, it's all more burdens.

828
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:31,870
It's, you need to make your software reproducible.

829
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,820
Well, this point I know that can be really hard in some build system.

830
00:36:35,959 --> 00:36:39,189
You need to add your signature on every come.

831
00:36:39,469 --> 00:36:41,709
Well, that's an additional thing I need to maintain.

832
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:44,030
And if I change computer and I change my key and I losses,

833
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,939
that's a lot of work you need to have a well.

834
00:36:46,949 --> 00:36:49,610
Ok, doable, not too hard.

835
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,610
Um You also need to

836
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:52,780
like if you receive a valle,

837
00:36:52,929 --> 00:36:54,399
you need to disclose it

838
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:57,639
quickly if I have two hours every quarter and I just use

839
00:36:57,649 --> 00:36:59,760
my two hours for this quarter and I receive a valr.

840
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:03,760
Do I take on something else to disclose it or do I wait a quarter?

841
00:37:03,879 --> 00:37:04,250
Right.

842
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,830
You also have that.

843
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,379
There is and also we are going to audit,

844
00:37:08,389 --> 00:37:10,290
you are going to do security audit on your code.

845
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,949
We are going to fuzz your code for you.

846
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:12,919
Great.

847
00:37:12,929 --> 00:37:15,159
Now you are going to come back to me with the issues

848
00:37:15,169 --> 00:37:16,909
I need to fix and I don't have time for that,

849
00:37:17,189 --> 00:37:17,610
right?

850
00:37:17,919 --> 00:37:18,860
And but that the real

851
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:19,979
of it, right? So

852
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:22,300
all of this come from a great place.

853
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:25,320
It's a, it's a place of care and of wanting the right thing,

854
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:28,780
but it comes also from a place I feel that does not

855
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:32,330
analyze the reality of what the maintenance as and their needs,

856
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,199
right?

857
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:35,540
And so we come with a solution we think will

858
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:38,469
work and would work probably better in commercial software,

859
00:37:39,129 --> 00:37:44,280
but that may not fit the reality of what we deal with. And that's kind also why I'm

860
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:47,199
having problem with the supply generation discussion, right?

861
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:49,610
Because the you know, supply generation

862
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,639
you as a user

863
00:37:51,889 --> 00:37:54,040
provide me with the needs

864
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:59,260
to fix the problem because you pay me, I make money from what you are using from me,

865
00:37:59,270 --> 00:37:59,610
right?

866
00:38:00,899 --> 00:38:05,199
As a not maintainer, I do not have resources except the free time I give

867
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,979
and my knowledge

868
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:11,729
and that is a highly competed for resource,

869
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,000
right?

870
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:16,699
And, and so, so we get into this discussion where I,

871
00:38:16,709 --> 00:38:20,399
I feel like a lot of the discussion we have and that's why I love the Atlantic

872
00:38:20,409 --> 00:38:23,199
Council uh report because I think they do talk

873
00:38:23,209 --> 00:38:25,300
about that all Road and Bridget report by Nadia

874
00:38:25,459 --> 00:38:25,560
Eba

875
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:27,040
right before that

876
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:27,790
from the

877
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:30,639
nation because they do talk about this, they have,

878
00:38:30,649 --> 00:38:33,360
they went to talk with the maintenance to talk about the maintenance problem.

879
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,689
And when I see the openness, they say,

880
00:38:35,929 --> 00:38:41,159
oh, I see a million millions dollars spent on security for open source, right?

881
00:38:41,169 --> 00:38:45,929
I see the big like the Alpha and Omega program of all these big numbers next to them.

882
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,360
And then I go look at what the framework does

883
00:38:48,879 --> 00:38:50,949
and there is basically no money in it,

884
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:55,570
no action in the framework, all of the action they will take that will be about

885
00:38:56,129 --> 00:38:58,419
providing the resources to deal with the work they

886
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,050
they will create to the maintenance.

887
00:39:01,409 --> 00:39:01,949
And

888
00:39:02,209 --> 00:39:05,439
I'm not saying that because the main thing is I want to make a ton of money.

889
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,070
I mean, I would love to work more on open source, right? But

890
00:39:08,189 --> 00:39:09,419
the reality is

891
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,870
at some point

892
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:14,750
if you need time and knowledge of particular specific

893
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,219
people and the rate is that for digital infrastructure,

894
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:21,909
we have a really small base of people that maintain it for everyone.

895
00:39:22,649 --> 00:39:23,340
And when, I mean, really

896
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,090
small, I mean, really

897
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:24,449
small.

898
00:39:24,459 --> 00:39:26,310
It's probably 10,000, it's probably already,

899
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,760
we probably have covered a lot of the bad

900
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:29,350
thing with 10,000 people.

901
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:33,370
You need to be able to give them the way to do their job.

902
00:39:34,219 --> 00:39:36,449
And right now, a lot of them do not.

903
00:39:36,899 --> 00:39:39,370
The example of lip curl come to my curl

904
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,479
for the first time

905
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,520
since the existence curl last year

906
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,679
was able to move

907
00:39:46,979 --> 00:39:48,250
their website o

908
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:48,689
thing

909
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:53,290
from something paid by the maintenance with his own money.

910
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:55,600
Wow,

911
00:39:55,889 --> 00:39:57,479
you make a whole blog post about it.

912
00:39:57,739 --> 00:40:00,699
That was the first time since the beginning of our channel that

913
00:40:00,709 --> 00:40:04,560
the curl project could pay for the sting of the website.

914
00:40:06,149 --> 00:40:08,959
Like we are not talking here of paying people

915
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:11,489
millions per year to do that job, right?

916
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,810
Like we don't even have the point where we can own the website

917
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,760
and it's come right. It's not a small randomly

918
00:40:17,909 --> 00:40:18,239
thing.

919
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,750
Like in my experience, that's the default is, you know,

920
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,370
pretty much every project is run at a loss like this podcast.

921
00:40:23,729 --> 00:40:26,429
And uh and I do love the whole, oh, we need more maintainers.

922
00:40:26,439 --> 00:40:28,399
And I'm like, how many maintainers do you think there are?

923
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:30,330
And they're like one per thing. I'm like, I got bad news for you.

924
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,719
It's actually less than one because there's a

925
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,979
whole bunch of maintainers with like 100 packages.

926
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,360
Oh, it's even better.

927
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,409
Have you ever heard of Auto?

928
00:40:37,229 --> 00:40:39,040
Yep. Right. It, it's kind of,

929
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:40,679
you know, a small thing. Right.

930
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:44,959
And not used, it's definitely not critical for a lot of soft

931
00:40:45,139 --> 00:40:45,310
that,

932
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,419
you know, legal thing. Right.

933
00:40:47,929 --> 00:40:49,479
Right. How many maintainers?

934
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:53,030
Uh, I would guess maybe the guy gets his cat to do it once in a while.

935
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:54,510
Ok. The real

936
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,159
zero since 2012.

937
00:40:56,489 --> 00:40:57,629
-- That
-- doesn't surprise me at all.

938
00:40:57,649 --> 00:40:58,139
Ok.

939
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:59,540
For anyone listening auto

940
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,639
is used by

941
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,139
everything,

942
00:41:03,979 --> 00:41:05,280
literally everything.

943
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,770
It managed a configuration and build compilation of

944
00:41:09,959 --> 00:41:11,610
basically everything on the planet,

945
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,449
not everything but a large portion of the sea could be

946
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,280
on the planet.

947
00:41:15,649 --> 00:41:17,330
It has no maintenance. It is 12

948
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,580
and it's not like it's complex, right?

949
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:25,419
Like it doesn't do anything complex, like nothing of the sense, it don't have bugs.

950
00:41:25,429 --> 00:41:28,139
I'm sure it has no bugs, like no problem there. Right.

951
00:41:28,189 --> 00:41:32,830
And there have been a release in 2020 or 21. I

952
00:41:32,959 --> 00:41:34,350
remember there was a new version of

953
00:41:34,469 --> 00:41:34,500
auto

954
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:36,379
come 3.14 if I

955
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:36,939
quickly,

956
00:41:37,689 --> 00:41:39,239
the reason it was done

957
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:44,189
is because Bloomberg paid one guy for six months

958
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:47,510
to go through all the patches that were sent to the mailing list

959
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,030
and release a new version.

960
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,590
And after six months,

961
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,229
they realized that one person for six months will not be enough to do that.

962
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,870
And so they paid two people for a year and a half to do a new version.

963
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:00,010
But that was a one time contract

964
00:42:00,189 --> 00:42:03,260
since then, there have been a bit of pick up in the auto

965
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,379
community trying to maintain it. But in practice, it's really hard.

966
00:42:06,389 --> 00:42:10,149
Not a lot of people have the knowledge, not of people because it's really arcane.

967
00:42:10,449 --> 00:42:12,899
Um not a lot of people have the knowledge all the time.

968
00:42:12,909 --> 00:42:15,070
So in reality, it's probably going to end up in the same place,

969
00:42:15,669 --> 00:42:16,229
but

970
00:42:16,399 --> 00:42:19,719
we are taking a decade without any maintenance for

971
00:42:19,729 --> 00:42:23,280
fundamental piece of infrastructure that is quite safety critical.

972
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:29,350
There actually is some activity starting late last year 2022.

973
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:31,995
But also a lot of it is literal like spell checks.

974
00:42:32,004 --> 00:42:35,854
There, there is some kind of deeper level changes that are,

975
00:42:35,864 --> 00:42:36,975
I'm looking at this one code, commit.

976
00:42:36,985 --> 00:42:41,784
It's actually a little scary but I mean, it's one person, this one person from UCL A.

977
00:42:41,955 --> 00:42:42,455
So yeah,

978
00:42:42,465 --> 00:42:44,784
I know you're clearly correct though like there there

979
00:42:44,794 --> 00:42:46,574
should be way more activity on this thing.

980
00:42:47,385 --> 00:42:51,604
-- We need to include the video of this show.
-- No one can see the gestures Tama is making.

981
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:54,520
Ok.

982
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,570
I want, I want to realist all the way back now because we are,

983
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:00,129
we've talked a lot about the problem.

984
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:05,879
How are we going to fix this? What like make me feel better after this conversation?

985
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:10,409
Ok. So I have a bad news. My nickname in some of these c

986
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:13,020
call about safety science is a cynical meson

987
00:43:13,729 --> 00:43:18,239
So, um I, I may not have a lot of good news otherwise I would not be called cynical.

988
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,320
I don't know.

989
00:43:19,659 --> 00:43:22,139
I have I DS like a lot of people will have I DS.

990
00:43:22,949 --> 00:43:23,399
Um

991
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:25,989
The reality is

992
00:43:26,919 --> 00:43:29,100
I don't see a way out

993
00:43:29,739 --> 00:43:31,300
in the current environment.

994
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,939
This is used everywhere

995
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:35,860
and this is fundamental like we cannot replace it easily.

996
00:43:36,149 --> 00:43:39,510
Like despite the example, I give all the time is open SSL, right?

997
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,919
Despite everyone try to focus on everything and to create new ones,

998
00:43:43,929 --> 00:43:45,129
performer and pros

999
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:46,689
IO and all that work, right?

1000
00:43:46,979 --> 00:43:52,129
We are still with Rus TLS and O like I looked recently into

1001
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:54,560
uh I'm part of the airline committee and I've,

1002
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:55,840
I have, it's a,

1003
00:43:55,969 --> 00:43:59,810
it's a virtual machine for the airline and Alex and all kind of languages.

1004
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:02,290
And I, I have some of my code in there

1005
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:07,090
and I was looking at can we get rid of open SSL because we linked to it?

1006
00:44:07,649 --> 00:44:10,060
And I wanted to get rid of it for, you know,

1007
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,889
classic security reasons. And I looked at what we use

1008
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:16,090
and the rating that we use in open SSL is also crypto

1009
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:20,060
primitives as far as I can tell there is nothing out there

1010
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:22,260
that even tried to solve that problem.

1011
00:44:22,989 --> 00:44:24,659
I mean, ring, ring

1012
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,729
in brass kind of try but in practice, it's a mess

1013
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:29,370
and we are not close to something that we

1014
00:44:29,379 --> 00:44:31,879
could use for something that's stable and that's used.

1015
00:44:31,889 --> 00:44:32,479
And So

1016
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,510
I, right now when I look at the reality of the world that things are used everywhere

1017
00:44:36,699 --> 00:44:38,159
and it works good enough,

1018
00:44:38,169 --> 00:44:40,669
it work good enough for us to continue like that for a long time.

1019
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:41,570
Probably

1020
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,310
other solution we could get. Probably, I would say that if we want,

1021
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,949
we could. So

1022
00:44:47,229 --> 00:44:49,679
I'm going to uh start with what we can do,

1023
00:44:49,689 --> 00:44:52,610
which I think we have an impact and then I can be a bit more, you know,

1024
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:54,199
air brain and invent things.

1025
00:44:54,439 --> 00:44:55,989
The thing I think we need to do

1026
00:44:56,149 --> 00:44:59,949
is to tell the story of, of digital infrastructure maintenance.

1027
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:04,379
We need to sit down and tell these stories.

1028
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,909
We need to change away the narrative we have

1029
00:45:08,489 --> 00:45:09,939
around digital infrastructure

1030
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,739
mostly because we don't have a narrative right now.

1031
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:14,870
The only narrative we have is when Google say

1032
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,659
you should put your name on things because we need to trust you.

1033
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:20,889
Yeah,

1034
00:45:21,169 --> 00:45:24,459
I am literally quoting from a blog post with pretty

1035
00:45:24,469 --> 00:45:27,360
big names of social engineering at Google on it.

1036
00:45:27,669 --> 00:45:31,479
I can find for you if you don't remember it. But that was literally a thing.

1037
00:45:31,489 --> 00:45:36,360
-- Oh, I, I remember reading it and I was just like, what? Like I
-- literally

1038
00:45:36,889 --> 00:45:39,639
-- yell at my screen
-- like they want to identify

1039
00:45:39,649 --> 00:45:42,669
uh they wanted identification requirements for open source maintainers.

1040
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:43,120
And I'm like,

1041
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:43,689
oh

1042
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,219
wow, that's,

1043
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:46,500
that's a big ask.

1044
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:51,590
I mean, it's not even a big ask. My my point is no, you don't have to trust us.

1045
00:45:51,959 --> 00:45:55,040
You have not trusted us for two decades and you have built everything on it.

1046
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:57,209
You don't need to trust us like, oh, put us away.

1047
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:00,179
What would us putting our name on it?

1048
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,209
Bring you,

1049
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:01,600
I,

1050
00:46:01,889 --> 00:46:04,550
I suspect it kind of boils back to that.

1051
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,689
The first story of, well, now we'll know who to blame and ask for a better decision.

1052
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:13,989
But you know what does not make people more secure liability.

1053
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:18,340
It allows you to blame someone but you don't stop the problem from happening.

1054
00:46:19,169 --> 00:46:23,239
So I I don't, so I think we need to tell the stories.

1055
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,189
We need to the Atlantic

1056
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:27,540
Council did a good job as a as a story

1057
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:31,959
oriented to um politicians like people that work in governments

1058
00:46:32,229 --> 00:46:35,909
and governance. And I think that was a good story and we need more of that.

1059
00:46:36,439 --> 00:46:39,050
The fact that I keep linking the Rod and Bridget

1060
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:44,510
Bridges report that was done in 2016 to a lot of people in digital manufactures

1061
00:46:44,959 --> 00:46:46,270
that have never read it.

1062
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,020
Despite the fact it was relatively big at the time, right? We talked about it.

1063
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:50,669
It was a follow up to

1064
00:46:50,889 --> 00:46:51,340
bleed and all

1065
00:46:51,989 --> 00:46:54,459
tell me that we are not telling the story well,

1066
00:46:54,469 --> 00:46:57,209
and we need to tell this these stories better,

1067
00:46:57,399 --> 00:47:00,209
right? People keep being surprised when they talk of auto

1068
00:47:00,379 --> 00:47:01,979
com or curl all that stuff.

1069
00:47:01,989 --> 00:47:05,340
We need to tell these stories because right now they are not told

1070
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:08,649
something we're also seeing with the CR A, right,

1071
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,280
the Cyber Residency Act in Europe right now

1072
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:16,169
is that it talks of open source and the way to open source is visible that

1073
00:47:16,179 --> 00:47:19,070
the people that wrote it do not know the reality of what we deal with.

1074
00:47:19,409 --> 00:47:22,600
And that's ok. Right. I'm not saying that they should have known it,

1075
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:27,080
-- but I'm saying that we as a committee need to tell these stories.
-- Yeah, absolutely.

1076
00:47:27,449 --> 00:47:30,610
That would be the first step. And the hope is that if we tell

1077
00:47:30,919 --> 00:47:33,270
this story and if we are able to make this narrative,

1078
00:47:33,379 --> 00:47:35,469
how people think about this a bit more,

1079
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:38,790
then solution would emerge. People, we do things to help.

1080
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,159
And when I say people, I mean, organizationally, right,

1081
00:47:41,169 --> 00:47:43,540
I don't be independent people that pay for sponsorship on github

1082
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:44,429
or stuff like that.

1083
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:46,669
So that's the first one.

1084
00:47:47,139 --> 00:47:50,030
Now, if I want to go deeper, realistically,

1085
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:55,409
we are going to need some kind of international governance on this. Sure,

1086
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:57,129
that may mean government,

1087
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:59,899
that may be not something else that may mean government.

1088
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,239
Um There are a few interesting initiatives

1089
00:48:03,439 --> 00:48:08,540
right now, I can think of. Uh one of them is the German government

1090
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:10,870
is doing a small pilot

1091
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,879
of giving grants to open source projects

1092
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:15,639
like fundamental one.

1093
00:48:15,879 --> 00:48:19,280
I think they call it the Sovereign Tech Fund or something like that.

1094
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:21,310
I can find you the link uh if you want.

1095
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:22,780
Um But

1096
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,050
yeah, sovereign

1097
00:48:24,179 --> 00:48:26,040
Tech fans, that's the name they use and,

1098
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,969
and the projects they are selected.

1099
00:48:27,979 --> 00:48:30,419
If you look at the projects that are selected,

1100
00:48:30,429 --> 00:48:33,629
they have an English page which shows that they understand something at least.

1101
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,659
And, but what you see the project is elected.

1102
00:48:37,979 --> 00:48:40,260
It's bundler and Ruby gem

1103
00:48:40,419 --> 00:48:44,959
P GP kernel, wireguard, open ssh, open B GP D A

1104
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:46,850
fortune packet manger.

1105
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,340
Like these are sensible choice for this kind of gras that

1106
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,129
when we want maintenance.

1107
00:48:53,469 --> 00:48:57,780
-- And I think something like this, this is a pilot. It's relatively small.
-- Sorry.

1108
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:00,149
I there's also the FORTRAN package manager on

1109
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:02,270
that list which I love because that like,

1110
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,739
I'm sorry, folks, there's some boring stuff we need to fix.

1111
00:49:05,159 --> 00:49:06,459
Yes. Right.

1112
00:49:06,489 --> 00:49:10,909
And it's important like something I put out a few times we talk about all this

1113
00:49:10,919 --> 00:49:14,780
work we need to do to get uh green energy and all the climate general.

1114
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:18,409
What language do you think all your simulation and

1115
00:49:18,419 --> 00:49:21,500
work run on for the impact of climate change?

1116
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:23,719
Now,

1117
00:49:23,729 --> 00:49:26,810
imagine what happened if there is a massive floating point

1118
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:30,070
handling error there that is creeping only one every 10

1119
00:49:30,199 --> 00:49:33,949
computation and we have no idea and no one knows how to handle this.

1120
00:49:33,959 --> 00:49:37,270
I think government impact some kind of taxation or something like

1121
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,189
that will probably be part of the answer at some point.

1122
00:49:40,709 --> 00:49:41,409
Uh There is a

1123
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:44,649
hard discussion we need to have in open source communities

1124
00:49:44,659 --> 00:49:47,389
around the fact that this goes contrary to the ethos,

1125
00:49:47,399 --> 00:49:50,790
we have talked about for a long time because we are not just

1126
00:49:50,929 --> 00:49:52,090
fighting

1127
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:54,260
Microsoft to publish a noise

1128
00:49:54,459 --> 00:49:57,370
that some people can toy with and use a printer with.

1129
00:49:57,850 --> 00:49:59,550
We are running the world

1130
00:49:59,709 --> 00:50:01,250
and people life depend on us.

1131
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:04,510
And so at some point, we may have to grow up and realize that this is

1132
00:50:04,629 --> 00:50:07,100
a way to what we deal with. The maintenance, knows that,

1133
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,060
right, the local for

1134
00:50:08,209 --> 00:50:10,770
Jay people that dealt with all that time, know that.

1135
00:50:11,149 --> 00:50:13,810
But the ethos and the way we talk of it in the committee is

1136
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:16,100
not there yet and that's something we probably need to talk to us.

1137
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:17,709
So if you want to see change

1138
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:19,899
and the final thing I would say,

1139
00:50:19,909 --> 00:50:23,469
and I will close on this is we could and that's me totally.

1140
00:50:23,479 --> 00:50:26,189
That's not what I would advise, but that's something I'm bringing up.

1141
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:30,070
If we want this to be visible, we could just all decide to walk off.

1142
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:31,810
So

1143
00:50:31,919 --> 00:50:35,280
all open source committee, uh maintenance committee decide, you know what for you.

1144
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:37,090
We are not going to publish any update,

1145
00:50:37,209 --> 00:50:37,959
deal with it.

1146
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,919
-- A
-- year. Society would collapse in a week.

1147
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:43,820
But, you know,

1148
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:44,699
deal with it.

1149
00:50:44,929 --> 00:50:46,179
Yeah, fork it and fix it.

1150
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,540
I mean, no one can do that because for

1151
00:50:48,669 --> 00:50:50,169
it and fix it needs that you need to be able to

1152
00:50:50,179 --> 00:50:52,530
have the knowledge we talked about and you don't have that right?

1153
00:50:52,729 --> 00:50:53,239
So,

1154
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:54,310
but, and,

1155
00:50:54,419 --> 00:50:58,459
and, and, and that we are not there yet and I doubt we will get there any time soon.

1156
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:03,860
But at some point, if you want to make the problem visible, which is our prime here,

1157
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:04,179
right?

1158
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,540
Because the prime is not visible because it works nearly all the time.

1159
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:11,750
We may have to try to organize these kind of actions.

1160
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:12,830
Toma,

1161
00:51:13,179 --> 00:51:16,989
I feel like I've been drinking from the fire hose and holy cow.

1162
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,389
You've given me so much to think about it. I thank you. Thank you so much for your time.

1163
00:51:21,399 --> 00:51:22,110
This has been

1164
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:23,149
amazing.

1165
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,770
I'm available, uh, any time and I get told that a lot

1166
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:32,270
and I, I feel like we scratch a service. I want to Kurt and Tama.

1167
00:51:32,399 --> 00:51:33,909
Thank you so much.

1168
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:34,510
Have

1169
00:51:34,629 --> 00:51:38,070
a, oh, wait, I have to do the, the exit of the show first. I, I forget that sometimes.

1170
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,739
All right, so, so thank you, Kurt. Thank you, Tama.

1171
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:41,949
Thank you for listening.

1172
00:51:41,959 --> 00:51:44,860
I will put all the show notes at open source security podcast.com. You can use the

1173
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,550
Podos podcast hashtag

1174
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,590
to find us on social media. Kurt and Tama

1175
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,709
-- have a marvelous rest of your
-- day.

1176
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:54,719
-- Thank you. Have a good day. Thank
-- you, everybody. Thanks everyone. Bye bye.
