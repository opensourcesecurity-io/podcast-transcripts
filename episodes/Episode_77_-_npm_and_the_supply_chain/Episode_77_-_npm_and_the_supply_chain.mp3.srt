Hello and welcome to the open source Security podcast episode 77 with myself,

1
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:11,460
Kurt Siegfried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,229
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,529 --> 00:00:14,060
What's New Kurt?

4
00:00:14,479 --> 00:00:16,079
Uh, we're finally getting some snow.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,809
Finally. You live in, like the north of the Arctic Circle and you haven't had snow.

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:22,690
We've had,

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,770
we had a little bit of snow early on in the year and then

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,129
we had a little bit of snow a few weeks ago and it,

9
00:00:28,139 --> 00:00:29,149
it got warm

10
00:00:29,299 --> 00:00:32,889
and so my front lawn was actually, I would say maybe only two thirds covered in snow.

11
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,529
And then there was that really terrible brown looking grass.

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,880
And you've told me all the skiing you've done though,

13
00:00:38,889 --> 00:00:41,619
I assume your ski hills have the magic snow machines.

14
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:42,540
Yes.

15
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,869
Well, I mean, Snow Valley is literally inside the city. It's a 15 minute drive away.

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,380
And so

17
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,080
you can actually take a bus there if you want.

18
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,549
So if, if they're in the city and they make snow,

19
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,520
do they accidentally like it snow on someone's sidewalk if

20
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:57,720
they're in a valley,

21
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:58,970
I suppose,

22
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,119
hence

23
00:00:59,240 --> 00:00:59,330
the

24
00:00:59,430 --> 00:00:59,669
name?

25
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:00,169
Yeah,

26
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:00,840
exactly.

27
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:01,880
Yeah, I know. Hey,

28
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:02,919
um, yeah.

29
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,610
And, well, the trick with snow making those,

30
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,760
it has to be below a certain temperature and they

31
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:08,959
usually make snow at night because it's colder then.

32
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,290
Um, and so we were lucky because this year we had essentially,

33
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,879
we had very early snow for about a week

34
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,230
and then we had a cold snap of like, minus 1020 degrees for about 23 weeks.

35
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,709
I assume this is Celsius, the gentleman's temperature scale.

36
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:24,540
Ok.

37
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:30,010
-- The, the one that all of the world uses except for America,
-- except for that one place.

38
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,099
Yeah. Yeah.

39
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:35,470
Uh, but, uh, yeah, so they, they were able to make a ton of snow early in the season.

40
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,779
So we've been going skiing, like, 23 times a week

41
00:01:38,169 --> 00:01:39,400
for a couple of months now.

42
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:40,660
Yeah, it's awesome.

43
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,250
But, uh, yeah.

44
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:42,910
No, it's, uh,

45
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:46,650
it's winter and it's funny though because we had a cold snap and everyone was like,

46
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,620
oh, my God, why is it so cold?

47
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:48,169
And I'm like,

48
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,279
it's the first week of January.

49
00:01:50,809 --> 00:01:51,669
Like, that's,

50
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:52,790
that's normal.

51
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:54,610
That's

52
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:55,430
what

53
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,699
I don't understand the question.

54
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:58,669
Warming.

55
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,750
I know.

56
00:02:00,419 --> 00:02:01,099
But, uh,

57
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:06,720
yeah, so, well, I mean, I guess this week's latest kerfuffle is the whole, no Js.

58
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:09,279
Yeah, this one's really good

59
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,130
actually.

60
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:10,610
Well, there's,

61
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:16,529
there's kind of two stories I really like on this one is there was the issue of I, it's,

62
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:18,889
what is it left pad this time or something?

63
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,289
Well, it was kick and then left pad.

64
00:02:21,429 --> 00:02:22,830
-- Ok.
-- And that was,

65
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:24,570
that was a few months ago

66
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:25,380
when that

67
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:25,610
happened.

68
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:27,130
Ok.

69
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,449
Kick was this one.

70
00:02:28,929 --> 00:02:30,750
No kick led to left pad

71
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,750
and it's just being brought up again because there was

72
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,610
ok. So yeah, there was, there

73
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:37,100
was the original kerfuffle.

74
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:37,729
Ok.

75
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,300
So the two main things are uh so no Js is uh well, no Js

76
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,960
and like many modern things,

77
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,589
it has a packaging system so that you can like go grab a package that, you know,

78
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,070
converts dates or

79
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:56,470
whatever, uh changes the font color of your log files, whatever.

80
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,559
And there was a developer who had a package called Kkik

81
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,860
and there was a company called Kick

82
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,250
and they exchanged some emails apparently and

83
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:09,199
essentially they couldn't come to an agreement.

84
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:13,119
So the company went to the uh N PM people and under their

85
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:14,729
sort of package name, dispute

86
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,960
resolution process,

87
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,509
they booted the developer with Kik off and let

88
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,270
the company take over the name of that package.

89
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:22,210
So essentially they

90
00:03:22,589 --> 00:03:24,820
N PM controls the name space for

91
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,800
N PM.

92
00:03:26,259 --> 00:03:29,520
And that's important because like when you, you know, node install

93
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:34,320
blank, you're getting whatever it is they send you right. Hopefully it's

94
00:03:34,529 --> 00:03:35,919
what you expect.

95
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,199
Um

96
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,440
So basically this developer, I guess, didn't really appreciate that.

97
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:43,000
So they deleted

98
00:03:43,529 --> 00:03:46,839
all of their packages off of N PM and they had one package called left pad,

99
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,800
which basically like literally,

100
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:49,919
oh

101
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,619
like straight up, just

102
00:03:54,619 --> 00:03:56,449
left pads, text,

103
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,330
right, just like what was it was right shift was the last one.

104
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:00,669
Right.

105
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,669
It's like,

106
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:02,089
yeah.

107
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,330
And so it was used and depended on by,

108
00:04:06,339 --> 00:04:08,889
by thousands or hundreds or thousands or whatever of,

109
00:04:08,899 --> 00:04:11,720
of other N PM packages which then all failed.

110
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:12,970
Well,

111
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,460
and the other thing to remember too is

112
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,350
in any sort of packaging ecosystem.

113
00:04:18,369 --> 00:04:22,010
It's turtles all the way down because everything depends on everything.

114
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:22,880
Eventually.

115
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:24,250
I wonder

116
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:28,720
-- if we've gotten to the point of circular dependencies.
-- I guarantee they exist.

117
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,239
I guarantee they exist. Well, I remember writing dependency

118
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,320
uh algorithms

119
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:37,679
along. I don't remember why I even did. Oh no, that's right.

120
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,029
I, I worked for a company called Progeny Linux systems like a million years ago.

121
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,769
And one of the things we were doing

122
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:46,149
was trying to build like customizable Linux distributions.

123
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,790
And so obviously a package dependencies. It was, it was crazy, man.

124
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:55,540
This was back in like 04, maybe 02. I mean, it was, it was a cool idea back then, right?

125
00:04:55,549 --> 00:04:57,850
And the answer ended up being containers but

126
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:58,760
ignoring

127
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,679
the answer ended up being jam it all until

128
00:05:02,505 --> 00:05:02,554
straight

129
00:05:02,904 --> 00:05:03,114
up, just

130
00:05:03,265 --> 00:05:03,545
keep adding.

131
00:05:04,015 --> 00:05:05,635
And I, I remember writing

132
00:05:05,765 --> 00:05:07,265
something that would kind of go through all

133
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:10,165
the dependencies and figure all this stuff out because

134
00:05:10,295 --> 00:05:10,864
yeah, it was,

135
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,994
you'd end up with things like circular dependencies

136
00:05:13,005 --> 00:05:15,315
and you'd have to make sure certain things

137
00:05:15,424 --> 00:05:18,125
depended on certain other things in certain ways and,

138
00:05:18,135 --> 00:05:20,755
and things got crazy out of hand doing this.

139
00:05:20,765 --> 00:05:23,404
And I, I remember that, that was actually really fun work,

140
00:05:24,059 --> 00:05:26,440
but it was ultimately unsuccessful.

141
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:29,760
Yeah. So anyways, it's

142
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:33,510
so that's the first kind of story about the N PM.

143
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:36,070
And this has also happened with lots of other, you know,

144
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:36,950
um

145
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,089
package systems like uh Ruby gems.org is a good example.

146
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,899
Ruby gems.org is sort of the Ruby Gems package or

147
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,869
that or site that won the Ruby Gems Wars.

148
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,029
Uh There were actually sort of three main ones to begin with.

149
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,339
And so you essentially had three separate name spaces.

150
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:53,640
And so for example,

151
00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:57,630
there were packages that were like had the same name across three name spaces,

152
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,220
but were controlled by different people,

153
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:00,220
you know. So,

154
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:04,380
so yeah, exactly like and, and some of these were pretty clearly, you know,

155
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,890
not super good guys.

156
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:09,859
Um I think one of the names that was squatted on was like the B zip two package.

157
00:06:10,549 --> 00:06:11,170
Um

158
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,690
because something to remember is, I mean,

159
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:15,970
let's, let's how do I put this nicely,

160
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:19,109
the majority of developer developers, especially in the DEV

161
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,290
ops Agile World,

162
00:06:20,869 --> 00:06:23,260
they write a bunch of code with a bunch of, you know,

163
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:25,649
import or depends or whatever statements

164
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,779
and they don't audit that code

165
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,380
and they don't audit the code that that code pulls in and so on and so on and circular.

166
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,529
And I mean, quite literally,

167
00:06:35,869 --> 00:06:38,529
it's quite common for something like a note Js

168
00:06:39,369 --> 00:06:41,470
application to then pull in dependencies which

169
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,260
pull in dependencies which you end up with

170
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,109
easily over 100 megabytes of, you know, Min

171
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,549
javascript,

172
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,559
which is literally enough javascript to, like, you know,

173
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,799
build an airline reservation system,

174
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,739
like straight up.

175
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,140
-- That's a great comparison.
-- Right.

176
00:06:59,149 --> 00:06:59,619
Basically,

177
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,260
it's so much code that nobody will ever be able to

178
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:04,029
audit it and actually determine what it does or doesn't do.

179
00:07:04,179 --> 00:07:05,890
You know, and the system runs on trust and,

180
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,899
and, and it mostly works. It's, it's ok.

181
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:12,660
Right. You know, people find flaws, we squash the flaws and there's luckily

182
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:16,779
there don't seem to be many bad actors getting involved in this probably because,

183
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,209
uh,

184
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,899
-- well, I don't know why because it is quite,
-- I have

185
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,679
some thoughts actually. And, and this is, there was a

186
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:26,670
story someone wrote

187
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,089
and the title, let me, let me pull the title up here.

188
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:34,799
It's titled I'm Harvesting credit card numbers and passwords from your site.

189
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:35,700
Here's how,

190
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,779
and this guy kind of laid out

191
00:07:38,109 --> 00:07:40,420
if he was going to say abuse

192
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,420
node

193
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,019
and have a malicious package that was

194
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:46,100
stealing information off of people's websites,

195
00:07:46,109 --> 00:07:47,260
kind of what he would do.

196
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,700
And I started reading this

197
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:53,059
and I was thinking this is extremely plausible

198
00:07:53,429 --> 00:07:53,809
and then

199
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,029
I think,

200
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:57,299
and, and no, no, here's, I, I don't think it is anymore.

201
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:59,929
I, I put a lot of thought into this and, and I think

202
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:04,850
this sounds like something that, that will work in a very short term.

203
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,489
But you have to remember. This is the long game we're talking about here. Right.

204
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:09,329
And,

205
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,790
and the thing is you only have to get caught once I

206
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:16,329
view this as kind of like the reverse blue team problem where

207
00:08:16,549 --> 00:08:20,890
the blue team has to succeed. Every time the red team only has to succeed. Once

208
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,929
in a situation like this,

209
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:28,160
you have to stay undetected forever once you're detected, once

210
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,760
it's game over

211
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,170
ever. But

212
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,539
I mean, for example, let's say the guy,

213
00:08:34,558 --> 00:08:37,020
So the premise of the article was this guy wrote

214
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,989
a uh N PM package that uh actually yeah,

215
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,719
changed the font color of your log files to make him pretty

216
00:08:44,739 --> 00:08:47,510
and then also harvested credit card numbers, you know,

217
00:08:47,859 --> 00:08:49,700
and they had some tricks like only harvesting credit

218
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,159
card numbers between like 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. and

219
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,179
um you know,

220
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,869
trying to do it intelligently so that if you were

221
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,770
using like square or things with like good security,

222
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,359
it wouldn't, you know, get in the way of that and kind of block it.

223
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,859
And here's the thing.

224
00:09:02,869 --> 00:09:04,780
I mean, it takes a lot of work up front,

225
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:06,840
which probably is why a lot of Attackers aren't

226
00:09:06,849 --> 00:09:08,400
doing it because Attackers are going for like,

227
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:10,200
I want to break into a website in half an hour,

228
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:13,299
harvest a pile of credit card numbers and sell them online, right?

229
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:14,539
Not,

230
00:09:14,549 --> 00:09:16,650
I want to invest six months building up this long

231
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:18,690
con and then harvest a pile of credit card numbers.

232
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,880
Right? I, I think that's part of it. Yes.

233
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,909
And, and not only that though,

234
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:24,679
so here's

235
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,919
what I keep thinking about is

236
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,179
you do this

237
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,979
and you'll be successful for a little while.

238
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:34,640
But like all these mitigations, this guy talked about

239
00:09:35,349 --> 00:09:39,169
those mitigations might work at 80% of organizations,

240
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:40,750
but they're not going to work at 100.

241
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,010
Right. And again, you only have to get caught once and the con is up.

242
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:46,679
True.

243
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:47,719
But the question is like,

244
00:09:47,729 --> 00:09:50,710
does the con go on long enough to harvest a big pile of credit cards?

245
00:09:50,719 --> 00:09:51,369
-- And, and
-- I,

246
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,880
yes, it certainly could.

247
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,760
I think if you actually started this,

248
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:57,179
you could probably get thousands or hundreds

249
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,599
of thousands of numbers before you're caught.

250
00:09:59,929 --> 00:10:04,080
But kind of the point being and, and the thing I keep thinking of is

251
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:09,799
I would be surprised if you could get away with this for more than 3 to 6 months,

252
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,969
maybe a year if you're lucky.

253
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:12,700
And now,

254
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,570
granted, that's a super long time. I'm not saying it isn't,

255
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:17,640
but you're gonna get caught.

256
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,000
And that's what tells me the fact that we haven't heard about this

257
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:25,169
before suggests to me no one's done it because you're gonna get found.

258
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:28,039
You're not going to be able to do this 100%. Right.

259
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:29,849
Well,

260
00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:33,280
there have been modules that were leaking

261
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:35,650
information or exposing information and then it's,

262
00:10:35,659 --> 00:10:36,500
the question is, well,

263
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,450
is this a malicious piece of code or just really poor programming?

264
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,479
Right. And and

265
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:41,679
that, I

266
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,010
think we could debate for days.

267
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,059
You know, I, I'm totally willing to

268
00:10:46,349 --> 00:10:46,369
go

269
00:10:46,469 --> 00:10:46,570
with

270
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:47,309
Hanlon's

271
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:48,380
Razor on this one.

272
00:10:48,609 --> 00:10:52,799
Yeah, I kind of agree. I think it's, it's often silly mistakes

273
00:10:53,299 --> 00:10:54,200
but, but

274
00:10:54,349 --> 00:10:56,340
like this story here is,

275
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,919
it is hugely complex and, and I think

276
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,369
this also makes me think of like movie, movie Theft

277
00:11:04,469 --> 00:11:05,119
where

278
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:11,659
you, you look at movie plots and the bad guys have these insanely elaborate plans

279
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,679
and it's like in real life,

280
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,440
you could never do that

281
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:21,200
-- in real life. If your plan has more than two steps, you're going to fail.
-- Right?

282
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,390
Well, part of it too is this, this is one of those things where

283
00:11:24,619 --> 00:11:27,039
you need a lot of domain specific knowledge

284
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:28,440
to even

285
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,760
interact with the systems, let alone interact with them in a malicious way,

286
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:33,760
right?

287
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,950
You know, he gives the example of, I mean, first of all,

288
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,359
you'd have to be able to write some useful, no Js code.

289
00:11:38,369 --> 00:11:42,690
OK? That right there raises the bar of it, then you'd have to publish it to N PM. OK?

290
00:11:42,739 --> 00:11:44,900
Then you'd have to convince other people to embed it.

291
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,565
Then you'd have to do, you know,

292
00:11:46,765 --> 00:11:50,135
um or you'd have to make a lot of other fake projects that embedded,

293
00:11:50,145 --> 00:11:52,094
to make it look real, you'd have to make a pile of github

294
00:11:52,215 --> 00:11:53,395
accounts that look real.

295
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:54,525
You'd have to, you know,

296
00:11:54,794 --> 00:11:58,614
you and granted, you know, if you wrote some tooling around this to automate it,

297
00:11:58,625 --> 00:11:59,945
then you only have to do that once.

298
00:11:59,955 --> 00:12:03,895
But again, even, you know, that is a level of sophistication and expertise that,

299
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,820
yeah, probably not a lot of Attackers have or if they do have it, you know,

300
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,929
they're going to use it for slightly more targeted and direct attacks.

301
00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:11,950
Um,

302
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,020
this kind of reminds me of that whole, it's like spam in a way and that, you know,

303
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,979
rather than these targeted attacks

304
00:12:18,229 --> 00:12:22,469
that we focus on a lot, these kind of spam level attacks where I'm just gonna like,

305
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:25,840
slam everybody and, yeah, like 99% of people will just block it out.

306
00:12:25,849 --> 00:12:28,630
Right. But 1% might be stupid enough to fall for it and like,

307
00:12:29,179 --> 00:12:32,099
you know, believe that the Nigerian Princes need your credit card number.

308
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:35,539
Um, and I kind of wonder if we're also approaching that

309
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,010
security era as it were because,

310
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,609
you know, these targeted attacks definitely work. Um,

311
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,750
but I mean,

312
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:48,469
they, you know, they take, they take a lot of personal effort

313
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:50,349
and if, you know,

314
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,950
if I, if you tell an attacker, hey, here's a tool.

315
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,309
It'll automatically attack 1000 websites and, you know,

316
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,289
one of them will be vulnerable and you'll get credit

317
00:12:57,299 --> 00:12:59,030
card numbers and you just run it for an hour.

318
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,159
Yeah, they'll probably start doing that.

319
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,219
-- All
-- right. Yeah,

320
00:13:02,969 --> 00:13:04,239
I, I think you might be right.

321
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,150
And, and not only that, speaking of Nigerian Princes,

322
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:11,219
I remember reading an interview with one of those scammers once

323
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:15,469
and someone asked, like, why, why is your spelling so bad?

324
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,989
And, and like, why are these stories so ridiculous? And he said,

325
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,289
you have to make it as over the top

326
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:25,320
as possible because that way you know anyone who replies

327
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,250
is you've got them right?

328
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,880
Because these aren't people who,

329
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:33,309
who probably have a firm grasp on what's going on around them necessarily.

330
00:13:34,219 --> 00:13:35,840
It reminds me of three card Monty.

331
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:39,299
If you don't know that somebody on the street doing three card Monty is a scam,

332
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,119
then OK, you're the mark.

333
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,510
Yes, that's exactly right.

334
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:50,880
You know how, how anybody thinks they can win a three card Monte on the street.

335
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,150
Uh No, but the guy before me won. So,

336
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:58,690
but the guy before me just won. So I know I can because I'm smarter than him.

337
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,190
Oh, man, I know

338
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,219
you was funny about that is I was, I was at,

339
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:10,840
I was, there's this touristy trap in Wisconsin called Wisconsin Dells.

340
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,849
And right, it's all full of water parks and it is a nice place.

341
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,900
And we were, there was a street magician there and the guy was like, hey,

342
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:18,559
you guys got to come here and do this and I,

343
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,580
I literally kept my hand in my pocket on my

344
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:23,700
wallet the entire time he was doing his magic.

345
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:26,219
I'm like, this dude's gonna steal my wallet

346
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,580
and I'm not gonna know it.

347
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,729
-- And like I, the things he did
-- did you

348
00:14:29,979 --> 00:14:30,650
check for your phone.

349
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:34,700
Uh, I did not. That was in my other pocket and

350
00:14:35,109 --> 00:14:38,669
I admit I was slightly less concerned about. Oh, here's the thing though.

351
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,690
The street magicians never steal someone's cell phone, right?

352
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,760
They always steal the wallet,

353
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,349
right. Like that's the, that's the gimmick.

354
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:45,510
And so

355
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,739
I, in fact, now that you say it,

356
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,940
I think a street magician stealing your cell phone would be very cool.

357
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:53,580
But no, it's always the wallet, man. You should know that.

358
00:14:54,369 --> 00:14:55,549
So, anyway, and, and,

359
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,340
and, yeah, the crap this guy did, it was like, I,

360
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:03,000
people are terrible at dealing with hucksters like this. Right.

361
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:05,659
And the guy was great. Right. He gave everyone all their stuff back.

362
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:09,789
He stole from him. But it's like, holy crap if this guy wanted to be.

363
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:11,419
Although I guess that's part of the story. Right.

364
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,419
That guy could become a pickpocket and he would probably do, ok.

365
00:15:15,429 --> 00:15:16,210
But I get, he's, I,

366
00:15:16,219 --> 00:15:20,489
I bet he makes way more money as a street magician than he would stealing from people.

367
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,900
Not counting the fact that he's probably going

368
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:22,440
to jail.

369
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,590
Right. Exactly. Exactly.

370
00:15:24,599 --> 00:15:27,130
I mean, heck, I gave him like, 20 bucks because my kids were just, like,

371
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,239
enthralled by this show.

372
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:28,630
Right.

373
00:15:28,849 --> 00:15:30,390
Whereas had he stole my wallet,

374
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,900
he would have made about 25 bucks. Right.

375
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:33,869
That's,

376
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,510
that's what it would have been. You never have cash.

377
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:37,880
Yeah.

378
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,049
Yeah. No, this, uh, going back to the N PM. Thing.

379
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:45,650
Uh, part of what really sort of scares me in a way is that

380
00:15:46,309 --> 00:15:50,159
we have these systems where people own a name space

381
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,710
that is globally used

382
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,840
and, and all of a sudden becomes very important, uh,

383
00:15:56,849 --> 00:16:00,320
like a great example of this is like, Yelp.

384
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:04,880
Yelp owns the kind of Yelp wants to own the name space of all businesses

385
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:09,679
and, you know, well, it'd be a shame if your business got a bad rating on Yelp.

386
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,919
But hey, you can pay us to get, you know,

387
00:16:11,969 --> 00:16:15,169
those bad ratings suppressed or the good ratings on top or whatever, right.

388
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:17,070
You know, same thing like Google

389
00:16:17,219 --> 00:16:18,400
to put it bluntly,

390
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,510
I don't go to restaurants that score below four on Google Maps.

391
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:23,750
I

392
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,239
just straight up, don't,

393
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,010
I totally get it.

394
00:16:27,409 --> 00:16:29,580
And like, quite frankly, Google could,

395
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,880
you know, more and more people are going to be doing this, I assume because

396
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:35,289
I, I'm at a point in my life where it's like, wait a second,

397
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:37,380
there's like a ton of really good restaurants.

398
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:40,440
Why would I go to this one with like a 3.2 rating where

399
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:43,539
people are saying that like the staff is surly and the food is cold

400
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,070
like that. Why, why would I even, you know, bother

401
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:50,239
looking at the restaurant, let alone going there to eat right now. I

402
00:16:50,349 --> 00:16:55,229
don't let me ask this in the context of Saint Node package managers.

403
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:57,309
Is there a way to rate

404
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:58,650
the packages

405
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,710
Well, see, and that's sort of, uh,

406
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:03,809
one of the things with a lot of these name spaces is

407
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,910
they don't really do that or it's sort of implied rating by,

408
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,500
you know, how many people use it

409
00:17:08,719 --> 00:17:09,500
or, like on github,

410
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:12,380
you know, how many people are starred? This, how many people are watching it?

411
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,630
How many people have forked it?

412
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:18,719
Right. Yes, I do. And I use that kind of as a metric when I'm looking at code

413
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,848
to kind of see, you know, like,

414
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:24,348
oh, this code has like, you know, 2000 people watching it. Ok?

415
00:17:24,358 --> 00:17:27,449
It's, yeah, it's probably somewhat legit versus like, oh,

416
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:29,290
this code has nobody starring it.

417
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,380
Nobody watching it, nobody has forked it.

418
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:33,369
Nobody cares about this code,

419
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:35,290
you know.

420
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,150
Um

421
00:17:37,709 --> 00:17:38,790
And, but the thing is these,

422
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:44,439
these control of the name space is incredibly powerful because in most cases,

423
00:17:45,109 --> 00:17:48,130
it's very opaque in the sense of like you can

424
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,829
do whatever you want and nobody has any recourse,

425
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:51,420
right?

426
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,050
Um

427
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:53,810
You know, like

428
00:17:54,219 --> 00:17:58,849
uh some name spaces have very official policy and rules like for example,

429
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:00,770
DNS the domain name system, right?

430
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:04,969
You know, if I register something.com and there's a company with that, you know,

431
00:18:04,979 --> 00:18:06,699
they can come after me and there's a bunch of laws

432
00:18:06,709 --> 00:18:08,489
they can use to recover that domain name and it's,

433
00:18:08,979 --> 00:18:12,329
you know, there's at least some laws and process that are documented, but

434
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:16,650
you look at things like say N PM and looking at the name space policy.

435
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,920
I'm not really clear why

436
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,920
the company Kik man, you know, got

437
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:24,719
was allowed to grab this package name away

438
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,630
from the developer who originally built it.

439
00:18:27,569 --> 00:18:32,630
-- I mean, if there's a trademark, the
-- blog entry kind of reads like BS,

440
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:36,010
well, the blog entry might be and they're not lawyers, but I mean,

441
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:39,229
you can make legitimate trademark claims against things like that.

442
00:18:39,239 --> 00:18:40,939
I mean, if you're a company named Kik the

443
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:42,589
software,

444
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:47,430
but the problem with trademarks is that trademarks are quite often just local.

445
00:18:47,589 --> 00:18:50,650
So for example, what happens when you have three different K companies,

446
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,469
one in Canada, one in Uzbekistan and one in Australia,

447
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:58,060
it's going to fall to probably let's face it,

448
00:18:58,069 --> 00:19:01,260
the American company because I assume that's where,

449
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:05,300
where much of this silliness often happens and where many of these people live

450
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,030
and, and look,

451
00:19:06,569 --> 00:19:11,140
I'm not gonna piss off the local, whoever in my country, right?

452
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,479
They're the ones I care about like, yeah, Canada is great and all, but

453
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,280
I'm not worried about them. I don't know.

454
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,229
-- Yeah,
-- exactly.

455
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:18,839
And see, that's the thing about,

456
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:22,760
that's the problem with names spaces is up until recently, the world

457
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:26,599
didn't have global name spaces, right? You,

458
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,689
you generally didn't worry about Bob's Deli

459
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:34,170
in Australia having the same name as Bob. Bob's Deli down the road,

460
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:38,060
you know, but now that's a problem with these, especially with these, you know,

461
00:19:38,069 --> 00:19:39,859
single name spaces like

462
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,189
N PM or CPA

463
00:19:42,369 --> 00:19:45,579
or Ruby Jams, you know where it is global in nature.

464
00:19:46,339 --> 00:19:49,760
And then there, you know, for example, you have nouns like Amazon.

465
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,420
Amazon is just a well known place name and it's also a large company.

466
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,239
It used to be a well known place name.

467
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,500
Now it's a company.

468
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:58,579
Yeah,

469
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,829
you know, and so like for example, Square,

470
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:03,050
right?

471
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,540
That's a big payment processor. But you know, it's also the word square.

472
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:12,930
And what if I write a package called square that like

473
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,569
measures the space?

474
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:16,599
I don't know, it does something with squares,

475
00:20:16,609 --> 00:20:19,130
geographic or geometrically speaking, I don't know,

476
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:19,969
you know,

477
00:20:19,979 --> 00:20:21,810
should square have the right to take that away

478
00:20:21,819 --> 00:20:23,579
from me because they have the trademark on Square.

479
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:24,109
Well,

480
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:25,609
yeah, exactly. Whereas

481
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,609
the name space control and where's the lawyers and all that. But

482
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,160
-- I,
-- I think we should say the

483
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,089
other thing is the open

484
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:32,890
source legal podcast.

485
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,790
But, but the really ugly problem here is that

486
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:39,810
most people use these name spaces without thinking about it at all.

487
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:40,849
Right.

488
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:41,369
So

489
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,449
these people all pulling in left pad, for example, and

490
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,510
it disappears one day and all their apps all break, right?

491
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,650
And I mean, well, I used to work for Red Hat and I still do and this is why Red Hat,

492
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,209
for example,

493
00:20:51,219 --> 00:20:55,410
we take software and we package it and we package it in a way so that there's no

494
00:20:55,869 --> 00:20:56,489
um

495
00:20:56,829 --> 00:21:00,619
like external dependencies, you know, when we install an R PM on your system.

496
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,109
It's not like, oh, I gotta go

497
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:05,089
off to some random website and grab a bunch of stuff.

498
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:06,310
Right.

499
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:06,540
And,

500
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:12,260
and I think that is still completely valid and I think if you're operating in

501
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:15,020
an environment where you don't keep copies of

502
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,380
the artifacts you're putting in your products,

503
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,310
you're going to have a bad day.

504
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,930
Well, yeah, for, and the other aspect too is if that,

505
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:26,150
you know, if it goes away, you're boned and or if it changes.

506
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,910
Yeah. Can you revert to a known good copy?

507
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,140
Like if somebody hacks a developer account and then puts malicious code,

508
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:34,270
not even hack a developer account, man.

509
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:34,619
I mean,

510
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:39,099
how many of these projects don't have breaking changes between versions where you,

511
00:21:39,109 --> 00:21:39,520
you just

512
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,250
upgrade to a new version? I mean,

513
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,689
it's super common

514
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,199
and,

515
00:21:44,209 --> 00:21:46,390
and now we've made it to a supply chain

516
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,209
argument which is totally where this was headed anyway.

517
00:21:49,469 --> 00:21:50,609
And, and yeah, I mean,

518
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:52,250
this is one of the things I,

519
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,770
I deal with this constantly every day and I think

520
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,489
about it all the time is the fact that,

521
00:21:56,959 --> 00:21:59,310
you know, there is an open source supply chain

522
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,280
and

523
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,699
we aren't doing a good job of,

524
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,300
of dealing with it.

525
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:06,459
Like there's some companies like Red Hat is,

526
00:22:06,469 --> 00:22:09,180
is in honestly the poster child for doing it right.

527
00:22:09,189 --> 00:22:12,770
And, and I look at a lot of places that are doing it horribly wrong

528
00:22:12,969 --> 00:22:16,459
and I work at a place that I would say is doing it pretty good. Right?

529
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:19,290
I won't, I won't say we're perfect. Not that Red Hat was perfect either.

530
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:19,910
-- But,
-- but here's

531
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:22,140
in fairness, there is no

532
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,530
easy tooling or frameworks.

533
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,310
Like for example, there's no N PM as far as I know,

534
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:29,900
no CPA N PM or whatever framework where

535
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:34,319
you like tied into your C I system and it acts as a caching layer that also magically

536
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,219
actually, there are some

537
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:37,420
but

538
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,150
-- they're not
-- easy

539
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:38,890
-- to set up
-- more

540
00:22:39,189 --> 00:22:40,199
expensive.

541
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:41,339
And

542
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,219
I mean, it's part of the problem I think

543
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,239
of

544
00:22:45,969 --> 00:22:48,030
this is really hard to do

545
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,400
and it needs people because we don't have

546
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,750
any standardized anything today for dealing with this.

547
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,199
It's well,

548
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:59,459
I think part of the biggest problem is a lot of this problem exists

549
00:22:59,469 --> 00:23:03,780
not at the developer layer but at like the build and continuous integration layer,

550
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:04,619
right?

551
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:08,709
If it was at the a developer layer, you would just check the code into your git boom,

552
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:09,219
done, right?

553
00:23:09,229 --> 00:23:12,459
But that's not how these systems work. You have your code and get

554
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,069
and then when you build it or run it,

555
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:17,109
it automatically magically pulls in a whole pile of dependencies, right?

556
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:20,180
Like a deploy time, not a development time, right?

557
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,770
And so,

558
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,790
you know, uh well, for example,

559
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,109
like we the the the cloud security lines has several ruby

560
00:23:27,209 --> 00:23:29,939
on rails, applications for like the CCS K and stars.

561
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,650
And you know, we have the code that we've written in.

562
00:23:33,239 --> 00:23:33,650
Get

563
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:34,790
cool.

564
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:37,239
And then, you know, when we deploy it,

565
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,800
uh what is it called? Uh,

566
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,819
rail ties, whatever, whatever the thing that

567
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:45,780
magically pulls in all the dependencies is does that

568
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,500
on the server keeps them up to date?

569
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:49,660
And it's kind of like, well, you know,

570
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,459
yeah, how do we, how do we properly back that up in an easy way?

571
00:23:53,469 --> 00:23:55,619
I mean, I can back up the entire server. Cool.

572
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,979
But how do I kind of have say like rail ties or whatever

573
00:23:59,459 --> 00:24:04,479
kind of give me a cash copy of those in a, in a structured way that I can more easily use.

574
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,719
And the answer is there's not really a good, simple, easy answer for this,

575
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:09,020
you know,

576
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,699
um I know some major companies,

577
00:24:11,709 --> 00:24:15,489
what they do is they basically they block access to things like Ruby gems.org

578
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,790
and they run their own internal version of it and you know, they, they,

579
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,500
oh developer wants this package.

580
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,709
OK. We're going to go download that package, audit it, put it into our local,

581
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,380
you know, instance

582
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:29,579
and you can now use that and it's so it's now, you know, internally

583
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:31,260
copied and run.

584
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:31,939
Uh

585
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,750
And like that's gonna happen with maybe a

586
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,109
couple dozen or 100 companies around the globe,

587
00:24:37,739 --> 00:24:40,369
right? No developer is going to ever do that.

588
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,410
It's also hard because you need,

589
00:24:43,109 --> 00:24:47,010
that's a very specialized skill set and you, you need to be of a certain size.

590
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:50,329
I mean, start ups aren't going to be able to do this because it's very difficult.

591
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:50,819
Right.

592
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,079
It's, it's, it's hard

593
00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:55,329
and it gets even harder because

594
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:58,260
you might be pulling in one dependency and you think all right,

595
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,630
I'm gonna check out this dependency.

596
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,369
But then your dependency pulls in 20 dependencies and those

597
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,170
20 dependencies pull in 30 dependencies and it gets,

598
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,530
it gets really crazy.

599
00:25:07,109 --> 00:25:09,329
And that's where I think a lot of this

600
00:25:09,619 --> 00:25:13,310
kind of let, let's audit everything can start to fall apart because again,

601
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:16,569
it's turtles all the way down and it's, it's so hard.

602
00:25:16,579 --> 00:25:17,810
It's so crazy man.

603
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,410
And, and this, although I mean, I'll, I'll point out

604
00:25:20,709 --> 00:25:23,530
github is, is hopefully going to help deal with some of this

605
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,209
with their, their dependency checker they have.

606
00:25:26,219 --> 00:25:30,849
But even that I know is going to take probably years before I'd say it's,

607
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:32,010
it's good enough,

608
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:32,689
right?

609
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:34,290
This stuff is hard.

610
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:35,660
Yeah.

611
00:25:36,439 --> 00:25:39,180
Yeah, I mean, there are things that do this but again, it's,

612
00:25:39,489 --> 00:25:40,800
they're not really

613
00:25:40,989 --> 00:25:44,180
easy, automat, shareable. You know, there's no,

614
00:25:44,699 --> 00:25:46,099
like as far as I know,

615
00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:48,339
there's no like simple plug in that you can

616
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:50,459
basically like tie into your github and be like,

617
00:25:50,469 --> 00:25:53,339
so every time you build this, the C I system will magically

618
00:25:54,099 --> 00:25:54,859
do its thing.

619
00:25:54,869 --> 00:25:58,079
But also this other system will get a copy of everything and keep it

620
00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:00,670
and index it and catalog it and make sure it's the right one,

621
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,000
you know.

622
00:26:01,189 --> 00:26:04,280
Well, you know, what else? I think part of the issue here also is

623
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:06,280
what's the incentive to do this?

624
00:26:06,449 --> 00:26:07,180
There's a handful of.

625
00:26:08,689 --> 00:26:12,599
-- But yeah, it's, it's
-- too hard until it breaks horribly and, and,

626
00:26:12,699 --> 00:26:16,739
and well, the thing too to remember is so the left pad example is great.

627
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:21,199
You remove left pad from N PM and it breaks um a bajillion apps

628
00:26:22,229 --> 00:26:24,329
but fixing and replacing left pad on,

629
00:26:24,339 --> 00:26:28,349
on N PM took like one developer five minutes because he had a like a copy of it,

630
00:26:28,479 --> 00:26:31,880
right? Like it's open source, right? So he just uploaded a new copy,

631
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,390
took the names. Uh N PM allows you to take the name space of abandoned projects.

632
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:41,229
So basically one guy fixed it quickly by you know, re uploading it. Basically

633
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,170
you compare that to the effort of like

634
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,770
these million projects running local cash stuff.

635
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,109
Yeah.

636
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:47,410
No,

637
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:51,760
it's clearly a lot less work to have one guy fix it on N PM than to have a million people,

638
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,689
you know, build a bunker of of cached files in case you know,

639
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:57,989
the the end times come for that file,

640
00:26:59,829 --> 00:27:02,189
right? And that's part of the problem with a lot of these, you know,

641
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:04,189
uh solutions is that

642
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:07,540
kind of everybody has to do it to be safe, you know,

643
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,219
and that just

644
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:13,140
between expertise and scale and resources is just not going to happen.

645
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:16,030
So we end up with these centralized, you know, attempts at solutions.

646
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:18,829
Yes.

647
00:27:19,829 --> 00:27:20,760
And

648
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:21,530
man,

649
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:26,969
I don't know. I, I think about this one a lot and I don't know what the answer is today.

650
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:27,410
Uh,

651
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:30,329
there is a project that's really cool actually. Uh,

652
00:27:30,729 --> 00:27:32,949
some, some ex red hat guys.

653
00:27:32,989 --> 00:27:37,560
What is Tide Lift I think is the name of their company and it's libraries dot IO.

654
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,079
And it's, it's starting to track some of this stuff.

655
00:27:40,089 --> 00:27:42,030
They've got a long way to go, of course, but

656
00:27:42,229 --> 00:27:42,800
it's,

657
00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:44,689
it's the beginning I think.

658
00:27:44,699 --> 00:27:47,489
And if I was gonna put money on anybody today,

659
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,819
it would probably be those guys because one of my complaints I have and,

660
00:27:51,829 --> 00:27:53,819
and you and I discussed this often

661
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:59,900
is like we have a standard for tracking security flaws in software. It's called CV E

662
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,540
and how many of these private vulnerability database

663
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:05,560
type places actually use CV E consistently.

664
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:07,770
None of them. The answer is none of them.

665
00:28:07,969 --> 00:28:09,290
And I have a suspicion

666
00:28:09,709 --> 00:28:12,839
they don't have an incentive to use CV E because they want to

667
00:28:12,849 --> 00:28:16,680
say my database has more stuff in it than their database does.

668
00:28:16,689 --> 00:28:18,599
So I'm clearly better than you.

669
00:28:18,829 --> 00:28:22,510
And it's like, no, you're just all a bunch of idiots that's not,

670
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:24,380
you're not better than anybody

671
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,729
work together.

672
00:28:25,979 --> 00:28:30,040
Well, you know, it reminds me of antivirus companies, right? Like they, they all

673
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:30,520
the

674
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,479
amount of duplication of effort is

675
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:34,849
literally insane.

676
00:28:34,989 --> 00:28:36,489
Well, it used to be much worse.

677
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:40,290
I mean, I, I, from what I gather, they actually work together now to a degree.

678
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,770
-- But back in the day
-- they do, there is a lot of,

679
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:43,270
there's

680
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:45,655
of code samples and that's been around for a long time.

681
00:28:45,665 --> 00:28:45,954
But,

682
00:28:45,964 --> 00:28:48,795
but before that even I remember hearing stories

683
00:28:48,805 --> 00:28:50,824
back in the day where one antivirus company

684
00:28:50,834 --> 00:28:53,885
would literally write viruses to attack another antivirus

685
00:28:53,895 --> 00:28:55,564
company's product just so they can be like,

686
00:28:55,574 --> 00:28:57,675
look, our product catches this virus.

687
00:28:57,685 --> 00:29:00,625
There's a dozen. It's like, yeah, that's because you guys wrote it, man. Like

688
00:29:00,954 --> 00:29:01,814
no kidding.

689
00:29:03,369 --> 00:29:03,880
Yeah.

690
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,270
No, it's,

691
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:10,479
the reality is for people to do this correctly. It's kind of like backups.

692
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,739
It has to be

693
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,260
super easy

694
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,430
and super on by default

695
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:16,979
and require

696
00:29:17,229 --> 00:29:19,180
literally no effort

697
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:23,810
or so little effort. It's like you type in one command

698
00:29:24,219 --> 00:29:24,729
or something.

699
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:27,000
No, I agree with you 100%.

700
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:28,939
Right?

701
00:29:28,949 --> 00:29:30,469
Because I've, I've looked at this, you know,

702
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:32,290
for the CS A projects where I'm kind of paranoid.

703
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,729
Like, yeah, like what if one of our dependencies goes away,

704
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:37,890
then our outbreaks and I get yelled at and it's going to be a bad, bad week.

705
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,369
But the solution is like, oh my,

706
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:46,729
it's literally a minimum of tens, if not hundreds of hours of engineering.

707
00:29:47,339 --> 00:29:47,910
Right.

708
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:50,329
And, and the better question is

709
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,680
you've not spent hundreds of hours implementing a solution and

710
00:29:53,689 --> 00:29:56,520
how many times has your site or project broken?

711
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:57,900
Exactly.

712
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:02,479
And more of the point, you know, again, this, this kind of thing doesn't scale.

713
00:30:02,489 --> 00:30:03,380
Well, right.

714
00:30:03,619 --> 00:30:08,979
Every single person writing a Ruby Gem app that uses like these common things.

715
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,439
They're going to spend tens or hundreds of hours of

716
00:30:11,449 --> 00:30:13,959
engineering and ongoing maintenance and backing it up and blah,

717
00:30:13,969 --> 00:30:14,550
blah, blah, blah, blah.

718
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,020
And the answer is no, clearly we're not.

719
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,869
Right.

720
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:18,839
Right.

721
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:21,170
You know, because that's what's happened. The market has spoken.

722
00:30:21,939 --> 00:30:27,359
Uh and, and maybe it has, I, I feel like I wish we could fix this but you might be right.

723
00:30:27,489 --> 00:30:28,189
Maybe,

724
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,900
-- maybe it just never will get bad enough.
-- I don't know that we need to fix this.

725
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,359
It's like houses burning down,

726
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,479
houses, burn down and apparently over Christmas that it's about twice as likely

727
00:30:37,949 --> 00:30:39,630
for houses in North America to burn down. I

728
00:30:40,219 --> 00:30:40,449
guess. I

729
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:40,939
assume,

730
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,050
I don't know.

731
00:30:42,199 --> 00:30:42,569
Well,

732
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:44,089
you would think now with led lights it would

733
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:45,780
be very unlikely because they're so low voltage.

734
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:48,689
But I'm guessing it's more like people having fires and they

735
00:30:48,699 --> 00:30:51,890
haven't seen their chimneys in forever or people having candles.

736
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,209
Right? Like those big red,

737
00:30:53,339 --> 00:30:55,729
you know, Christmas candles that people seem to like, whatever the

738
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,969
point is, houses burn down and it really sucks when a house burns down,

739
00:31:00,579 --> 00:31:02,319
especially when it's minus 40 outside.

740
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,300
But the reality is houses burn down so rarely now that it's kind of like, well,

741
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:07,939
you know what?

742
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:08,910
Ok,

743
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:12,510
like we, we, we're not going to build, like in North America,

744
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,989
we build the majority of our, you know, houses out of wood, right?

745
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,540
Two by four plywood construction

746
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,920
and, you know, once they get going, they burn

747
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:25,670
right. There's condos locally, four story condos, several 100 units

748
00:31:25,819 --> 00:31:27,729
and they're just all plywood and two by four

749
00:31:28,069 --> 00:31:29,979
with like, you know, cinder block, uh,

750
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,680
cinder block staircases for the fire escape.

751
00:31:33,819 --> 00:31:35,209
And you are. Right.

752
00:31:35,459 --> 00:31:35,930
But

753
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:40,594
we didn't get to the point where if your house is burned down by luck. Right.

754
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:45,454
Oh, true. No building codes and, and, you know, lots of operational changes.

755
00:31:45,464 --> 00:31:48,775
Like people don't heat their houses by, uh, well,

756
00:31:48,785 --> 00:31:51,464
I was gonna say people don't heat their houses with, you know, wood fires,

757
00:31:51,474 --> 00:31:51,864
for example.

758
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:53,875
Although my neighbor right next to me does,

759
00:31:54,369 --> 00:31:57,839
um, you know, the majority of us have like natural gas furnaces now, which again,

760
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:01,310
generally are quite safe and tend not to catch fire or burn the house down.

761
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,790
So, yeah. No, we definitely didn't get here by just magic.

762
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,270
You know, we got here through a lot. Well, it's like the whole airline

763
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:08,790
disaster thing last year.

764
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:13,979
There weren't any and we got there through like decades of continuous improvement.

765
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:15,469
Right. You know,

766
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:19,439
like decades of, of technology, of operational changes.

767
00:32:19,449 --> 00:32:20,479
You know, things like, oh,

768
00:32:20,489 --> 00:32:24,640
maybe we should not make pilots fly for 18 hours straight because when they do,

769
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,329
they tend to get sleep,

770
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:26,060
you know,

771
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:30,479
what is it controlled? Descent into terrain? Right. They, they fly into things is

772
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:34,099
if you look at like the N PM and Rube GMS and all these things,

773
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:38,959
the number of times we have really bad massive problems that result in massive,

774
00:32:39,209 --> 00:32:39,829
you know,

775
00:32:40,489 --> 00:32:41,800
uh pain for people.

776
00:32:41,949 --> 00:32:43,280
It's really rare,

777
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:45,849
like it's so rare that when we look at the N PM thing,

778
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:47,420
there's essentially that one instant.

779
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:50,369
Well, there's two instances. The second instance being is that

780
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:53,369
N PM had some sort of weird technical glitch

781
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,369
and a bunch of packages weren't available for a while

782
00:32:55,619 --> 00:32:57,479
and something went wrong. Some

783
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:59,319
people tried to register the packages. And

784
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:02,859
so basically, there's two examples for N PM in a span of like two or three years.

785
00:33:02,869 --> 00:33:05,270
But there's an example every week we have a

786
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,010
podcast that we never run out of content for.

787
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:08,410
I mean,

788
00:33:09,199 --> 00:33:12,050
the Intel bug N PM, there's a million things

789
00:33:12,344 --> 00:33:13,324
going on. They're just

790
00:33:13,895 --> 00:33:13,994
when you

791
00:33:14,415 --> 00:33:15,094
consider how many

792
00:33:15,505 --> 00:33:19,114
different technologies and hardware solutions and things we're talking about,

793
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:20,685
you know, it's just like the real world,

794
00:33:21,094 --> 00:33:21,125
how

795
00:33:21,314 --> 00:33:21,435
many

796
00:33:21,795 --> 00:33:22,035
microwaves,

797
00:33:22,354 --> 00:33:24,415
right? And, and let's think about airplanes.

798
00:33:24,425 --> 00:33:27,405
There are thousands of ways an airplane can fail, right?

799
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:32,415
But the problem is the end result of an airplane crash is a catastrophic event.

800
00:33:32,425 --> 00:33:33,515
People can relate to

801
00:33:33,685 --> 00:33:37,935
the end result of a house burning down is a catastrophic event. People can relate to.

802
00:33:38,189 --> 00:33:42,650
The problem with software is the Intel bug is

803
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:46,189
maybe catastrophic, maybe not, it depends how you want to talk about it.

804
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:47,189
But fundamentally,

805
00:33:47,479 --> 00:33:50,589
the result of that problem is different than the result

806
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:53,810
of Equifax is different than the result of node.

807
00:33:53,819 --> 00:33:56,770
And I think the fact that we have this lack of consistency as

808
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:00,930
kind of our outcomes is what makes it difficult for people to understand

809
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:04,969
that these are related problems, but they are not the same problem.

810
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,530
Part of it is, it reminds me of heart bleed.

811
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,989
Um So when the openness cell, heart bleed bug came out,

812
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:16,478
normally, these things don't make the national news, however it did in Canada,

813
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:18,770
because revenue Canada had to shut down

814
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:22,918
their website for taking tax returns, which

815
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,708
it was a week before the deadline for taxes.

816
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,699
And so the final week of tax filing

817
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,000
electronically

818
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:32,760
didn't work, like they turned it off.

819
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,540
And so obviously that made the national news and they

820
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,340
had to extend the filing deadline and it was a,

821
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,120
you know, like

822
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:41,199
I remember my mom asking me about this because she heard about it on the news, right?

823
00:34:41,208 --> 00:34:44,560
Like the intel meltdown thing as far as I know, never made the news,

824
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:45,840
like the mainstream media,

825
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:46,949
like cnn.com,

826
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:52,350
it made the online news for sure. But like, was it on TV? I don't really think so.

827
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:56,199
I don't watch TV, but it was in the local newspaper for what it's worth?

828
00:34:56,668 --> 00:34:57,820
It did get a little b

829
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,840
I think the business section for me.

830
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:01,679
Ok.

831
00:35:02,629 --> 00:35:04,020
Yeah, normal people don't read that.

832
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:04,250
Uh,

833
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,689
probably not.

834
00:35:05,879 --> 00:35:08,820
I, I did have one normal person. I know

835
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,969
when they, they, I, I talk to them and they're like, so how's it going.

836
00:35:11,979 --> 00:35:15,449
I'm like, I've had better weeks. They said, oh, this is a chip thing, right?

837
00:35:15,459 --> 00:35:18,169
I said, wow. You know what that is? I'm impressed.

838
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,969
Well, no, they don't know what it is, they've heard about

839
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:21,419
it.

840
00:35:21,709 --> 00:35:23,090
And that's what I was going to say is the

841
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,510
next problem is for most of these technical failures.

842
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,250
Ok. Plane crashing and burning. Yeah, that's easy to understand.

843
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,850
House burning down, easy to understand,

844
00:35:31,399 --> 00:35:35,020
uh, the specter and you know, um meltdown bug.

845
00:35:35,229 --> 00:35:37,590
Not so easy to understand like true or false.

846
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,610
Do you have to patch the underlying hardware host?

847
00:35:39,939 --> 00:35:42,419
True? You always have to patch the underlying host.

848
00:35:42,739 --> 00:35:44,739
It doesn't matter what CPU you're running, you just,

849
00:35:45,189 --> 00:35:49,979
yeah, if it's, if it's like an X 86 processor, you almost guaranteed have to patch.

850
00:35:49,989 --> 00:35:50,530
Now,

851
00:35:50,669 --> 00:35:51,379
here's a question,

852
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,320
virtual machines

853
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:57,310
running on top of a patch toast. Do you need to patch the virtual machine?

854
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,949
I know the answer to that because it's yes, but many people

855
00:36:01,209 --> 00:36:04,030
-- don't.
-- Well, the answer is a little more subtle than that. It's

856
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:06,979
yes for virtual machine to other virtual machine attacks,

857
00:36:06,989 --> 00:36:09,229
but no for virtual machine to host attacks

858
00:36:10,189 --> 00:36:11,370
if the host is patched,

859
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,179
right? And so all of a sudden like

860
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:18,370
we've gone from simple to, oh, this is actually getting really messy, really fast.

861
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,080
And then what's the outcome of this book? Well, you can steal some data

862
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:24,600
in theory blah, blah, blah blah blah, right? It's not like

863
00:36:24,889 --> 00:36:28,909
it catches fire or it just fails. It's like, no, it's loads.

864
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,939
Exactly. Not like the movies.

865
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:32,159
And, you know, that's the thing,

866
00:36:32,169 --> 00:36:37,580
like most of the security flaws even trying to explain it,

867
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:40,800
you know, it becomes very complex, very rapidly.

868
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:42,770
And that was one thing I noticed about the meltdown.

869
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,560
Inspector coverage is everybody on Twitter

870
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,520
complaining incessantly about how the journalists were

871
00:36:46,625 --> 00:36:49,514
technical de tells wrong. It's like, of course they are.

872
00:36:49,655 --> 00:36:50,564
Right. Right.

873
00:36:50,895 --> 00:36:51,145
Like,

874
00:36:51,155 --> 00:36:54,044
ask somebody to explain how to change a wheel on

875
00:36:54,054 --> 00:36:56,804
a car and nine times out of 10 myself included,

876
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:59,524
I get it wrong because I always forget that you crack the nuts first

877
00:36:59,534 --> 00:37:02,084
and then put the thing on the jack and then loosen the nuts.

878
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:02,945
Right.

879
00:37:02,955 --> 00:37:07,155
My thinking is always jack the car up, take the, take the nuts off, take the wheel off,

880
00:37:07,165 --> 00:37:07,875
-- swap,
-- right.

881
00:37:07,885 --> 00:37:09,465
Spin that wheel. Right.

882
00:37:10,649 --> 00:37:13,469
I have done that so many times where I jack the car up that

883
00:37:13,479 --> 00:37:15,850
I go to take the wheel off and the wheel just spins and like,

884
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,530
put the car back down.

885
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,300
Then I loosen the nuts, then I put the car back up. Yeah,

886
00:37:20,689 --> 00:37:21,530
I've done it.

887
00:37:21,659 --> 00:37:21,679
Yeah,

888
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:22,209
exactly.

889
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:25,429
And that's a relatively simple thing that you can explain to a four

890
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:27,340
-- year old.
-- You think so? Like,

891
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,689
like specter and meltdown

892
00:37:30,175 --> 00:37:33,995
or, or heart bleed or poodle, like a downgrade attack.

893
00:37:34,004 --> 00:37:36,395
That's not really a downgrade problem if

894
00:37:36,524 --> 00:37:40,324
you know the server has like certificate ordering enabled blah, blah.

895
00:37:40,334 --> 00:37:40,854
You know what I mean?

896
00:37:40,864 --> 00:37:43,965
Like it just all of a sudden like people start and I'm talking about

897
00:37:43,975 --> 00:37:46,995
like technical people that their eyes just glaze over and they give up.

898
00:37:47,215 --> 00:37:50,395
Right. My, my take on the specter and meltdown is really easy

899
00:37:50,919 --> 00:37:52,770
if your vendor has provided patches,

900
00:37:53,139 --> 00:37:54,229
you install them.

901
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,139
And as far as microcode goes, uh you,

902
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:59,820
we're gonna have to wait for proper good microcode updates

903
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,090
and as soon as they come out, you install them and it

904
00:38:02,209 --> 00:38:05,340
literally boils down to like my phone strategy,

905
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:07,340
which is uh about once or twice a week.

906
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:08,530
I just run the updater

907
00:38:08,989 --> 00:38:10,010
and update everything.

908
00:38:10,689 --> 00:38:10,709
Yeah.

909
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,250
You know what else this reminds me of is I

910
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,280
remember when stack clash came out that one was,

911
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:17,919
it's been,

912
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:18,590
it's been a while.

913
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,169
That was the one where the stack and the heap

914
00:38:20,179 --> 00:38:23,199
you could get them to overlap and then you could essentially

915
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:24,550
like

916
00:38:24,709 --> 00:38:24,739
three

917
00:38:24,939 --> 00:38:25,739
months working on that one.

918
00:38:26,459 --> 00:38:26,479
I

919
00:38:28,399 --> 00:38:28,449
was,

920
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,719
I remember that one.

921
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:35,520
There were a lot of really smart people, I was talking to that, that they, they were,

922
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:36,270
they were confused.

923
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,070
And I remember one person was talking about how you can become

924
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:42,500
root with this and you could because of an attack against.

925
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,739
Was it pseudo I think?

926
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:47,800
But I said, explain to me how you can become route if we, if we,

927
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:49,899
if you don't have pseudo on the machine because

928
00:38:49,909 --> 00:38:52,060
the one of the machines in question didn't have pseudo

929
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:55,209
and he's telling me about how you can use this to overwrite kernel memory.

930
00:38:55,219 --> 00:38:55,699
And I'm like,

931
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:57,100
right,

932
00:38:57,219 --> 00:39:00,820
that's not how this works. And then I spent like an hour explaining the problem.

933
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:04,090
But, but like, that's the thing, right? This stuff is so hard.

934
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,540
Well, that's the thing.

935
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:09,620
Like, I mean, the stack clash stuff was at least it wasn't hardware. Thank goodness.

936
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:11,310
And I remember, you know, Kace

937
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,899
found it did a ton of good research.

938
00:39:12,909 --> 00:39:16,060
They were like, oh, we think we found a good solution one megabyte guard pages.

939
00:39:16,429 --> 00:39:18,149
And then Florian was like, no,

940
00:39:18,669 --> 00:39:22,350
if we're going to do the guard page route, we have to go with about 3.5 gigabytes.

941
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,110
And that's not really going to work on 32

942
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,560
bit systems because you can basically have three threats

943
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:27,580
and

944
00:39:28,429 --> 00:39:30,020
memory systems anymore, right?

945
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,060
Not like billions of devices

946
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:32,360
connected

947
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:32,879
to.

948
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:33,080
Yeah,

949
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:33,909
exactly.

950
00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:36,500
So, and then, you know, so the whole guard page thing was like, whoops,

951
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,010
that's really not going to work.

952
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,959
And, you know, and then it was like, OK, well,

953
00:39:40,389 --> 00:39:43,810
and, and then it got worse because it was like, OK, well, now we have to fix the kernel.

954
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,310
OK? And we have to fix

955
00:39:45,439 --> 00:39:46,030
GLIPS C

956
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,110
and we have to fix GCC.

957
00:39:49,379 --> 00:39:51,040
So all of a sudden we've gone from like, oh,

958
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:54,030
let's just increase guard size to let's start monkeying

959
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:58,179
around with fundamental memory primitives and how code compiles.

960
00:39:58,189 --> 00:40:01,280
-- Oh, and don't break anything while you're at it
-- and, and

961
00:40:01,459 --> 00:40:01,919
right,

962
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,360
and nothing changed

963
00:40:04,129 --> 00:40:04,360
and

964
00:40:04,465 --> 00:40:06,885
don't impact performance if you can while you're at it.

965
00:40:07,014 --> 00:40:08,195
That doesn't matter anyway.

966
00:40:08,245 --> 00:40:10,975
I think actually I saw a really funny tweet yesterday that it was,

967
00:40:10,985 --> 00:40:14,485
someone said you knew this was a security problem when someone posted a patch

968
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:18,314
that impacted performance and Linus didn't yell at them and called them an idiot.

969
00:40:18,324 --> 00:40:18,935
Like

970
00:40:20,064 --> 00:40:21,264
that's, that's true.

971
00:40:21,534 --> 00:40:22,445
That's very true.

972
00:40:23,024 --> 00:40:23,054
Yes.

973
00:40:23,745 --> 00:40:24,264
So,

974
00:40:24,425 --> 00:40:25,485
and you know, and, and,

975
00:40:25,495 --> 00:40:29,104
and it's funny to hear people complaining about the embargo for the, for this

976
00:40:29,455 --> 00:40:32,524
specter and meltdown thing because it's like, no, this was like

977
00:40:33,169 --> 00:40:36,550
crazy amounts of engineering for like seven months

978
00:40:37,389 --> 00:40:38,030
and

979
00:40:38,379 --> 00:40:40,510
like, it's still not done, right? Like

980
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:41,830
there are, what is it?

981
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,540
There's specter patches in the upstream Linux kernel and I don't

982
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:46,500
know at the time of the release of this podcast,

983
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,939
whether or not the meltdown patches will have landed in the,

984
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:50,090
in the Linux kernel tree.

985
00:40:50,689 --> 00:40:52,929
I don't think they're there quite yet.

986
00:40:52,939 --> 00:40:55,389
Like they have some good ideas of what they're going to do,

987
00:40:55,399 --> 00:40:56,870
-- but they haven't actually
-- done it.

988
00:40:56,879 --> 00:40:59,659
Meltdown patches. I thought they already patched meltdown

989
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,000
-- in the upstream kernel or
-- was it?

990
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,129
Oh, no, no, no, sorry. I got it.

991
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,780
Yeah. Meltdown got patched. It's specter that didn't get patched.

992
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:06,530
Sorry. Yeah. See, I

993
00:41:06,699 --> 00:41:09,310
like living and breathing this for two months in my brain is just, I

994
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:11,139
can't keep it straight anymore

995
00:41:11,489 --> 00:41:15,459
anyways point being is like, like the Linux kernel upstream still hasn't

996
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,370
completely finished dealing with this.

997
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:18,909
We're still,

998
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:22,090
there's still going to be microcode updates

999
00:41:22,429 --> 00:41:23,750
that are going to take

1000
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,050
a while

1001
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,530
uh conservatively to get it this fully, right?

1002
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,770
Like we have microcode updates right now that

1003
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:31,969
are causing problems, right?

1004
00:41:31,979 --> 00:41:34,149
If you Google it, there's like a lot of people that, you know,

1005
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:37,449
install these microcode updates and they're really not happy about what happened

1006
00:41:37,459 --> 00:41:40,560
again because this is like a hideously complex thing to fix.

1007
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:41,909
And so,

1008
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,850
you know, we really needed the embargo on this one because

1009
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:48,149
like you said, and I think the last podcast, you know, if,

1010
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:51,590
if you're trying to do like really complicated

1011
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,689
engineering with a whole pile of people screaming,

1012
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:54,530
hurry up at you,

1013
00:41:54,659 --> 00:41:59,750
you're going to make decisions that are going to turn out to be not so, so great.

1014
00:41:59,919 --> 00:42:01,370
No, I, I totally agree.

1015
00:42:01,379 --> 00:42:06,129
And so all right, so, but let's stop ranting about the problems because I,

1016
00:42:06,139 --> 00:42:07,189
I totally get that.

1017
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:07,469
But

1018
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,229
so, so let's come back to the point.

1019
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:12,489
Are things so bad

1020
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:17,330
or rather will things ever get bad enough that we will actually ever fix anything?

1021
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:23,469
Well, it's, we are fixing things in the sense of looking at this.

1022
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:29,850
We've traded problems. So for example, we we now have developers can trivially

1023
00:42:29,989 --> 00:42:32,739
build an application that pulls in a bunch of dependencies and it

1024
00:42:32,959 --> 00:42:34,610
basically always works.

1025
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:36,989
Like, I don't know if people remember 20 years ago,

1026
00:42:37,449 --> 00:42:40,510
but like what Java's solution was was

1027
00:42:40,979 --> 00:42:42,429
while you embed

1028
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,139
style.

1029
00:42:43,669 --> 00:42:48,419
And so like, I've literally seen Java apps with 14 layers of embedded jars,

1030
00:42:48,429 --> 00:42:49,310
Wars and ears.

1031
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:54,280
And it's great when you have the same jar in, in five other jars because they,

1032
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:55,439
they all depend on it

1033
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:56,310
at

1034
00:42:56,899 --> 00:42:59,500
multiple depths of the chain and everything,

1035
00:42:59,689 --> 00:43:00,040
you know.

1036
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:02,179
So that, I mean, well and back then you got to remember,

1037
00:43:02,189 --> 00:43:03,810
we didn't have as much bandwidth or servers.

1038
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:06,000
So like the solution was OK, you know,

1039
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:08,110
essentially statically compile this pilot stuff,

1040
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:10,389
you know, and things like ma

1041
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,659
didn't exist for those of you thinking just

1042
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:13,189
maven.

1043
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:15,199
Right? Yeah, exactly.

1044
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:17,379
And so on the one hand,

1045
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:21,239
we've created a pile of security problems, but on the other hand,

1046
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:25,290
we've actually solved a huge pile of real world problems where

1047
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:28,179
you know, that we're preventing developers from getting their jobs done

1048
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,179
and now developers can get their job done,

1049
00:43:30,189 --> 00:43:32,719
they can churn out code that works and does useful things

1050
00:43:32,909 --> 00:43:34,370
way faster.

1051
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:37,969
And you know what I'll take that I will take risk,

1052
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:41,320
you know, pretty much any business will take. OK?

1053
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:44,909
You can give me a working product with risk or alternatively, no risk,

1054
00:43:44,919 --> 00:43:46,790
no working product for six months.

1055
00:43:47,169 --> 00:43:50,239
Well, clearly, you know, if we can ship today, we can start selling.

1056
00:43:50,709 --> 00:43:52,489
-- So that's what we're going to do.
-- I agree

1057
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:52,949
with you

1058
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:53,689
100%.

1059
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:57,600
And here's the beauty too is, is on the one hand,

1060
00:43:57,610 --> 00:44:01,469
I hate this centralization of kind of, of power and failure.

1061
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,810
But on the other hand, it means we only have to fix it in one spot.

1062
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:07,780
That is a reasonable observation.

1063
00:44:08,219 --> 00:44:11,179
Like what if N PM changes the client so that it, locally,

1064
00:44:11,189 --> 00:44:14,129
it has a switch to locally cash stuff in a really intelligent way.

1065
00:44:15,179 --> 00:44:15,750
I know

1066
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:16,179
it

1067
00:44:16,409 --> 00:44:17,929
will that fix anything.

1068
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:18,770
I mean,

1069
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:22,739
well, you'd at least have a local copy when N pm.org forgets to renew their DNS.

1070
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:26,070
No, like, straight up, that'll happen someday.

1071
00:44:26,229 --> 00:44:30,209
If that happens, there's gonna be way bigger problems going on

1072
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,699
than cashing files locally.

1073
00:44:32,929 --> 00:44:38,139
They've only paid for the registration out to 2018 July.

1074
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:41,050
Like I, I have a bunch of important domains that are, like,

1075
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:43,550
registered out 10 years that I renew yearly

1076
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:47,540
with the idea being that if I forget to renew it for like five years, I, I have some,

1077
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:47,959
you know,

1078
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:52,260
-- some time to make sure I get it right.
-- I think I have a domain I need to renew.

1079
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:54,169
Actually, I should look into that.

1080
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:55,510
I,

1081
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:57,370
well, it's a dot Name

1082
00:44:57,550 --> 00:44:59,449
and, and I want to move it, but it's,

1083
00:44:59,459 --> 00:45:02,080
it's really painful actually to deal with dot Names because

1084
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:05,689
dot Name has such a bizarrely spotted history behind it.

1085
00:45:06,709 --> 00:45:08,419
Yeah. The, the intent being,

1086
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:12,959
uh, like, for example, I, if I went Josh dot Bresser dot Name,

1087
00:45:13,449 --> 00:45:15,979
I would have bought Josh dot Bresser dot Name but,

1088
00:45:15,989 --> 00:45:18,550
but nobody could ever control like Bresser dot Name.

1089
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,020
Right.

1090
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:22,989
With the, that was the idea and then it failed and then they let you buy anything.

1091
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,120
So I bought Bresser dot Name, which it doesn't even do anything.

1092
00:45:26,129 --> 00:45:27,439
I just own it because,

1093
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:32,629
and, and it's, yeah, it sucks now because actually doing anything useful with the,

1094
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:34,310
with that domain is painful.

1095
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:35,739
Yeah.

1096
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:37,620
-- So, anyway, but,
-- uh,

1097
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:41,830
no, I think part of it is on the one hand, it, it reminds me of Github.

1098
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:47,080
I am terrified that github will go evil one day. But on the flip side

1099
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:51,340
by having it centralized and having it well done centrally,

1100
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:54,120
it's made developers lives so

1101
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:54,560
much.

1102
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:55,479
Here's the thing.

1103
00:45:55,489 --> 00:45:57,590
Like, I look at the CV project and for,

1104
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,909
for like Miter and CV E to run a proper

1105
00:46:00,949 --> 00:46:04,389
GIT server publicly with accounts and with all that other stuff

1106
00:46:04,629 --> 00:46:07,870
versus, oh, it's free at github.com.

1107
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:08,080
Yeah.

1108
00:46:08,439 --> 00:46:10,389
No, I, I totally get that.

1109
00:46:11,439 --> 00:46:13,139
Well, here's so github

1110
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:17,219
is going to go evil someday. I mean, remember Source Forge,

1111
00:46:17,429 --> 00:46:19,689
those, those were the good things for a long time.

1112
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:22,979
And, oh man, every time I have to download the D band dot iso

1113
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,969
and I love the fact that in Firefox it's like, no,

1114
00:46:26,459 --> 00:46:27,620
it like blocks the domain

1115
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:29,659
so, or, or whatever the,

1116
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:31,379
you know, because it's like, so

1117
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:33,219
-- I know stupid
-- at this point.

1118
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,439
Yeah. No, I know. I, in fact, I downloaded

1119
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:39,500
Dan the other day and I was like, what is this? This is terrible

1120
00:46:39,909 --> 00:46:40,219
actually.

1121
00:46:40,229 --> 00:46:43,739
That's something I was thinking of somebody should put together like a mini

1122
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:43,959
is

1123
00:46:44,149 --> 00:46:44,659
o you know,

1124
00:46:44,669 --> 00:46:49,080
build one of these small container type operating systems that just let's face it.

1125
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:52,610
Dan doesn't do anything that exciting. Like I could probably do it in an hour.

1126
00:46:53,189 --> 00:46:54,139
But anyway,

1127
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:54,639
github

1128
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:56,379
is going to go evil someday

1129
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:56,879
and,

1130
00:46:56,889 --> 00:46:59,439
and N PM is probably going to become evil someday

1131
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:01,629
because I think it's just the nature of these things

1132
00:47:01,889 --> 00:47:02,399
and

1133
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,110
-- when that happens, it's
-- not that they go evil.

1134
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:08,600
It's that what their interests and my interests are no longer.

1135
00:47:09,429 --> 00:47:11,159
That's fair. That's fair. I don't.

1136
00:47:11,379 --> 00:47:14,959
Ok. OK. I, I like that better. That's, that's a nice way to put it.

1137
00:47:15,209 --> 00:47:17,560
But at the same time when that happens,

1138
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:20,110
it generally happens because the world has moved on

1139
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:21,179
github

1140
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:25,699
will become source forge when we're using whatever comes after github.

1141
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:26,860
Right?

1142
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:29,459
And I have no idea what that will be

1143
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:31,580
good. VR

1144
00:47:31,719 --> 00:47:34,360
Right? He has VR source control. That's it.

1145
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:34,810
Right.

1146
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:35,750
It'll be just like,

1147
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,659
uh was it the movie hackers where you're flying around the building?

1148
00:47:39,989 --> 00:47:40,889
Exactly.

1149
00:47:41,709 --> 00:47:46,179
Yeah. So, I mean, as far as actionable, actionable advice goes to people,

1150
00:47:46,429 --> 00:47:49,729
there are like various things in N PM and CP and

1151
00:47:49,739 --> 00:47:52,110
whatnot that will help you cash local copies of it.

1152
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,729
So, you know, you would at least have those if like I said, N pm.org

1153
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:57,449
goes away or if

1154
00:47:57,639 --> 00:48:00,620
somebody, some developer decides to delete something that, you know,

1155
00:48:00,629 --> 00:48:03,500
is a dependency of a dependency of a dependency of something you, you know,

1156
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:04,489
rely upon.

1157
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:05,620
Um,

1158
00:48:05,959 --> 00:48:08,780
but fundamentally, I mean, it's,

1159
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:10,729
it's up to the central organizations and I think

1160
00:48:10,739 --> 00:48:12,580
one of the biggest things that could help here

1161
00:48:12,969 --> 00:48:14,000
would be having,

1162
00:48:14,439 --> 00:48:16,459
you know, good transparency around.

1163
00:48:16,469 --> 00:48:20,139
What are the rules, what like what is the behavior we can expect?

1164
00:48:20,149 --> 00:48:26,060
Like under what circumstances might this package go away or get deleted or be,

1165
00:48:26,189 --> 00:48:29,449
you know, just otherwise something happened that I care about,

1166
00:48:30,209 --> 00:48:30,709
you know,

1167
00:48:30,959 --> 00:48:32,959
and I think that's one of the benefits like

1168
00:48:33,459 --> 00:48:36,629
of a lot of the open source projects like, you know, Debian, for example,

1169
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:39,909
they have some really clearly stated policy documents about when

1170
00:48:39,919 --> 00:48:44,060
and how and why they'll move or remove packages,

1171
00:48:44,969 --> 00:48:48,830
right? Like license violations or you know, the code blah, blah blah, right?

1172
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:53,020
-- And so you kind of know what to expect.
-- Well, yes

1173
00:48:53,169 --> 00:48:56,239
and I like that consistency, but at the same time,

1174
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:58,800
I think because of that policy and consistency,

1175
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:02,510
Debian also moves a lot slower than some of these other distributions do.

1176
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,360
Oh, totally. And,

1177
00:49:04,889 --> 00:49:05,199
and,

1178
00:49:05,209 --> 00:49:09,520
and we exist in a universe now where where speed is

1179
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:12,639
seen as kind of the the killer feature for many,

1180
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:13,520
many

1181
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:16,840
time to market has always been a thing and

1182
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:19,879
especially with software now time to market is like super

1183
00:49:20,709 --> 00:49:23,850
critical, especially with services, right? Because

1184
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:25,699
like a great example is Cloudflare,

1185
00:49:25,709 --> 00:49:28,659
Cloudflare could have built something totally amazing and beautiful

1186
00:49:28,669 --> 00:49:31,449
and engineered even more perfectly than what they built.

1187
00:49:31,949 --> 00:49:33,530
But, you know, if they'd waited a year,

1188
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:35,370
somebody else would have come along and eat their lunch,

1189
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:37,409
you know, same thing with github.

1190
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:37,810
Right.

1191
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:38,370
Github.

1192
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:38,629
I

1193
00:49:38,739 --> 00:49:41,340
remember github at the beginning. It was, it was good.

1194
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:45,500
I mean, it was hosting Git and that alone took away so much pain,

1195
00:49:45,639 --> 00:49:47,949
like, so, so much pain and then, you know,

1196
00:49:47,959 --> 00:49:51,110
they've continued to add and add and add features like this whole dependency,

1197
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,149
security checker thing is like, wow, that, ok.

1198
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:54,149
That's really cool.

1199
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:57,649
Yes. You know, stuff like that will, you know,

1200
00:49:58,070 --> 00:49:59,929
and they're getting to a point now where they kind

1201
00:49:59,939 --> 00:50:02,070
of have that moat around them where it's like,

1202
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,500
oh, I could totally move to some other G

1203
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:07,689
style hosting thing. But I would lose, well, at a minimum, I would lose the github

1204
00:50:07,949 --> 00:50:08,610
community

1205
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,120
right

1206
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:09,340
at

1207
00:50:11,479 --> 00:50:12,530
this point. It's,

1208
00:50:13,209 --> 00:50:15,409
there's nowhere better. I mean, let's face it.

1209
00:50:15,739 --> 00:50:16,030
Yeah.

1210
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:18,669
Well, there's nowhere as popular. It's like Facebook.

1211
00:50:18,969 --> 00:50:20,870
Are there other social networks?

1212
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,010
I guess

1213
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:23,989
I couldn't even name them

1214
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,550
certain people like Snapchat,

1215
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:31,639
which is not controlled by Facebook, the medium age people think Instagram is neat,

1216
00:50:31,649 --> 00:50:34,399
which Facebook owns and the old people like Facebook,

1217
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:36,679
that is pretty much the way of the world today.

1218
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:40,840
And, and I think that's actually a great example and I wonder

1219
00:50:41,159 --> 00:50:44,030
I should, I should look into this but, like, obviously I can understand, like,

1220
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,879
if your grandparents are on Facebook, Facebook isn't cool.

1221
00:50:46,889 --> 00:50:47,760
Let's face it.

1222
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,199
That's the reality of that.

1223
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:50,179
And

1224
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:54,159
if you look at development environments, is it generational?

1225
00:50:54,169 --> 00:50:56,830
I, I don't know actually because I mean, I remember back part

1226
00:50:56,969 --> 00:50:57,229
of it is

1227
00:50:57,419 --> 00:50:58,729
it is generational

1228
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:00,979
because one thing I've really noticed

1229
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,850
is the difference between cloud services being built by people

1230
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:07,100
who grew up with cloud that is to put up long

1231
00:51:07,229 --> 00:51:09,370
people around the age of 20 to 25

1232
00:51:09,834 --> 00:51:11,975
and the cloud stuff being built by

1233
00:51:12,334 --> 00:51:15,284
the older generation, a great example being Amazon web services,

1234
00:51:15,435 --> 00:51:16,814
they wrote the whole thing in Java

1235
00:51:17,014 --> 00:51:21,155
and now they're like, would we use a different technology stack if we built this?

1236
00:51:21,165 --> 00:51:25,334
Oh God, yes, except uh we've kind of invested in this and, you know,

1237
00:51:25,344 --> 00:51:28,655
we're not stupid enough to try and rewrite from scratch and go bankrupt,

1238
00:51:29,625 --> 00:51:30,135
you know.

1239
00:51:30,665 --> 00:51:30,955
Right.

1240
00:51:30,965 --> 00:51:32,074
Like literally,

1241
00:51:32,084 --> 00:51:34,054
if you tried to convince somebody under the age of

1242
00:51:34,064 --> 00:51:37,094
25 right now to write a major thing in Java,

1243
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:40,340
they'd be like, you mean javascript, right? Like no Js

1244
00:51:41,419 --> 00:51:43,510
like they, that would probably be their reaction.

1245
00:51:43,729 --> 00:51:45,909
Yes, I'm familiar with this problem.

1246
00:51:46,889 --> 00:51:47,860
It is

1247
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:49,649
at the same time though,

1248
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:54,129
I will say Java does solve some problems very nicely but speed

1249
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:54,520
in Java.

1250
00:51:56,040 --> 00:52:00,860
Well, Java is, it's provably it gets things done. I mean, Aws,

1251
00:52:01,379 --> 00:52:04,020
right? That is a heck of a successful software stack.

1252
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:08,310
But uh yeah, so I mean, I, I think part of, and part of it is the culture of like

1253
00:52:08,479 --> 00:52:11,379
you. And I, like, I literally remember back in um

1254
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:13,260
oh Lord, 1999

1255
00:52:13,489 --> 00:52:17,060
I taught a full day Linux security course at Vanguard Security Expo,

1256
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:20,040
which is mainframe security people back in the day

1257
00:52:20,479 --> 00:52:23,679
and about there were eight or nine people in the class

1258
00:52:24,649 --> 00:52:28,350
and I kind of had to at one point stop and explain client server computing

1259
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:32,570
in the sense of clients that were intelligent and not dumb.

1260
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:37,370
Like they got client server in the context of like, oh yeah, TN 3270 terminal, which

1261
00:52:37,689 --> 00:52:40,639
I'm guessing most people are going to have to Google or look up on Wikipedia.

1262
00:52:40,649 --> 00:52:44,320
If you're under the age of probably 40 you've probably never seen or heard of those.

1263
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:49,129
Um And so I had to explain to them kind of like why clients server computing with Linux

1264
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:51,209
and, you know, smart clients was a little bit different,

1265
00:52:51,219 --> 00:52:53,760
why there was a much different sort of security profile around that.

1266
00:52:55,419 --> 00:52:59,479
And it kind of, I think some of them were not super enchanted about, you know,

1267
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,810
having their security go from like a single machine to like, oh all the machines.

1268
00:53:04,129 --> 00:53:05,239
Um And you know,

1269
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:09,639
I I'm from that generational gap too where I look at a web app and I think about

1270
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:12,919
so how do we optimize processing on the back end versus, you know,

1271
00:53:12,929 --> 00:53:14,689
young people now are smart and they're like,

1272
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:16,479
just do it in javascript on the client,

1273
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:21,449
right? Scale out 100% right. For every client that connects,

1274
00:53:21,729 --> 00:53:22,959
that's a new server.

1275
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:26,540
But however, ironically

1276
00:53:26,979 --> 00:53:30,310
that is going to bring with it many of the same problems where you have,

1277
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:34,209
have issues with having to trust the client because you,

1278
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:34,729
and that

1279
00:53:34,919 --> 00:53:35,090
doesn't really

1280
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:35,909
matter a lot of

1281
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:39,500
-- apps.
-- Right. I mean, certain things, it certainly doesn't. I, I agree with that.

1282
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:39,699
Yeah.

1283
00:53:40,379 --> 00:53:45,219
Well, like banking apps, like, oh, you wanted to withdraw $73 billion? Cool.

1284
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:47,899
Yeah, you probably need to check those numbers on the back end. Right.

1285
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:48,639
Um,

1286
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:52,300
but fundamentally, I mean, especially with, like, games and stuff. Right. Like,

1287
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:56,449
anyways, the point being is that there is definitely a cultural divide

1288
00:53:56,590 --> 00:53:57,209
between,

1289
00:53:57,310 --> 00:53:58,780
like, as I kind of put it, there's,

1290
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:03,050
there's sort of the, the server client application mindset which, you know,

1291
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:10,969
roamed the earth and, uh, was supreme from like, what about 95 until 2005, 2008.

1292
00:54:11,629 --> 00:54:13,169
And then we kind of entered that

1293
00:54:13,699 --> 00:54:15,570
transition where clients became,

1294
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:19,449
like, even the worst client. Like, my cell phone is what?

1295
00:54:19,459 --> 00:54:22,090
Dual core with four gigs of ra M or something stupid.

1296
00:54:22,709 --> 00:54:25,209
Right. Like, I don't even know or care anymore. It'll run,

1297
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:25,830
it'll do,

1298
00:54:25,949 --> 00:54:29,290
-- like, it'll do augmented reality games on my phone.
-- Right.

1299
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:33,100
-- Actually, you know, if it's in my pocket
-- it probably has something crazy like six

1300
00:54:33,219 --> 00:54:33,810
cars or

1301
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:35,830
it, it, that's a funny thing.

1302
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:36,070
Now,

1303
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:39,399
it's even crazier because they're actually these chips now have like two low

1304
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:43,110
power cores and then they might have two or four high power cores.

1305
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:46,169
So when the phone is asleep it uses way less juice,

1306
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:48,290
which is awesome. Right.

1307
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:49,429
Yeah.

1308
00:54:49,649 --> 00:54:50,010
Yeah.

1309
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,270
And so,

1310
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:54,570
you know, and then there's this whole sort of cloud native client

1311
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,120
uh generation where like the client is essentially what we think of as

1312
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:02,570
a server as far as power and compute capability and storage goes.

1313
00:55:03,439 --> 00:55:05,679
Yeah. No, II, I totally get it.

1314
00:55:05,689 --> 00:55:08,820
-- So, all right,
-- let's my kids', ipads have 100 and 28 gigs of storage.

1315
00:55:08,899 --> 00:55:10,590
I remember seeing servers with,

1316
00:55:10,989 --> 00:55:13,949
well, I remember owning servers with one gig of storage and I was like,

1317
00:55:14,439 --> 00:55:16,250
I'll never fill this disk up.

1318
00:55:17,429 --> 00:55:17,919
Yeah.

1319
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:22,729
So, you know, there is definitely that generational divide with,

1320
00:55:22,739 --> 00:55:26,689
not just in language and, but in how they view the world,

1321
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:29,739
it's like those kids that pick up a phone and they're like like a dumb phone,

1322
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:30,800
like a cordless phone

1323
00:55:31,229 --> 00:55:34,689
and are like, what, where's the screen? Like why there's no touchscreen?

1324
00:55:34,699 --> 00:55:38,250
-- This is broken, what's going
-- on? Let's let's bring this one home.

1325
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:40,370
But you've got me thinking something

1326
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:41,409
is

1327
00:55:41,959 --> 00:55:42,810
maybe,

1328
00:55:43,709 --> 00:55:46,360
maybe we are solving yesterday's security

1329
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:48,629
problems and we're trying to project those

1330
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,370
problems onto the technology of today

1331
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:54,610
instead of building today's security solutions,

1332
00:55:55,399 --> 00:55:58,060
-- right? Everything you said,
-- I think

1333
00:55:58,070 --> 00:55:59,530
-- you're right. It resonates with
-- me.

1334
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:01,760
One example of this is, you know, if you do Dev

1335
00:56:01,939 --> 00:56:05,189
ops and our trial, who cares if you have a security flaw, we fixed it in five minutes

1336
00:56:05,439 --> 00:56:08,600
-- because you're definitely gonna have security flaws no matter what you, right
-- now,

1337
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:11,790
on that note though, you have to know about them is part of the trick

1338
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:12,550
and

1339
00:56:12,679 --> 00:56:15,780
that can be tricky, although I guess maybe just keep updating a

1340
00:56:15,889 --> 00:56:18,830
lot and, and then you don't care, continuous deployments.

1341
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,090
-- Yeah. I, I feel
-- like

1342
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:22,709
why, here's the thing,

1343
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:25,449
why bother tracking security flaws in your dependencies

1344
00:56:25,459 --> 00:56:27,070
if you update your dependencies every day?

1345
00:56:27,959 --> 00:56:29,260
Yes, I,

1346
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:30,169
but then,

1347
00:56:30,439 --> 00:56:34,979
but then we've gotten to the issue of ok, so I'm stating my dependencies every day.

1348
00:56:35,379 --> 00:56:38,979
Am I? Should I cash them locally? Should I care if they're cashed locally?

1349
00:56:38,989 --> 00:56:40,090
And, and I feel like

1350
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:44,899
everything we've talked about up till now about the supply chain is very much

1351
00:56:45,419 --> 00:56:49,260
the security problems of yesterday, not the security problems of today,

1352
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:51,659
but we're trying to project our solution onto today.

1353
00:56:51,669 --> 00:56:53,600
I need, I need to think about this. I think,

1354
00:56:54,179 --> 00:56:55,389
-- I think this might
-- have something,

1355
00:56:55,729 --> 00:56:57,560
one thing you and I fundamentally get wrong

1356
00:56:57,889 --> 00:57:00,310
is we look at software as something that ships.

1357
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,699
The majority of software

1358
00:57:02,949 --> 00:57:03,620
is

1359
00:57:03,909 --> 00:57:04,699
not shipped.

1360
00:57:04,709 --> 00:57:06,649
It's either used internally or it's provided as a

1361
00:57:06,659 --> 00:57:08,719
-- service
-- as a service is totally the future.

1362
00:57:08,729 --> 00:57:09,139
Man.

1363
00:57:09,149 --> 00:57:12,510
I mean, if you look even like elastic as a new company and our,

1364
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:17,340
our cloud offering obviously is it's becoming hugely popular, not that the other,

1365
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:19,100
the other stuff is hugely popular also.

1366
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:19,340
But

1367
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,229
yeah, as a serviceman, it's where it's at.

1368
00:57:23,439 --> 00:57:25,219
Well, from the customer perspective, it's easier.

1369
00:57:25,229 --> 00:57:27,179
And from the company perspective,

1370
00:57:27,379 --> 00:57:29,689
there's no more piracy and there's no more people not

1371
00:57:29,699 --> 00:57:31,330
paying their bills because they don't pay their bills.

1372
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:31,860
You turn it off.

1373
00:57:32,139 --> 00:57:33,659
-- Yes.
-- Well, and not only that,

1374
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:39,350
the, the, the dealing with support on something as a service is much nicer because

1375
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:43,719
you have basically access to everything. You can see the logs, right.

1376
00:57:43,729 --> 00:57:46,949
You can, you can figure out what's going on, you can say, oh, I see what, you know,

1377
00:57:46,959 --> 00:57:48,129
there's a mistake here.

1378
00:57:48,139 --> 00:57:49,770
I see you're trying to do this or

1379
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:52,139
it's, it's huge, man. I mean, I think

1380
00:57:52,790 --> 00:57:58,300
there are few instances where IC N A service being inferior to on prem today and I

1381
00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:00,439
know that that's something that people complain about and

1382
00:58:00,449 --> 00:58:02,199
there's a whole bunch of articles popping up.

1383
00:58:02,209 --> 00:58:04,139
It feels like since the new year talking about,

1384
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:06,439
oh, the public cloud is too expensive and insecure.

1385
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:08,600
And I'm like, yeah, you're who's paying you, right? You,

1386
00:58:08,919 --> 00:58:12,620
you didn't make this up. Someone's paying you to say that and I don't know who it is.

1387
00:58:12,629 --> 00:58:12,979
But

1388
00:58:13,629 --> 00:58:18,129
-- anyway,
-- well, I think there are, well, I think it's like any technology that

1389
00:58:18,449 --> 00:58:19,530
things like

1390
00:58:20,389 --> 00:58:23,370
the public cloud will definitely take off and eat up a huge part

1391
00:58:23,379 --> 00:58:27,800
of the market and there will always be those like niche situations or

1392
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:30,090
regulatory guidelines or whatever.

1393
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:30,770
Um

1394
00:58:30,909 --> 00:58:33,120
But yeah, to say blanket statements like,

1395
00:58:33,129 --> 00:58:36,280
oh the the cloud like I look at the CS A

1396
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:38,870
what we pay Amazon web services and the weird thing is

1397
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:42,520
we've consistently paid them the same amount plus or minus $100

1398
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,459
for four years.

1399
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:48,120
And we use more and more resources every month and year

1400
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:53,330
because Amazon keeps dropping their prices and they keep coming out with services.

1401
00:58:53,399 --> 00:58:54,580
So for example,

1402
00:58:54,929 --> 00:58:57,540
I no longer have to buy SSL certificates because

1403
00:58:58,229 --> 00:59:01,429
Amazon provides that for free. Right. Amazon certificate.

1404
00:59:01,719 --> 00:59:03,409
You, it's just free.

1405
00:59:03,879 --> 00:59:04,969
Yes. Right.

1406
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:10,209
And, and like a wild card certificate for a domain is like a couple 100 bucks a year.

1407
00:59:10,219 --> 00:59:10,969
And so

1408
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,090
two or three of those go

1409
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,409
like, wow, it's like 1000 bucks a year.

1410
00:59:14,649 --> 00:59:15,820
No, I know, man. I know.

1411
00:59:16,699 --> 00:59:19,209
All right, let's call it, let's call it. It's uh,

1412
00:59:19,469 --> 00:59:20,830
so anyway, let's just say this,

1413
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:23,560
uh parents stop projecting your problems and your Children.

1414
00:59:23,739 --> 00:59:24,090
Right.

1415
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:28,330
That's, that's what this is us as parents are projecting our security problems on,

1416
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:29,850
on the youth, the future and

1417
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:33,959
to youth. It's up to you to keep giving us a finger and telling us to go away.

1418
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:35,469
-- So there we go.
-- Problem

1419
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:37,610
-- solved. Don't trust anybody over 40. I
-- don't,

1420
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,409
don't just don't trust anybody. Right. It's much easier that way.

1421
00:59:40,419 --> 00:59:41,570
Don't, don't draw lines.

1422
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:43,330
It's fine. Anyway.

1423
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:45,229
All right,

1424
00:59:45,429 --> 00:59:48,520
